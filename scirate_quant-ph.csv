0,1603.03039,2016,3,11,88,Hand-waving and Interpretive Dance: An Introductory Course on Tensor Networks,Jacob C Bridgeman;Christopher T Chubb,"The curse of dimensionality associated with the Hilbert space of spin systems provides a significant obstruction to the study of condensed matter systems. Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes. These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states. The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file."
1,1604.07450,2016,4,27,83,Quantum Shannon Theory,John Preskill,"This is the 10th and final chapter of my book on Quantum Information, based on the course I have been teaching at Caltech since 1997. An earlier version of this chapter (originally Chapter 5) has been available on the course website since 1998, but this version is substantially revised and expanded. Topics covered include classical Shannon theory, quantum compression, quantifying entanglement, accessible information, and using the decoupling principle to derive achievable rates for quantum protocols. This is a draft, pre-publication copy of Chapter 10, which I will continue to update. See the URL on the title page for further updates and drafts of other chapters, and please send me an email if you notice errors."
2,1502.04573,2015,4,8,81,Undecidability of the Spectral Gap (full version),Toby S Cubitt;David Pérez-García;Michael M Wolf,"We show that the spectral gap problem is undecidable. Specifically, we construct families of translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice of $d$-level quantum systems ($d$ constant), for which determining whether the system is gapped or gapless is an undecidable problem. This is true even with the promise that each Hamiltonian is either gapped or gapless in the strongest sense: it is promised to either have continuous spectrum above the ground state in the thermodynamic limit, or its spectral gap is lower-bounded by a constant in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, this constant can be taken equal to the local interaction strength of the Hamiltonian. This implies that it is logically impossible to say in general whether a quantum many-body model is gapped or gapless. Our results imply that for any consistent, recursive axiomatisation of mathematics, there exist specific Hamiltonians for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms. These results have a number of important implications for condensed matter and many-body quantum theory."
3,1604.01790,2016,2,17,80,The Mathematics of Entanglement,Fernando G S L Brandão;Matthias Christandl;Aram W Harrow;Michael Walter,"These notes are from a series of lectures given at the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia on some topics of current interest in quantum information. While they aim to be self-contained, they are necessarily incomplete and idiosyncratic in their coverage. For a more thorough introduction to the subject, we recommend one of the textbooks by Nielsen and Chuang or by Wilde, or the lecture notes of Mermin, Preskill or Watrous. Our notes by contrast are meant to be a relatively rapid introduction into some more contemporary topics in this fast-moving field. They are meant to be accessible to advanced undergraduates or starting graduate students."
4,1601.07601,2016,1,29,74,Improved classical simulation of quantum circuits dominated by Clifford gates,Sergey Bravyi;David Gosset,"The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that a quantum circuit composed of Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Here we revisit this theorem and extend it to quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates, where T is the single-qubit 45-degree phase shift. We assume that the circuit outputs a bit string x obtained by measuring some subset of w qubits. Two simulation tasks are considered: (1) computing the probability of a given output x, and (2) sampling x from the output probability distribution. It is shown that these tasks can be solved on a classical computer in time $poly(n,m)+2^{0.5 t} t^3$ and $poly(n,m)+2^{0.23 t} t^3 w^4$ respectively, where t is the number of T-gates, m is the total number of gates, and n is the number of qubits. The proposed simulation algorithms may serve as a verification tool for medium-size quantum computations that are dominated by Clifford gates. The main ingredient of both algorithms is a subroutine for approximating the norm of an n-qubit state which is given as a linear combination of $\chi$ stabilizer states. The subroutine runs in time $\chi n^3 \epsilon^{-2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the relative error. We also develop techniques for approximating tensor products of ""magic states"" by linear combinations of stabilizer states. To demonstrate the power of the new simulation methods, we performed a classical simulation of a hidden shift quantum algorithm with 40 qubits, a few hundred Clifford gates, and nearly 50 T-gates."
5,1511.04206,2015,11,16,74,Quantum algorithms: an overview,Ashley Montanaro,"Quantum computers are designed to outperform standard computers by running quantum algorithms. Areas in which quantum algorithms can be applied include cryptography, search and optimisation, simulation of quantum systems, and solving large systems of linear equations. Here we briefly survey some known quantum algorithms, with an emphasis on a broad overview of their applications rather than their technical details. We include a discussion of recent developments and near-term applications of quantum algorithms."
6,1508.05949,2015,8,26,72,Experimental loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality using entangled electron spins separated by 1.3 km,B Hensen;H Bernien;A E Dréau;A Reiserer;N Kalb;M S Blok;J Ruitenberg;R F L Vermeulen;R N Schouten;Carlos Abellán;Waldimar Amaya;Valerio Pruneri;Morgan W Mitchell;Matthew Markham;Daniel Twitchen;David Elkouss;Stephanie Wehner;T H Taminiau;R Hanson,"For more than 80 years, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum theory have stimulated debate about the nature of reality. In his seminal work, John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local realist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an inequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to quantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades, numerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because of experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in loopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of high-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin readout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use of fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials testing the CHSH-Bell inequality $S \leq 2$ and find $S = 2.42 \pm 0.20$. A null hypothesis test yields a probability of $p = 0.039$ that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites produces data with a violation at least as large as observed, even when allowing for memory in the devices. This result rules out large classes of local realist theories, and paves the way for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness certification."
7,1511.00657,2015,11,3,70,Grover search and the no-signaling principle,Ning Bao;Adam Bouland;Stephen P Jordan,"Two of the key properties of quantum physics are the no-signaling principle and the Grover search lower bound. That is, despite admitting stronger-than-classical correlations, quantum mechanics does not imply superluminal signaling, and despite a form of exponential parallelism, quantum mechanics does not imply polynomial-time brute force solution of NP-complete problems. Here, we investigate the degree to which these two properties are connected. We examine four classes of deviations from quantum mechanics, for which we draw inspiration from the literature on the black hole information paradox. We show that in these models, the physical resources required to send a superluminal signal scale polynomially with the resources needed to speed up Grover's algorithm. Hence the no-signaling principle is equivalent to the inability to solve NP-hard problems efficiently by brute force within the classes of theories analyzed."
8,1606.03140,2016,6,13,66,Tsirelson's problem and an embedding theorem for groups arising from non-local games,William Slofstra,"Tsirelson's problem asks whether the commuting operator model for two-party quantum correlations is equivalent to the tensor-product model. We give a negative answer to this question by showing that there are non-local games which have perfect commuting-operator strategies, but do not have perfect tensor-product strategies. The weak Tsirelson problem, which is known to be equivalent to Connes embedding problem, remains open. The examples we construct are instances of (binary) linear system games. For such games, previous results state that the existence of perfect strategies is controlled by the solution group of the linear system. Our main result is that every finitely-presented group embeds in some solution group. As an additional consequence, we show that the problem of determining whether a linear system game has a perfect commuting-operator strategy is undecidable."
9,1504.00233,2015,4,2,64,Quantum Information Processing with Finite Resources - Mathematical Foundations,Marco Tomamichel,"One of the predominant challenges when engineering future quantum information processors is that large quantum systems are notoriously hard to maintain and control accurately. It is therefore of immediate practical relevance to investigate quantum information processing with limited physical resources, for example to ask: How well can we perform information processing tasks if we only have access to a small quantum device? Can we beat fundamental limits imposed on information processing with classical resources? This book will introduce the reader to the mathematical framework required to answer such questions. A strong emphasis is given to information measures that are essential for the study of devices of finite size, including Rényi entropies and smooth entropies. The presentation is self-contained and includes rigorous and concise proofs of the most important properties of these measures. The first chapters will introduce the formalism of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on norms and metrics for quantum states. This is necessary to explore quantum generalizations of Rényi divergence and conditional entropy, information measures that lie at the core of information theory. The smooth entropy framework is discussed next and provides a natural means to lift many arguments from information theory to the quantum setting. Finally selected applications of the theory to statistics and cryptography are discussed."
10,1609.05537,2016,9,20,62,Quantum Speed-ups for Semidefinite Programming,Fernando G S L Brandão;Krysta M Svore,"We give a quantum algorithm for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs). It has worst case running time n^1/2m^1/2s poly(log(n), log(m), R, 1/delta), with n and s the dimension and sparsity of the input matrices, respectively, m the number of constraints, delta the accuracy of the solution, and R an upper bound on the trace of the optimal solution. This gives a square-root unconditional speed-up over any classical method for solving SDPs both in n and m. We prove the algorithm cannot be substantially improved giving a Omega(n^1/2 + m^1/2) quantum lower bound for solving semidefinite programs with constant s, R and delta. We then argue that in some instances the algorithm offer even exponential speed-ups. This is the case whenever the quantum Gibbs states of Hamiltonians given by linear combinations of the input matrices of the SDP can be prepared efficiently on a quantum computer. An example are SDPs in which the input matrices have low-rank: For SDPs with the maximum rank of any input matrix bounded by r, we show the quantum algorithm runs in time poly(log(n), log(m), r, R, delta)m^1/2. The quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum Gibbs sampling and the multiplicative weight method. In particular it is based on an classical algorithm of Arora and Kale for approximately solving SDPs. We present a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need of solving an inner linear program which may be of independent interest."
11,1607.08473,2016,7,29,61,Quantum circuits and low-degree polynomials over F_2,Ashley Montanaro,"In this work we explore a correspondence between quantum circuits and low-degree polynomials over the finite field F_2. Any quantum circuit made up of Hadamard, Z, controlled-Z and controlled-controlled-Z gates gives rise to a degree-3 polynomial over F_2 such that calculating quantum circuit amplitudes is equivalent to counting zeroes of the corresponding polynomial. We exploit this connection, which is especially clean and simple for this particular gate set, in two directions. First, we give proofs of classical hardness results based on quantum circuit concepts. Second, we find efficient classical simulation algorithms for certain classes of quantum circuits based on efficient algorithms for classes of polynomials."
12,1607.05256,2016,7,19,60,The Complexity of Quantum States and Transformations: From Quantum Money to Black Holes,Scott Aaronson,"These are lecture notes from a weeklong course in quantum complexity theory taught at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, February 21-25, 2016. The focus is quantum circuit complexity---i.e., the minimum number of gates needed to prepare a given quantum state or apply a given unitary transformation---as a unifying theme tying together several topics of recent interest in the field. Those topics include the power of quantum proofs and advice states; how to construct quantum money schemes secure against counterfeiting; and the role of complexity in the black-hole information paradox and the AdS/CFT correspondence (through connections made by Harlow-Hayden, Susskind, and others). The course was taught to a mixed audience of theoretical computer scientists and quantum gravity / string theorists, and starts out with a crash course on quantum information and computation in general."
13,1411.5729,2014,11,18,59,Forrelation: A Problem that Optimally Separates Quantum from Classical Computing,Scott Aaronson;Andris Ambainis,"We achieve essentially the largest possible separation between quantum and classical query complexities. We do so using a property-testing problem called Forrelation, where one needs to decide whether one Boolean function is highly correlated with the Fourier transform of a second function. This problem can be solved using 1 quantum query, yet we show that any randomized algorithm needs ~sqrt(N)/log(N) queries (improving an ~N^1/4 lower bound of Aaronson). Conversely, we show that this 1 versus ~sqrt(N) separation is optimal: indeed, any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an O(N^1-1/2t)-query randomized algorithm. Thus, resolving an open question of Buhrman et al. from 2002, there is no partial Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is constant and whose randomized query complexity is linear. We conjecture that a natural generalization of Forrelation achieves the optimal t versus ~N^1-1/2t separation for all t. As a bonus, we show that this generalization is BQP-complete. This yields what's arguably the simplest BQP-complete problem yet known, and gives a second sense in which Forrelation ""captures the maximum power of quantum computation."""
14,1611.04471,2016,11,24,57,Adiabatic Quantum Computing,Tameem Albash;Daniel A Lidar,"Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) started as an approach to solving optimization problems, and has evolved into an important universal alternative to the standard circuit model of quantum computing, with deep connections to both classical and quantum complexity theory and condensed matter physics. In this review we give an account of most of the major theoretical developments in the field, while focusing on the closed-system setting. The review is organized around a series of topics that are essential to an understanding of the underlying principles of AQC, its algorithmic accomplishments and limitations, and its scope in the more general setting of computational complexity theory. We present several variants of the adiabatic theorem, the cornerstone of AQC, and we give examples of explicit AQC algorithms that exhibit a quantum speedup. We give an overview of several proofs of the universality of AQC and related Hamiltonian quantum complexity theory. We finally devote considerable space to Stoquastic AQC, the setting of most AQC work to date, where we discuss obstructions to success and their possible resolutions. To be submitted to Reviews of Modern Physics."
15,1602.07674,2016,11,15,57,Quantum Supremacy through the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm,Edward Farhi;Aram W Harrow,"The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is designed to run on a gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisfies a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. For certain problems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA can exhibit a form of Quantum Supremacy in that, based on reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to establishing quantum supremacy."
16,1510.02082,2015,2,25,57,Local Hamiltonians Whose Ground States are Hard to Approximate,Lior Eldar;Aram W Harrow,"Ground states of local Hamiltonians can be generally highly entangled: any quantum circuit that generates them (even approximately) must be sufficiently deep to allow coupling (entanglement) between any pair of qubits. Until now this property was not known to be ""robust"" - the marginals of such states to a subset of the qubits containing all but a small constant fraction of them may be only locally entangled, and hence approximable by shallow quantum circuits. In this work we construct a family of 16-local Hamiltonians for which any 1-10^-9 fraction of qubits of any ground state must be highly entangled. This provides evidence that quantum entanglement is not very fragile, and perhaps our intuition about its instability is an artifact of considering local Hamiltonians which are not only local but spatially local. Formally, it provides positive evidence for two wide-open conjectures in condensed-matter physics and quantum complexity theory which are the qLDPC conjecture, positing the existence of ""good"" quantum LDPC codes, and the NLTS conjecture due to Freedman and Hastings positing the existence of local Hamiltonians in which any low-energy state is highly-entangled. Our Hamiltonian is based on applying the hypergraph product by Tillich and Zemor to a classical locally testable code. A key tool in our proof is a new lower bound on the vertex expansion of the output of low-depth quantum circuits, which may be of independent interest."
17,1410.0951,2014,10,8,56,Local tests of global entanglement and a counterexample to the generalized area law,Dorit Aharonov;Aram W Harrow;Zeph Landau;Daniel Nagaj;Mario Szegedy;Umesh Vazirani,"We introduce a technique for applying quantum expanders in a distributed fashion, and use it to solve two basic questions: testing whether a bipartite quantum state shared by two parties is the maximally entangled state and disproving a generalized area law. In the process these two questions which appear completely unrelated turn out to be two sides of the same coin. Strikingly in both cases a constant amount of resources are used to verify a global property."
18,1511.02306,2015,10,6,54,Quantum linear systems algorithm with exponentially improved dependence on precision,Andrew M Childs;Robin Kothari;Rolando D Somma,"Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd showed that for a suitably specified $N \times N$ matrix $A$ and $N$-dimensional vector $\vec{b}$, there is a quantum algorithm that outputs a quantum state proportional to the solution of the linear system of equations $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$. If $A$ is sparse and well-conditioned, their algorithm runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(\log N, 1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired precision in the output state. We improve this to an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$, exponentially improving the dependence on precision while keeping essentially the same dependence on other parameters. Our algorithm is based on a general technique for implementing any operator with a suitable Fourier or Chebyshev series representation. This allows us to bypass the quantum phase estimation algorithm, whose dependence on $\epsilon$ is prohibitive."
19,1506.01396,2015,11,10,54,Trading classical and quantum computational resources,Sergey Bravyi;Graeme Smith;John A Smolin,"We propose examples of a hybrid quantum-classical simulation where a classical computer assisted by a small quantum processor can efficiently simulate a larger quantum system. First we consider sparse quantum circuits such that each qubit participates in O(1) two-qubit gates. It is shown that any sparse circuit on n+k qubits can be simulated by sparse circuits on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Secondly, we study Pauli-based computation (PBC) where allowed operations are non-destructive eigenvalue measurements of n-qubit Pauli operators. The computation begins by initializing each qubit in the so-called magic state. This model is known to be equivalent to the universal quantum computer. We show that any PBC on n+k qubits can be simulated by PBCs on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Finally, we propose a purely classical algorithm that can simulate a PBC on n qubits in a time $2^{c n} poly(n)$ where $c\approx 0.94$. This improves upon the brute-force simulation method which takes time $2^n poly(n)$. Our algorithm exploits the fact that n-fold tensor products of magic states admit a low-rank decomposition into n-qubit stabilizer states."
20,1411.2995,2014,6,5,54,Area laws and efficient descriptions of quantum many-body states,Yimin Ge;Jens Eisert,"It is commonly believed that area laws for entanglement entropies imply that a quantum many-body state can be faithfully represented by efficient tensor network states - a conjecture frequently stated in the context of numerical simulations and analytical considerations. In this work, we show that this is in general not the case, except in one dimension. We prove that the set of quantum many-body states that satisfy an area law for all Renyi entropies contains a subspace of exponential dimension. Establishing a novel link between quantum many-body theory and the theory of communication complexity, we then show that there are states satisfying area laws for all Renyi entropies but cannot be approximated by states with a classical description of small Kolmogorov complexity, including polynomial projected entangled pair states (PEPS) or states of multi-scale entanglement renormalisation (MERA). Not even a quantum computer with post-selection can efficiently prepare all quantum states fulfilling an area law, and we show that not all area law states can be eigenstates of local Hamiltonians. We also prove translationally invariant and isotropic instances of these results, and show a variation with decaying correlations using quantum error-correcting codes."
21,1611.05450,2016,11,13,53,Symmetry protected topological order at nonzero temperature,Sam Roberts;Beni Yoshida;Aleksander Kubica;Stephen D Bartlett,"We address the question of whether symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order can persist at nonzero temperature, with a focus on understanding the thermal stability of several models studied in the theory of quantum computation. We present three results in this direction. First, we prove that nontrivial SPT order protected by a global on-site symmetry cannot persist at nonzero temperature, demonstrating that several quantum computational structures protected by such on-site symmetries are not thermally stable. Second, we prove that the 3D cluster state model used in the formulation of topological measurement-based quantum computation possesses a nontrivial SPT-ordered thermal phase when protected by a global generalized (1-form) symmetry. The SPT order in this model is detected by long-range localizable entanglement in the thermal state, which compares with related results characterizing SPT order at zero temperature in spin chains using localizable entanglement as an order parameter. Our third result is to demonstrate that the high error tolerance of this 3D cluster state model for quantum computation, even without a protecting symmetry, can be understood as an application of quantum error correction to effectively enforce a 1-form symmetry."
22,1506.08834,2015,12,20,53,An improved semidefinite programming hierarchy for testing entanglement,Aram W Harrow;Anand Natarajan;Xiaodi Wu,"We present a stronger version of the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) hierarchy of approximations for the set of separable states. Unlike DPS, our hierarchy converges exactly at a finite number of rounds for any fixed input dimension. This yields an algorithm for separability testing which is singly exponential in dimension and polylogarithmic in accuracy. Our analysis makes use of tools from algebraic geometry, but our algorithm is elementary and differs from DPS only by one simple additional collection of constraints."
23,1504.06987,2015,7,1,51,Quantum speedup of Monte Carlo methods,Ashley Montanaro,"Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate numerical quantities which are hard to compute deterministically. One important example is the use in statistical physics of rapidly mixing Markov chains to approximately compute partition functions. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm which can accelerate Monte Carlo methods in a very general setting. The algorithm estimates the expected output value of an arbitrary randomised or quantum subroutine with bounded variance, achieving a near-quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm. Combining the algorithm with the use of quantum walks gives a quantum speedup of the fastest known classical algorithms with rigorous performance bounds for computing partition functions, which use multiple-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The quantum algorithm can also be used to estimate the total variation distance between probability distributions efficiently."
24,1311.3161,2013,12,9,50,Complexity classification of local Hamiltonian problems,Toby S Cubitt;Ashley Montanaro,"The calculation of ground-state energies of physical systems can be formalised as the k-local Hamiltonian problem, which is the natural quantum analogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems. One way of making the problem more physically meaningful is to restrict the Hamiltonian in question by picking its terms from a fixed set S. Examples of such special cases are the Heisenberg and Ising models from condensed-matter physics. In this work we characterise the complexity of this problem for all 2-local qubit Hamiltonians. Depending on the subset S, the problem falls into one of the following categories: in P; NP-complete; polynomial-time equivalent to the Ising model with transverse magnetic fields; or QMA-complete. The third of these classes has been shown to be StoqMA-complete by Bravyi and Hastings. The characterisation holds even if S does not contain any 1-local terms; for example, we prove for the first time QMA-completeness of the Heisenberg and XY interactions in this setting. If S is assumed to contain all 1-local terms, which is the setting considered by previous work, we have a characterisation that goes beyond 2-local interactions: for any constant k, all k-local qubit Hamiltonians whose terms are picked from a fixed set S correspond to problems either in P; polynomial-time equivalent to the Ising model with transverse magnetic fields; or QMA-complete. These results are a quantum analogue of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem for boolean constraint satisfaction problems."
25,1612.02437,2016,4,28,50,Multi-partite entanglement,Michael Walter;David Gross;Jens Eisert,"We give an introduction to the theory of multi-partite entanglement. We begin by describing the ""coordinate system"" of the field: Are we dealing with pure or mixed states, with single or multiple copies, what notion of ""locality"" is being used, do we aim to classify states according to their ""type of entanglement"" or to quantify it? Building on the general theory of multi-partite entanglement - to the extent that it has been achieved - we turn to explaining important classes of multi-partite entangled states, including matrix product states, stabilizer and graph states, bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states, addressing applications in condensed matter theory. We end with a brief discussion of various applications that rely on multi-partite entangled states: quantum networks, measurement-based quantum computing, non-locality, and quantum metrology."
26,1603.08675,2016,11,14,50,Quantum Recommendation Systems,Iordanis Kerenidis;Anupam Prakash,"A recommendation system uses the past purchases or ratings of $n$ products by a group of $m$ users, in order to provide personalized recommendations to individual users. The information is modeled as an $m \times n$ preference matrix which is assumed to have a good rank-$k$ approximation, for a small constant $k$. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that has running time $O(\text{poly}(k)\text{polylog}(mn))$. All known classical algorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an approximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix dimension. Our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of the preference matrix, without reconstructing the entire matrix. For this, we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a given vector onto the row space of a given matrix. This is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides an example of a quantum machine learning algorithm for a real world application."
27,1612.05903,2016,11,29,49,Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments,Scott Aaronson;Lijie Chen,"In the near future, there will likely be special-purpose quantum computers with 40-50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations for how to use such devices to demonstrate ""quantum supremacy"": that is, a clear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along the lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show that there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with sampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass. Compared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being sampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new algorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates in polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known algorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of the form ""if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH collapses""--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant versus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities. Fifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work implies that, if OWFs exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to such oracles. We show that some assumption is needed: if SampBPP=SampBQP and NP is in BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to such oracles."
28,1611.09274,2016,3,30,49,Normalizer Circuits and Quantum Computation,Juan Bermejo-Vega,"(Abridged abstract.) In this thesis we introduce new models of quantum computation to study the emergence of quantum speed-up in quantum computer algorithms. Our first contribution is a formalism of restricted quantum operations, named normalizer circuit formalism, based on algebraic extensions of the qubit Clifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard and $\pi/4$-phase gates): a normalizer circuit consists of quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs), automorphism gates and quadratic phase gates associated to a set $G$, which is either an abelian group or abelian hypergroup. Though Clifford circuits are efficiently classically simulable, we show that normalizer circuit models encompass Shor's celebrated factoring algorithm and the quantum algorithms for abelian Hidden Subgroup Problems. We develop classical-simulation techniques to characterize under which scenarios normalizer circuits provide quantum speed-ups. Finally, we devise new quantum algorithms for finding hidden hyperstructures. The results offer new insights into the source of quantum speed-ups for several algebraic problems. Our second contribution is an algebraic (group- and hypergroup-theoretic) framework for describing quantum many-body states and classically simulating quantum circuits. Our framework extends Gottesman's Pauli Stabilizer Formalism (PSF), wherein quantum states are written as joint eigenspaces of stabilizer groups of commuting Pauli operators: while the PSF is valid for qubit/qudit systems, our formalism can be applied to discrete- and continuous-variable systems, hybrid settings, and anyonic systems. These results enlarge the known families of quantum processes that can be efficiently classically simulated. This thesis also establishes a precise connection between Shor's quantum algorithm and the stabilizer formalism, revealing a common mathematical structure in several quantum speed-ups and error-correcting codes."
29,1503.06237,2015,3,24,49,Holographic quantum error-correcting codes: Toy models for the bulk/boundary correspondence,Fernando Pastawski;Beni Yoshida;Daniel Harlow;John Preskill,"We propose a family of exactly solvable toy models for the AdS/CFT correspondence based on a novel construction of quantum error-correcting codes with a tensor network structure. Our building block is a special type of tensor with maximal entanglement along any bipartition, which gives rise to an isometry from the bulk Hilbert space to the boundary Hilbert space. The entire tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed by Almheiri et. al in arXiv:1411.7041."
30,1501.04592,2015,1,20,48,Near-linear constructions of exact unitary 2-designs,Richard Cleve;Debbie W Leung;Li Liu;Juven C Wang,A unitary 2-design can be viewed as a quantum analogue of a 2-universal hash function: it is indistinguishable from a truly random unitary by any procedure that queries it twice. We show that exact unitary 2-designs on n qubits can be implemented by quantum circuits consisting of ~O(n) elementary gates in logarithmic depth. This is essentially a quadratic improvement in size (and in width times depth) over all previous implementations that are exact or approximate (for sufficiently strong approximations).
31,1503.07525,2015,3,27,48,Estimating outcome probabilities of quantum circuits using quasiprobabilities,Hakop Pashayan;Joel J Wallman;Stephen D Bartlett,"We present a method for estimating the probabilities of outcomes of a quantum circuit using Monte Carlo sampling techniques applied to a quasiprobability representation. Our estimate converges to the true quantum probability at a rate determined by the total negativity in the circuit, using a measure of negativity based on the 1-norm of the quasiprobability. If the negativity grows at most polynomially in the size of the circuit, our estimator converges efficiently. These results highlight the role of negativity as a measure of non-classical resources in quantum computation."
32,1501.00011,2015,1,5,48,Why now is the right time to study quantum computing,Aram W Harrow,"Quantum computing is a good way to justify difficult physics experiments. But until quantum computers are built, do computer scientists need to know anything about quantum information? In fact, quantum computing is not merely a recipe for new computing devices, but a new way of looking at the world that has been astonishingly intellectually productive. In this article, I'll talk about where quantum computing came from, what it is, and what we can learn from it."
33,1604.07422,2016,4,27,47,Single-world interpretations of quantum theory cannot be self-consistent,Daniela Frauchiger;Renato Renner,"According to quantum theory, a measurement may have multiple possible outcomes. Single-world interpretations assert that, nevertheless, only one of them ""really"" occurs. Here we propose a gedankenexperiment where quantum theory is applied to model an experimenter who herself uses quantum theory. We find that, in such a scenario, no single-world interpretation can be logically consistent. This conclusion extends to deterministic hidden-variable theories, such as Bohmian mechanics, for they impose a single-world interpretation."
34,1601.03030,2016,8,10,47,Simulated Quantum Annealing Can Be Exponentially Faster than Classical Simulated Annealing,Elizabeth Crosson;Aram W Harrow,"Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) is a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm that samples the equilibrium thermal state of a Quantum Annealing (QA) Hamiltonian. In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been proposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases it remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA. One piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing comes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric cost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an exponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal fluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing which passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time, arguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a comparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA efficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of this spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the growing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of tunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over classical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze only a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques applied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the quantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary distribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of SQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient."

More generally, we establish contextuality as a necessary resource for all schemes of quantum computation with magic states on qubits that satisfy three simple postulates. Furthermore, we identify stringent consistency conditions on such computational schemes, revealing the general structure by which negativity of Wigner functions, hardness of classical simulation of the computation, and contextuality are connected."
36,1502.04135,2015,11,30,47,Undecidability of the Spectral Gap (short version),Toby S Cubitt;David Pérez-García;Michael M Wolf,"The spectral gap - the energy difference between the ground state and first excited state - is central to quantum many-body physics. Many challenging open problems, such as the Haldane conjecture, existence of gapped topological spin liquid phases, or the Yang-Mills gap conjecture, concern spectral gaps. These and other problems are particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: given a quantum many-body Hamiltonian, is it gapped or gapless? Here we prove that this is an undecidable problem. We construct families of quantum spin systems on a 2D lattice with translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour interactions for which the spectral gap problem is undecidable. This result extends to undecidability of other low energy properties, such as existence of algebraically decaying ground-state correlations. The proof combines Hamiltonian complexity techniques with aperiodic tilings, to construct a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the evolution of a quantum phase-estimation algorithm followed by a universal Turing Machine. The spectral gap depends on the outcome of the corresponding Halting Problem. Our result implies that there exists no algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary model is gapped or gapless. It also implies that there exist models for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms of mathematics."
37,1411.7046,2014,2,17,47,A proposal for self-correcting stabilizer quantum memories in 3 dimensions (or slightly less),Courtney G Brell,"We propose a family of local CSS stabilizer codes as possible candidates for self-correcting quantum memories in 3D. The construction is inspired by the classical Ising model on a Sierpinski carpet fractal, which acts as a classical self-correcting memory. Our models are naturally defined on fractal subsets of a 4D hypercubic lattice with Hausdorff dimension less than 3. Though this does not imply that these models can be realised with local interactions in 3D Euclidean space, we also discuss this possibility. The X and Z sectors of the code are dual to one another, and we show that there exists a finite temperature phase transition associated with each of these sectors, providing evidence that the system may robustly store quantum information at finite temperature."
38,1404.5327,2014,11,27,47,A Non-Commuting Stabilizer Formalism,Xiaotong Ni;Oliver Buerschaper;Maarten Van den Nest,"We propose a non-commutative extension of the Pauli stabilizer formalism. The aim is to describe a class of many-body quantum states which is richer than the standard Pauli stabilizer states. In our framework, stabilizer operators are tensor products of single-qubit operators drawn from the group $\langle \alpha I, X,S\rangle$, where $\alpha=e^{i\pi/4}$ and $S=\operatorname{diag}(1,i)$. We provide techniques to efficiently compute various properties related to bipartite entanglement, expectation values of local observables, preparation by means of quantum circuits, parent Hamiltonians etc. We also highlight significant differences compared to the Pauli stabilizer formalism. In particular, we give examples of states in our formalism which cannot arise in the Pauli stabilizer formalism, such as topological models that support non-Abelian anyons."
39,1609.08579,2016,4,23,46,Markovian Marignals,Isaac H Kim,"We introduce a class of so called Markovian marginals, which gives a natural framework for constructing solutions to the quantum marginal problem. We consider a set of marginals that possess a certain internal quantum Markov chain structure. If they are equipped with such a structure and are locally consistent on their overlapping supports, there exists a global state that is consistent with all the marginals. The proof is constructive, and relies on a reduction of the marginal problem to a certain combinatorial problem. By employing an entanglement entropy scaling law, we give a physical argument that the requisite structure exists in any states with finite correlation lengths. This includes topologically ordered states as well as finite temperature Gibbs states."
40,1607.03236,2016,11,29,46,"Sequential measurements, disturbance and property testing",Aram W Harrow;Cedric Yen-Yu Lin;Ashley Montanaro,"We describe two procedures which, given access to one copy of a quantum state and a sequence of two-outcome measurements, can distinguish between the case that at least one of the measurements accepts the state with high probability, and the case that all of the measurements have low probability of acceptance. The measurements cannot simply be tried in sequence, because early measurements may disturb the state being tested. One procedure is based on a variant of Marriott-Watrous amplification. The other procedure is based on the use of a test for this disturbance, which is applied with low probability. We find a number of applications. First, quantum query complexity separations in the property testing model for testing isomorphism of functions under group actions. We give quantum algorithms for testing isomorphism, linear isomorphism and affine isomorphism of boolean functions which use exponentially fewer queries than is possible classically, and a quantum algorithm for testing graph isomorphism which uses polynomially fewer queries than the best algorithm known. Second, testing properties of quantum states and operations. We show that any finite property of quantum states can be tested using a number of copies of the state which is logarithmic in the size of the property, and give a test for genuine multipartite entanglement of states of n qubits that uses O(n) copies of the state. Third, correcting an error in a result of Aaronson on de-Merlinizing quantum protocols. This result claimed that, in any one-way quantum communication protocol where two parties are assisted by an all-powerful but untrusted third party, the third party can be removed with only a modest increase in the communication cost. We give a corrected proof of a key technical lemma required for Aaronson's result."

In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a ""break-even"" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20 times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an uncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the power of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction from confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system performance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system."

We focus on several trending topics including the foundations of statistical mechanics, resource theories, entanglement in thermodynamic settings, fluctuation theorems and thermal machines. This is not a comprehensive review of the diverse field of quantum thermodynamics; rather, it is a convenient entry point for the thermo-curious information theorist. Furthermore this review should facilitate the unification and understanding of different interdisciplinary approaches emerging in research groups around the world."
43,1411.3334,2014,7,13,46,Sparse Quantum Codes from Quantum Circuits,Dave Bacon;Steven T Flammia;Aram W Harrow;Jonathan Shi,"We describe a general method for turning quantum circuits into sparse quantum subsystem codes. The idea is to turn each circuit element into a set of low-weight gauge generators that enforce the input-output relations of that circuit element. Using this prescription, we can map an arbitrary stabilizer code into a new subsystem code with the same distance and number of encoded qubits but where all the generators have constant weight, at the cost of adding some ancilla qubits. With an additional overhead of ancilla qubits, the new code can also be made spatially local. Applying our construction to certain concatenated stabilizer codes yields families of subsystem codes with constant-weight generators and with minimum distance $d = n^{1-\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon = O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$. For spatially local codes in $D$ dimensions we nearly saturate a bound due to Bravyi and Terhal and achieve $d = n^{1-\epsilon-1/D}$. Previously the best code distance achievable with constant-weight generators in any dimension, due to Freedman, Meyer and Luo, was $O(\sqrt{n\log n})$ for a stabilizer code."

However, there is a worry that during the process of executing quantum gates by braiding anyons around each other, extra anyonic excitations will be created that will disorder the encoded quantum information. Here we explore this question in detail by studying adiabatic code deformations on Hamiltonians based on topological codes, notably Kitaev's surface codes and the more recently discovered color codes. We develop protocols that enable universal quantum computing by adiabatic evolution in a way that keeps the energy gap of the system constant with respect to the computation size and introduces only simple local Hamiltonian interactions. This allows one to perform holonomic quantum computing with these topological quantum computing systems. The tools we develop allow one to go beyond numerical simulations and understand these processes analytically."

We demonstrate how to factor products of large prime numbers using a compiled version of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Our technique can factor all products of $p,q$ such that $p,q$ are unequal primes greater than two, runs in constant time, and requires only two coherent qubits. This illustrates that the correct measure of difficulty when implementing Shor's algorithm is not the size of number factored, but the length of the period found."

Traditional machine learning has dramatically improved the benchmarking and control of experimental quantum computing systems, including adaptive quantum phase estimation and designing quantum computing gates. On the other hand, quantum mechanics offers tantalizing prospects to enhance machine learning, ranging from reduced computational complexity to improved generalization performance. The most notable examples include quantum enhanced algorithms for principal component analysis, quantum support vector machines, and quantum Boltzmann machines. Progress has been rapid, fostered by demonstrations of midsized quantum optimizers which are predicted to soon outperform their classical counterparts. Further, we are witnessing the emergence of a physical theory pinpointing the fundamental and natural limitations of learning. Here we survey the cutting edge of this merger and list several open problems."
47,1610.01664,2016,6,12,45,Quantum Proofs,Thomas Vidick;John Watrous,"Quantum information and computation provide a fascinating twist on the notion of proofs in computational complexity theory. For instance, one may consider a quantum computational analogue of the complexity class \classNP, known as QMA, in which a quantum state plays the role of a proof (also called a certificate or witness), and is checked by a polynomial-time quantum computation. For some problems, the fact that a quantum proof state could be a superposition over exponentially many classical states appears to offer computational advantages over classical proof strings. In the interactive proof system setting, one may consider a verifier and one or more provers that exchange and process quantum information rather than classical information during an interaction for a given input string, giving rise to quantum complexity classes such as QIP, QSZK, and QMIP* that represent natural quantum analogues of IP, SZK, and MIP. While quantum interactive proof systems inherit some properties from their classical counterparts, they also possess distinct and uniquely quantum features that lead to an interesting landscape of complexity classes based on variants of this model. In this survey we provide an overview of many of the known results concerning quantum proofs, computational models based on this concept, and properties of the complexity classes they define. In particular, we discuss non-interactive proofs and the complexity class QMA, single-prover quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class QIP, statistical zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class \classQSZK, and multiprover interactive proof systems and the complexity classes QMIP, QMIP*, and MIP*."

We start by showing that approximate symmetry operators---unitary operators whose commutators with the Hamiltonian have norms that are sufficiently small---which possess certain mutual commutation relations can be restricted to the ground space with low distortion. We generalize the Stone-von Neumann theorem to matrices that approximately satisfy the canonical (Heisenberg-Weyl-type) commutation relations, and use this to show that approximate symmetry operators can certify the degeneracy of the ground space even though they only approximately form a group. Importantly, the notions of ""approximate"" and ""small"" are all independent of the dimension of the ambient Hilbert space, and depend only on the degeneracy in the ground space. Our analysis additionally holds for any gapped band of sufficiently small width in the excited spectrum of the Hamiltonian, and we discuss applications of these ideas to topological quantum phases of matter and topological quantum error correcting codes. Finally, in our analysis we also provide an exponential improvement upon bounds concerning the existence of shared approximate eigenvectors of approximately commuting operators which may be of independent interest."

Several ensembles are known to be 2-designs, including the uniform distribution over the Clifford group, but no family of ensembles was previously known to form a 3-design. We prove that the Clifford group is a 3-design, showing that it is a better approximation to Haar-random unitaries than previously expected. Our proof strategy works for any distribution of unitaries satisfying a property we call Pauli 2-mixing and proceeds without the use of heavy mathematical machinery. We also show that the Clifford group does not form a 4-design, thus characterizing how well random Clifford elements approximate Haar-random unitaries. Additionally, we show that the generalized Clifford group for qudits is not a 3-design unless the dimension of the qudit is a power of 2."

We show that, if either of two plausible average-case hardness conjectures holds, then IQP computations are hard to simulate classically up to constant additive error. One conjecture relates to the hardness of estimating the complex-temperature partition function for random instances of the Ising model; the other concerns approximating the number of zeroes of random low-degree polynomials. We observe that both conjectures can be shown to be valid in the setting of worst-case complexity. We arrive at these conjectures by deriving spin-based generalisations of the Boson Sampling problem that avoid the so-called permanent anticoncentration conjecture."
51,1503.04035,2015,5,1,45,Gapped and gapless phases of frustration-free spin-1/2 chains,Sergey Bravyi;David Gosset,"We consider a family of translation-invariant quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for these systems to be gapped in the thermodynamic limit. More precisely, let $\psi$ be an arbitrary two-qubit state. We consider a chain of $n$ qubits with open boundary conditions and Hamiltonian $H_n(\psi)$ which is defined as the sum of rank-1 projectors onto $\psi$ applied to consecutive pairs of qubits. We show that the spectral gap of $H_n(\psi)$ is upper bounded by $1/(n-1)$ if the eigenvalues of a certain two-by-two matrix simply related to $\psi$ have equal non-zero absolute value. Otherwise, the spectral gap is lower bounded by a positive constant independent of $n$ (depending only on $\psi$). A key ingredient in the proof is a new operator inequality for the ground space projector which expresses a monotonicity under the partial trace. This monotonicity property appears to be very general and might be interesting in its own right. As an extension of our main result, we obtain a complete classification of gapped and gapless phases of frustration-free translation-invariant spin-1/2 chains with nearest-neighbor interactions."

We show that given any protocol offering a (sufficiently large) quantum advantage in communication complexity, there exists a way of obtaining measurement statistics which violate some Bell inequality. Our main tool is port-based teleportation. If the gap between quantum and classical communication complexity can grow arbitrarily large, the ratio of the quantum value to the classical value of the Bell quantity becomes unbounded with the increase in the number of inputs and outputs."

The number of logical qubits is unchanged by the procedure, while we give bounds on the increase in number of physical qubits and in the effect on distance and other code parameters, such as soundness (as a locally testable code) and ""cosoundness"" (defined later). Applications are discussed, including to codes from high-dimensional manifolds which have logarithmic weight stabilizers. Assuming a conjecture in geometry\citehdm, this allows the construction of CSS stabilizer codes with generator weight $O(1)$ and almost linear distance. Another application of the construction is to increasing the distance to $X$ or $Z$ errors, whichever is smaller, so that the two distances are equal."

Moreover, it is a minimal unitary 3-design except for dimension 4. As an immediate consequence, any orbit of pure states of the multiqubit Clifford group forms a complex projective 3-design; in particular, the set of stabilizer states forms a 3-design. By contrast, the Clifford group in any odd prime power dimension is only a unitary 2-design. In addition, we show that no operator basis is covariant with respect to any group that is a unitary 3-design, thereby providing a simple explanation of why no discrete Wigner function is covariant with respect to the multiqubit Clifford group."

56,1407.5088,2014,11,14,44,Quantum learning robust to noise,Andrew W Cross;Graeme Smith;John A Smolin,"Noise is often regarded as anathema to quantum computation, but in some settings it can be an unlikely ally. We consider the problem of learning the class of $n$-bit parity functions by making queries to a quantum example oracle. In the absence of noise, quantum and classical parity learning are easy and almost equally powerful, both information-theoretically and computationally. We show that in the presence of noise this story changes dramatically. Indeed, the classical learning problem is believed to be intractable, while the quantum version remains efficient. Depolarizing the qubits at the oracle's output at any constant nonzero rate does not increase the computational (or query) complexity of quantum learning more than logarithmically. However, the problem of learning from corresponding classical examples is the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, for which the best known algorithms have superpolynomial complexity. This creates the possibility of observing a quantum advantage with a few hundred noisy qubits. The presence of noise is essential for creating this quantum-classical separation."

In recent years, researchers in quantum computational complexity have tried to identify approaches and develop tools that address the question: does a quantum version of the PCP theorem hold? The story of this study starts with classical complexity and takes unexpected turns providing fascinating vistas on the foundations of quantum mechanics, the global nature of entanglement and its topological properties, quantum error correction, information theory, and much more; it raises questions that touch upon some of the most fundamental issues at the heart of our understanding of quantum mechanics. At this point, the jury is still out as to whether or not such a theorem holds. This survey aims to provide a snapshot of the status in this ongoing story, tailored to a general theory-of-CS audience."

A recent advance of Landau et al. gave a polynomial time algorithm to actually compute a succinct classical description for unique ground states of gapped 1D quantum systems. Despite this progress many questions remained unresolved, including whether there exist rigorous efficient algorithms when the ground space is degenerate (and poly($n$) dimensional), or for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D systems, or even whether such states admit succinct classical descriptions or area laws. In this paper we give a new algorithm for finding low energy states for 1D systems, based on a rigorously justified RG type transformation. In the process we resolve some of the aforementioned open questions, including giving a polynomial time algorithm for poly($n$) degenerate ground spaces and an $n^{O(\log n)}$ algorithm for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D systems (under a mild density condition). We note that for these classes of systems the existence of a succinct classical description and area laws were not rigorously proved before this work. The algorithms are natural and efficient, and for the case of finding unique ground states for frustration-free Hamiltonians the running time is $\tilde{O}(nM(n))$, where $M(n)$ is the time required to multiply two $n\times n$ matrices."
59,1510.02767,2015,8,12,43,Qubit stabilizer states are complex projective 3-designs,Richard Kueng;David Gross,"A complex projective $t$-design is a configuration of vectors which is ``evenly distributed'' on a sphere in the sense that sampling uniformly from it reproduces the moments of Haar measure up to order $2t$. We show that the set of all $n$-qubit stabilizer states forms a complex projective $3$-design in dimension $2^n$. Stabilizer states had previously only been known to constitute $2$-designs. The main technical ingredient is a general recursion formula for the so-called frame potential of stabilizer states. To establish it, we need to compute the number of stabilizer states with pre-described inner product with respect to a reference state. This, in turn, reduces to a counting problem in discrete symplectic vector spaces for which we find a simple formula. We sketch applications in quantum information and signal analysis."
60,1509.09180,2015,8,22,43,How to Verify a Quantum Computation,Anne Broadbent,"We give a new theoretical solution to a leading-edge experimental challenge, namely to the verification of quantum computations in the regime of high computational complexity. Our results are given in the language of quantum interactive proof systems. Specifically, we show that any language in BQP has a quantum interactive proof system with a polynomial-time classical verifier (who can also prepare random single-qubit pure states), and a quantum polynomial-time prover. Here, soundness is unconditional---i.e. it holds even for computationally unbounded provers. Compared to prior work achieving similar results, our technique does not require the encoding of the input or of the computation; instead, we rely on encryption of the input (together with a method to perform computations on encrypted inputs), and show that the random choice between three types of input (defining a computational run, versus two types of test runs) suffices. Because the overhead is very low for each run (it is linear in the size of the circuit), this shows that verification could be achieved at minimal cost compared to performing the computation. As a proof technique, we use a reduction to an entanglement-based protocol; this is the first time this technique has been used in the context of verification of quantum computations, and it enables a relatively straightforward analysis."
61,1408.5115,2014,7,21,43,Unbounded number of channel uses are required to see quantum capacity,Toby S Cubitt;David Elkouss;William Matthews;Maris Ozols;David Pérez-García;Sergii Strelchuk,"Transmitting data reliably over noisy communication channels is one of the most important applications of information theory, and well understood when the channel is accurately modelled by classical physics. However, when quantum effects are involved, we do not know how to compute channel capacities. The capacity to transmit quantum information is essential to quantum cryptography and computing, but the formula involves maximising the coherent information over arbitrarily many channel uses. This is because entanglement across channel uses can increase the coherent information, even from zero to non-zero! However, in all known examples, at least to detect whether the capacity is non-zero, two channel uses already suffice. Maybe a finite number of channel uses is always sufficient? Here, we show this is emphatically not the case: for any n, there are channels for which the coherent information is zero for n uses, but which nonetheless have capacity. This may be a first indication that the quantum capacity is uncomputable."
62,1612.06203,2016,10,1,42,Quantum speedup of the Travelling Salesman Problem for bounded-degree graphs,Dominic J Moylett;Noah Linden;Ashley Montanaro,"The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the most famous problems in graph theory. However, little is currently known about the extent to which quantum computers could speed up algorithms for the problem. In this paper, we prove a quadratic quantum speedup when the degree of each vertex is at most 3 by applying a quantum backtracking algorithm to a classical algorithm by Xiao and Nagamochi. We then use similar techniques to accelerate a classical algorithm for when the degree of each vertex is at most 4, before speeding up higher-degree graphs via reductions to these instances."
63,1612.04795,2016,10,12,42,The surface code with a twist,Theodore J Yoder;Isaac H Kim,"The surface code is one of the most successful approaches to topological quantum error-correction. It boasts the smallest known syndrome extraction circuits and correspondingly largest thresholds. Defect-based logical encodings of a new variety called twists have made it possible to implement the full Clifford group without state distillation. Here we investigate a patch-based encoding involving a modified twist. In our modified formulation, the resulting codes, called triangle codes for the shape of their planar layout, have only weight-four checks and relatively simple syndrome extraction circuits that maintain a high, near surface-code-level threshold. They also use 25% fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than the surface code. Moreover, benefiting from the twist, we can implement all Clifford gates by lattice surgery without the need for state distillation. By a surgical transformation to the surface code, we also develop a scheme of doing all Clifford gates on surface code patches in an atypical planar layout, though with less qubit efficiency than the triangle code. Finally, we remark that logical qubits encoded in triangle codes are naturally amenable to logical tomography, and the smallest triangle code can demonstrate high-pseudothreshold fault-tolerance to depolarizing noise using just 13 physical qubits."
64,1511.06526,2015,10,1,42,Sufficient Conditions for Efficient Classical Simulation of Quantum Optics,Saleh Rahimi-Keshari;Timothy C Ralph;Carlton M Caves,"We provide general sufficient conditions for the efficient classical simulation of quantum-optics experiments that involve inputting states to a quantum process and making measurements at the output. The first condition is based on the negativity of phase-space quasiprobability distributions (PQDs) of the output state of the process and the output measurements; the second one is based on the negativity of PQDs of the input states, the output measurements, and the transition function associated with the process. We show that these conditions provide useful practical tools for investigating the effects of imperfections in implementations of boson sampling. In particular, we apply our formalism to boson-sampling experiments that use single-photon or spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion sources and on-off photodetectors. Considering simple models for loss and noise, we show that above some threshold for the probability of random counts in the photodetectors, these boson-sampling experiments are classically simulatable. We identify mode mismatching as the major source of error contributing to random counts and suggest that this is the chief challenge for implementations of boson sampling of interesting size."
65,1411.6643,2014,9,27,42,Quantum memories at finite temperature,Benjamin J Brown;Daniel Loss;Jiannis K Pachos;Chris N Self;James R Wootton,"To use quantum systems for technological applications we first need to preserve their coherence for macroscopic timescales, even at finite temperature. Quantum error correction has made it possible to actively correct errors that affect a quantum memory. An attractive scenario is the construction of passive storage of quantum information with minimal active support. Indeed, passive protection is the basis of robust and scalable classical technology, physically realized in the form of the transistor and the ferromagnetic hard disk. The discovery of an analogous quantum system is a challenging open problem, plagued with a variety of no-go theorems. Several approaches have been devised to overcome these theorems by taking advantage of their loopholes. Here we review the state-of-the-art developments in this field in an informative and pedagogical way. We give the main principles of self-correcting quantum memories and we analyze several milestone examples from the literature of two-, three- and higher-dimensional quantum memories."
66,1410.6820,2014,11,23,42,Multipartite Quantum States and their Marginals,Michael Walter,"Subsystems of composite quantum systems are described by reduced density matrices, or quantum marginals. Important physical properties often do not depend on the whole wave function but rather only on the marginals. Not every collection of reduced density matrices can arise as the marginals of a quantum state. Instead, there are profound compatibility conditions -- such as Pauli's exclusion principle or the monogamy of quantum entanglement -- which fundamentally influence the physics of many-body quantum systems and the structure of quantum information. The aim of this thesis is a systematic and rigorous study of the general relation between multipartite quantum states, i.e., states of quantum systems that are composed of several subsystems, and their marginals. In the first part, we focus on the one-body marginals of multipartite quantum states; in the second part, we study general quantum marginals from the perspective of entropy."
67,1307.5143,2013,11,26,42,A polynomial-time algorithm for the ground state of 1D gapped local Hamiltonians,Zeph Landau;Umesh Vazirani;Thomas Vidick,"Computing ground states of local Hamiltonians is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. We give the first randomized polynomial-time algorithm for finding ground states of gapped one-dimensional Hamiltonians: it outputs an (inverse-polynomial) approximation, expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of polynomial bond dimension. The algorithm combines many ingredients, including recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D systems, convex programming, insights from classical algorithms for 1D satisfiability, and new techniques for manipulating and bounding the complexity of MPS. Our result provides one of the first major classes of Hamiltonians for which computing ground states is provably tractable despite the exponential nature of the objects involved."

Assuming a conjecture of Aaronson and Ambainis about optimal quantum speedups for partial functions, we improve this to $R(f)=\tilde{\Omega}(Q(f)^3)$. Our construction is motivated by the Göös-Pitassi-Watson function but does not use it."
69,1609.07877,2016,7,22,41,Finite correlation length implies efficient preparation of quantum thermal states,Fernando G S L Brandão;Michael J Kastoryano,"Preparing quantum thermal states on a quantum computer is in general a difficult task. We provide a procedure to prepare a thermal state on a quantum computer with a logarithmic depth circuit of local quantum channels assuming that the thermal state correlations satisfy the following two properties: (i) the correlations between two regions are exponentially decaying in the distance between the regions, and (ii) the thermal state is an approximate Markov state for shielded regions. We require both properties to hold for the thermal state of the Hamiltonian on any induced subgraph of the original lattice. Assumption (ii) is satisfied for all commuting Gibbs states, while assumption (i) is satisfied for every model above a critical temperature. Both assumptions are satisfied in one spatial dimension. Moreover, both assumptions are expected to hold above the thermal phase transition for models without any topological order at finite temperature. As a building block, we show that exponential decay of correlation (for thermal states of Hamiltonians on all induced subgraph) is sufficient to efficiently estimate the expectation value of a local observable. Our proof uses quantum belief propagation, a recent strengthening of strong sub-additivity, and naturally breaks down for states with topological order."
70,1604.02804,2016,6,29,41,Zero-knowledge proof systems for QMA,Anne Broadbent;Zhengfeng Ji;Fang Song;John Watrous,"Prior work has established that all problems in NP admit classical zero-knowledge proof systems, and under reasonable hardness assumptions for quantum computations, these proof systems can be made secure against quantum attacks. We prove a result representing a further quantum generalization of this fact, which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum zero-knowledge proof system. More specifically, assuming the existence of an unconditionally binding and quantum computationally concealing commitment scheme, we prove that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum interactive proof system that is zero-knowledge with respect to efficient quantum computations. Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers, but only requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations, provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA problem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described by Clifford operations and standard basis measurements. We believe that the QMA-completeness of this problem may have other uses in quantum complexity."
71,1602.04145,2016,12,6,41,Complexity classification of two-qubit commuting hamiltonians,Adam Bouland;Laura Mančinska;Xue Zhang,"We classify two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians in terms of their computational complexity. Suppose one has a two-qubit commuting Hamiltonian H which one can apply to any pair of qubits, starting in a computational basis state. We prove a dichotomy theorem: either this model is efficiently classically simulable or it allows one to sample from probability distributions which cannot be sampled from classically unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Furthermore, the only simulable Hamiltonians are those which fail to generate entanglement. This shows that generic two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians can be used to perform computational tasks which are intractable for classical computers under plausible assumptions. Our proof makes use of new postselection gadgets and Lie theory."
72,1510.08447,2015,4,12,41,An exponential time upper bound for Quantum Merlin-Arthur games with unentangled provers,Martin Schwarz,"We prove a deterministic exponential time upper bound for Quantum Merlin-Arthur games with k unentangled provers. This is the first non-trivial upper bound of QMA(k) better than NEXP and can be considered an exponential improvement, unless EXP=NEXP. The key ideas of our proof are to use perturbation theory to reduce the QMA(2)-complete Separable Sparse Hamiltonian problem to a variant of the Separable Local Hamiltonian problem with an exponentially small promise gap, and then to decide this instance using epsilon-net methods. Our results imply an exponential time algorithm for the Pure State N-Representability problem in quantum chemistry, which is in QMA(2), but is not known to be in QMA. We also discuss the implications of our results on the Best Separable State problem."
73,1510.05653,2015,2,15,41,Comparing Experiments to the Fault-Tolerance Threshold,Richard Kueng;David M Long;Andrew C Doherty;Steven T Flammia,"Achieving error rates that meet or exceed the fault-tolerance threshold is a central goal for quantum computing experiments, and measuring these error rates using randomized benchmarking is now routine. However, direct comparison between measured error rates and thresholds is complicated by the fact that benchmarking estimates average error rates while thresholds reflect worst-case behavior when a gate is used as part of a large computation. These two measures of error can differ by orders of magnitude in the regime of interest. Here we facilitate comparison between the experimentally accessible average error rates and the worst-case quantities that arise in current threshold theorems by deriving relations between the two for a variety of physical noise sources. Our results indicate that it is coherent errors that lead to an enormous mismatch between average and worst case, and we quantify how well these errors must be controlled to ensure fair comparison between average error probabilities and fault-tolerance thresholds."
74,1509.02374,2015,10,30,41,Quantum walk speedup of backtracking algorithms,Ashley Montanaro,"We describe a general method to obtain quantum speedups of classical algorithms which are based on the technique of backtracking, a standard approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Backtracking algorithms explore a tree whose vertices are partial solutions to a CSP in an attempt to find a complete solution. Assume there is a classical backtracking algorithm which finds a solution to a CSP on n variables, or outputs that none exists, and whose corresponding tree contains T vertices, each vertex corresponding to a test of a partial solution. Then we show that there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm which completes the same task using O(sqrt(T) n^(3/2) log n) tests. In particular, this quantum algorithm can be used to speed up the DPLL algorithm, which is the basis of many of the most efficient SAT solvers used in practice. The quantum algorithm is based on the use of a quantum walk algorithm of Belovs to search in the backtracking tree. We also discuss how, for certain distributions on the inputs, the algorithm can lead to an exponential reduction in expected runtime."
75,1612.01011,2016,10,21,40,Turning Gate Synthesis Errors into Incoherent Errors,Matthew B Hastings,"Using error correcting codes and fault tolerant techniques, it is possible, at least in theory, to produce logical qubits with significantly lower error rates than the underlying physical qubits. Suppose, however, that the gates that act on these logical qubits are only approximation of the desired gate. This can arise, for example, in synthesizing a single qubit unitary from a set of Clifford and $T$ gates; for a generic such unitary, any finite sequence of gates only approximates the desired target. In this case, errors in the gate can add coherently so that, roughly, the error $\epsilon$ in the unitary of each gate must scale as $\epsilon \lesssim 1/N$, where $N$ is the number of gates. If, however, one has the option of synthesizing one of several unitaries near the desired target, and if an average of these options is closer to the target, we give some elementary bounds showing cases in which the errors can be made to add incoherently by averaging over random choices, so that, roughly, one needs $\epsilon \lesssim 1/\sqrt{N}$. We remark on one particular application to distilling magic states where this effect happens automatically in the usual circuits."
76,1610.03507,2016,9,9,40,Quantum fault tolerance in small experiments,Daniel Gottesman,"I discuss a variety of issues relating to near-future experiments demonstrating fault-tolerant quantum computation. I describe a family of fault-tolerant quantum circuits that can be performed with 5 qubits arranged on a ring with nearest-neighbor interactions. I also present a criterion whereby we can say that an experiment has succeeded in demonstrating fault tolerance. Finally, I discuss the possibility of using future fault-tolerant experiments to answer important questions about the interaction of fault-tolerant protocols with real experimental errors."

Like Renner's proof, ours combines the post-selection de Finetti theorem, the Gentle Measurement lemma, and the Chernoff bound, but avoids virtually all calculations, including any use of the theory of types."
78,1505.03106,2015,10,13,40,Algebraic approach to quantum theory: a finite-dimensional guide,Cédric Bény;Florian Richter,"This document is meant as a pedagogical introduction to the modern language used to talk about quantum theories, especially in the field of quantum information. It assumes that the reader has taken a first traditional course on quantum mechanics, and is familiar with the concept of Hilbert space and elementary linear algebra. As in the popular textbook on quantum information by Nielsen and Chuang, we introduce the generalised concept of states (density matrices), observables (POVMs) and transformations (channels), but we also characterise these structures from an algebraic standpoint, which provides many useful technical tools, and clarity as to their generality. This approach also makes it manifest that quantum theory is a direct generalisation of probability theory, and provides a unifying formalism for both fields. Although this algebraic approach dates back, in parts, to John von Neumann, we are not aware of any presentation which focuses on finite-dimensional systems. This simplification allows us to have a self-contained presentation which avoids many of the technicalities inherent to the most general $C^*$-algebraic approach, while being appropriate for the quantum information literature."
79,1610.01808,2016,10,7,39,Achieving quantum supremacy with sparse and noisy commuting quantum computations,Michael J Bremner;Ashley Montanaro;Dan J Shepherd,"The class of commuting quantum circuits known as IQP (instantaneous quantum polynomial-time) has been shown to be hard to simulate classically, assuming certain complexity-theoretic conjectures. Here we study the power of IQP circuits in the presence of physically motivated constraints. First, we show that there is a family of sparse IQP circuits that can be implemented on a square lattice of n qubits in depth O(sqrt(n) log n), and which is likely hard to simulate classically. Next, we show that, if an arbitrarily small constant amount of noise is applied to each qubit at the end of any IQP circuit whose output probability distribution is sufficiently anticoncentrated, there is a polynomial-time classical algorithm that simulates sampling from the resulting distribution, up to constant accuracy in total variation distance. However, we show that purely classical error-correction techniques can be used to design IQP circuits which remain hard to simulate classically, even in the presence of arbitrary amounts of noise of this form. These results demonstrate the challenges faced by experiments designed to demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computation, and how these challenges can be overcome."
80,1605.00713,2016,8,18,39,Efficient Quantum Pseudorandomness,Fernando G S L Brandão;Aram W Harrow;Michał Horodecki,"Randomness is both a useful way to model natural systems and a useful tool for engineered systems, e.g. in computation, communication and control. Fully random transformations require exponential time for either classical or quantum systems, but in many case pseudorandom operations can emulate certain properties of truly random ones. Indeed in the classical realm there is by now a well-developed theory of such pseudorandom operations. However the construction of such objects turns out to be much harder in the quantum case. Here we show that random quantum circuits are a powerful source of quantum pseudorandomness. This gives the for the first time a polynomialtime construction of quantum unitary designs, which can replace fully random operations in most applications, and shows that generic quantum dynamics cannot be distinguished from truly random processes. We discuss applications of our result to quantum information science, cryptography and to understanding self-equilibration of closed quantum dynamics."
81,1512.05687,2015,3,9,39,Size-Driven Quantum Phase Transitions,Johannes Bausch;Toby S Cubitt;Angelo Lucia;David Pérez-García;Michael M Wolf,"Can the properties of the thermodynamic limit of a many-body quantum system be extrapolated by analysing a sequence of finite-size cases? We present a model for which such an approach gives completely misleading results: a translationally invariant local Hamiltonian on a square lattice with constant spectral gap and classical product ground state for system sizes smaller than a threshold, and a ground state with topological degeneracy for larger system sizes. Starting from a minimal case with spins of dimension 5 and threshold lattice size $15 \times 15$, we show that the latter grows faster than any computable function with increasing local dimensions. The resulting effect may be viewed as a new type of quantum phase transition that is driven by the size of the system rather than by a local field or coupling. It also suggests that recently proven undecidability results in quantum many-body systems may affect spin lattices with relatively small local Hilbert space dimension."
82,1508.06340,2015,5,13,39,Linear time algorithm for quantum 2SAT,Itai Arad;Miklos Santha;Aarthi Sundaram;Shengyu Zhang,"A canonical result about satisfiability theory is that the 2-SAT problem can be solved in linear time, despite the NP-hardness of the 3-SAT problem. In the quantum 2-SAT problem, we are given a family of 2-qubit projectors $\Pi_{ij}$ on a system of $n$ qubits, and the task is to decide whether the Hamiltonian $H=\sum \Pi_{ij}$ has a 0-eigenvalue, or it is larger than $1/n^\alpha$ for some $\alpha=O(1)$. The problem is not only a natural extension of the classical 2-SAT problem to the quantum case, but is also equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state of 2-local frustration-free Hamiltonians of spin $\frac{1}{2}$, a well-studied model believed to capture certain key properties in modern condensed matter physics. While Bravyi has shown that the quantum 2-SAT problem has a classical polynomial-time algorithm, the running time of his algorithm is $O(n^4)$. In this paper we give a classical algorithm with linear running time in the number of local projectors, therefore achieving the best possible complexity."
83,1507.05592,2015,12,19,39,The Power of Quantum Fourier Sampling,Bill Fefferman;Chris Umans,"A line of work initiated by Terhal and DiVincenzo and Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd, shows that quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability distributions that cannot be exactly sampled efficiently on a classical computer, unless the PH collapses. Aaronson and Arkhipov take this further by considering a distribution that can be sampled efficiently by linear optical quantum computation, that under two feasible conjectures, cannot even be approximately sampled classically within bounded total variation distance, unless the PH collapses. In this work we use Quantum Fourier Sampling to construct a class of distributions that can be sampled by a quantum computer. We then argue that these distributions cannot be approximately sampled classically, unless the PH collapses, under variants of the Aaronson and Arkhipov conjectures. In particular, we show a general class of quantumly sampleable distributions each of which is based on an ""Efficiently Specifiable"" polynomial, for which a classical approximate sampler implies an average-case approximation. This class of polynomials contains the Permanent but also includes, for example, the Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial, and many other familiar #P-hard polynomials. Although our construction, unlike that proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov, likely requires a universal quantum computer, we are able to use this additional power to weaken the conjectures needed to prove approximate sampling hardness results."
84,1410.0703,2014,11,1,39,On complexity of the quantum Ising model,Sergey Bravyi;Matthew B Hastings,"We study complexity of several problems related to the Transverse field Ising Model (TIM). First, we consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy known as the Local Hamiltonian Problem (LHP). It is shown that the LHP for TIM on degree-3 graphs is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the LHP for general k-local `stoquastic' Hamiltonians with any constant $k\ge 2$. This result implies that estimating the ground state energy of TIM on degree-3 graphs is a complete problem for the complexity class StoqMA - an extension of the classical class MA. As a corollary, we complete the complexity classification of 2-local Hamiltonians with a fixed set of interactions proposed recently by Cubitt and Montanaro. Secondly, we study quantum annealing algorithms for finding ground states of classical spin Hamiltonians associated with hard optimization problems. We prove that the quantum annealing with TIM Hamiltonians is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the quantum annealing with a certain subclass of k-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. This subclass includes all Hamiltonians representable as a sum of a k-local diagonal Hamiltonian and a 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonian."
85,1410.0664,2014,10,18,39,Quantum conditional mutual information and approximate Markov chains,Omar Fawzi;Renato Renner,A state on a tripartite quantum system $A \otimes B \otimes C$ forms a Markov chain if it can be reconstructed from its marginal on $A \otimes B$ by a quantum operation from $B$ to $B \otimes C$. We show that the quantum conditional mutual information $I(A: C | B)$ of an arbitrary state is an upper bound on its distance to the closest reconstructed state. It thus quantifies how well the Markov chain property is approximated.
86,1405.4502,2014,9,6,39,Disproving the Peres conjecture: Bell nonlocality from bipartite bound entanglement,Tamas Vértesi;Nicolas Brunner,"Quantum entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics, from quantum information science to many-body systems. In order to grasp the essence of this phenomenon, it is fundamental to understand how different manifestations of entanglement relate to each other. In 1999, Peres conjectured that Bell nonlocality is equivalent to distillability of entanglement. The intuition of Peres was that the non-classicality of an entangled state, as witnessed via Bell inequality violation, implies that pure entanglement can be distilled from this state, hence making it useful for most quantum information protocols. Subsequently, the Peres conjecture was shown to hold true in several specific cases, and became a central open question in quantum information theory. Here we disprove the Peres conjecture by showing that an undistillable bipartite entangled state---a bound entangled state---can nevertheless violate a Bell inequality. This shows that Bell nonlocality implies neither entanglement distillability, nor non-positivity under partial transposition, thus clarifying the relation between three fundamental aspects of entanglement. Finally, our results lead to a novel application of bound entanglement for device-independent randomness certification."

In this paper, we outline a simple classical model, and show that it achieves excellent correlation with published input-output behavior of the D-Wave One machine on 108 qubits. While raising questions about ""how quantum"" the D-Wave machine is, the new model also provides additional algorithmic insights into the nature of the native computational problem solved by the D-Wave machine."

Crucially, a quantum computer must not merely store information, but also process it. A fault-tolerant computational procedure ensures that errors do not multiply and spread. This review compares the leading proposals for promoting a quantum memory to a quantum processor. We compare magic state distillation, color code techniques and other alternative ideas, paying attention to relative resource demands. We discuss the several no-go results which hold for low-dimensional topological codes and outline the potential rewards of using high-dimensional quantum (LDPC) codes in modular architectures."

The argument is based on a lower bound on the classical communication complexity of a distributed variant of the Fourier sampling problem. We obtain two optimal quantum-classical separations as corollaries. First, a sampling problem which can be solved with one quantum query to the input, but which requires order-N classical queries for an input of size N. Second, a nonlocal task which can be solved using n Bell pairs, but for which any approximate classical solution must communicate 2^n bits, up to constant factors."

We prove that the partition function of any model in this family can be efficiently approximated to a given relative error E using a classical randomized algorithm with runtime polynomial in 1/E, system size, and inverse temperature. As a consequence we obtain a polynomial time algorithm which approximates the free energy or ground energy to a given additive error. We first show how to approximate the partition function by the perfect matching sum of a finite graph with positive edge weights. Although the perfect matching sum is not known to be efficiently approximable in general, the graphs obtained by our method have a special structure which facilitates efficient approximation via a randomized algorithm due to Jerrum and Sinclair."

A natural probe of randomness is the ""frame potential,"" which is minimized by unitary $k$-designs and measures the $2$-norm distance between the Haar random unitary ensemble and another ensemble. A natural probe of quantum chaos is out-of-time-order (OTO) four-point correlation functions. We show that the norm squared of a generalization of out-of-time-order $2k$-point correlators is proportional to the $k$th frame potential, providing a quantitative connection between chaos and pseudorandomness. Additionally, we prove that these $2k$-point correlators for Pauli operators completely determine the $k$-fold channel of an ensemble of unitary operators. Finally, we use a counting argument to obtain a lower bound on the quantum circuit complexity in terms of the frame potential. This provides a direct link between chaos, complexity, and randomness."

We show that the procedure proposed by Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost [Nat. Phys., 10(9):631--633, 2014] is optimal for this task. We further extend their method to the case of multiple input states, showing how to simulate any Hermitian polynomial of the states provided. As applications, we derive optimal algorithms for commutator simulation and orthogonality testing, and we give a protocol for creating a coherent superposition of pure states, when given sample access to those states. We also show that this sample-based Hamiltonian simulation can be used as the basis of a universal model of quantum computation that requires only partial swap operations and simple single-qubit states."

Using this tool, we study a generalization of Kitaev's code based on surfaces with mixed boundaries. This construction includes both Bravyi and Kitaev's and Freedman and Meyer's extension of Kitaev's toric code. We argue that our generalization offers a denser storage of quantum information. In a planar architecture, we obtain a three-fold overhead reduction over the standard architecture consisting of a punctured square lattice."

The idea is to identify approximate symmetries supported on thin strips through the bulk that behave as string operators associated to an anyon model. We can express these ribbon operators in matrix product form and define a cost function that allows us to efficiently optimize over this ansatz class. We test this method on spin models with abelian topological order by finding ribbon operators for $\mathbb{Z}_d$ quantum double models with local fields and Ising-like terms. In addition, we identify ribbons in the abelian phase of Kitaev's honeycomb model which serve as the logical operators of the encoded qubit for the quantum error-correcting code. We further identify the topologically encoded qubit in the quantum compass model, and show that despite this qubit, the model does not support topological order. Finally, we discuss how the method supports generalizations for detecting nonabelian topological order."
95,1601.07363,2016,8,2,38,T-count optimization and Reed-Muller codes,Matthew Amy;Michele Mosca,"We prove an equivalence between exactly minimizing the number of $T$ gates in $n$-qubit quantum circuits over $CNOT$ and $T$ gates, together with the Clifford group powers of $T$, and minimum distance decoding in the length $2^n-1$ punctured Reed-Muller code of order $n-4$. The equivalence arises from an analysis of the particular form of phase polynomials generated by $CNOT$ and $T$ gates. As a consequence, we derive an algorithm for the optimization of $T$-count in $\{CNOT, T\}$ quantum circuits based on Reed-Muller decoders, along with a new upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the number of $T$ gates required to implement an $n$-qubit unitary over $CNOT$ and $T$ gates. We further generalize this result to show that minimizing finer angle $Z$-rotations corresponds to decoding lower order binary Reed-Muller codes. In particular, we show that minimizing the number of $R_z(\pi/2^k)$ gates in circuits over $\{CNOT, R_z(\pi/2^k)\}$ corresponds to minimum distance decoding in the length $2^n-1$ punctured Reed-Muller code of order $(n-k-2)$."
96,1601.06101,2016,7,8,38,Inapproximability of the capacity of information stable finite state channels,David Elkouss;David Pérez-García,"The capacity of a noisy channel is the maximum asymptotic rate at which we can send information over it. For memoryless channels the capacity is given by a simple optimization problem as proven in Shannon's noisy coding theorem. Furthermore, for these channels, we have the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization problem and computes the capacity. What can be said about the general situation of channels with memory? In this work we consider one of the simplest families of such channels: the so-called finite state machine channels (FSMC). We show that there cannot exist any algorithm that approximates the capacity of every FSMC to within any desired precision. More concretely, we construct a subfamily S of information stable FSMC with 10 elements in the input alphabet and 62 states so that the capacity of each member is either greater or equal than 1 or less or equal than 1/2 and show that there cannot exist any algorithm that on input an element of S decides which is the case."
97,1511.01937,2015,6,24,38,Separations in query complexity using cheat sheets,Scott Aaronson;Shalev Ben-David;Robin Kothari,"We show a power 2.5 separation between bounded-error randomized and quantum query complexity for a total Boolean function, refuting the widely believed conjecture that the best such separation could only be quadratic (from Grover's algorithm). We also present a total function with a power 4 separation between quantum query complexity and approximate polynomial degree, showing severe limitations on the power of the polynomial method. Finally, we exhibit a total function with a quadratic gap between quantum query complexity and certificate complexity, which is optimal (up to log factors). These separations are shown using a new, general technique that we call the cheat sheet technique. The technique is based on a generic transformation that converts any (possibly partial) function into a new total function with desirable properties for showing separations. The framework also allows many known separations, including some recent breakthrough results of Ambainis et al., to be shown in a unified manner."
98,1409.7745,2014,1,28,38,Universal adiabatic quantum computation via the space-time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction,David Gosset;Barbara M Terhal;Anna Vershynina,"We show how to perform universal adiabatic quantum computation using a Hamiltonian which describes a set of particles with local interactions on a two-dimensional grid. A single parameter in the Hamiltonian is adiabatically changed as a function of time to simulate the quantum circuit. We bound the eigenvalue gap above the unique groundstate by mapping our model onto the ferromagnetic XXZ chain with kink boundary conditions; the gap of this spin chain was computed exactly by Koma and Nachtergaele using its $q$-deformed version of SU(2) symmetry. We also discuss a related time-independent Hamiltonian which was shown by Janzing to be capable of universal computation. We observe that in the limit of large system size, the time evolution is equivalent to the exactly solvable quantum walk on Young's lattice."
99,1408.1657,2014,1,25,38,Power law violation of the area law in quantum spin chains,Ramis Movassagh;Peter W Shor,"The sub-volume scaling of the entanglement entropy with the system's size, $n$, has been a subject of vigorous study in the last decade [1]. The area law provably holds for gapped one dimensional systems [2] and it was believed to be violated by at most a factor of $\log\left(n\right)$ in physically reasonable models such as critical systems. In this paper, we generalize the spin$-1$ model of Bravyi et al [3] to all integer spin-$s$ chains, whereby we introduce a class of exactly solvable models that are physical and exhibit signatures of criticality, yet violate the area law by a power law. The proposed Hamiltonian is local and translationally invariant in the bulk. We prove that it is frustration free and has a unique ground state. Moreover, we prove that the energy gap scales as $n^{-c}$, where using the theory of Brownian excursions, we prove $c\ge2$. This rules out the possibility of these models being described by a conformal field theory. We analytically show that the Schmidt rank grows exponentially with $n$ and that the half-chain entanglement entropy to the leading order scales as $\sqrt{n}$ (Eq. 16). Geometrically, the ground state is seen as a uniform superposition of all $s-$colored Motzkin walks. Lastly, we introduce an external field which allows us to remove the boundary terms yet retain the desired properties of the model. Our techniques for obtaining the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy, the gap upper bound and the self-contained expositions of the combinatorial techniques, more akin to lattice paths, may be of independent interest."

Quantum error correction provides this protection, by distributing a logical state among many physical qubits via quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an appealing platform, as it allows for constructing large quantum circuits, and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits the surface code is a natural choice for error correction, as it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly-cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: The per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99%. Here, we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92% and a two-qubit gate fidelity up to 99.4%. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerant threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits."
101,1305.4904,2013,2,26,38,Classical signature of quantum annealing,John A Smolin;Graeme Smith,"A pair of recent articles concluded that the D-Wave One machine actually operates in the quantum regime, rather than performing some classical evolution. Here we give a classical model that leads to the same behaviors used in those works to infer quantum effects. Thus, the evidence presented does not demonstrate the presence of quantum effects."
102,1308.6595,2013,1,20,37,The Church of the Symmetric Subspace,Aram W Harrow,"The symmetric subpace has many applications in quantum information theory. This review article begins by explaining key background facts about the symmetric subspace from a quantum information perspective. Then we review, and in some places extend, work of Werner and Chiribella that connects the symmetric subspace to state estimation, optimal cloning, the de Finetti theorem and other topics. In the third and final section, we discuss how the symmetric subspace can yield concentration-of-measure results via the calculation of higher moments of random quantum states. There are no new results in this article, but only some new proofs of existing results, such as a variant of the exponential de Finetti theorem. The purpose of the article is (a) pedagogical, and (b) to collect in one place many, if not all, of the quantum information applications of the symmetric subspace."
103,1509.04507,2015,9,30,37,The limits of Matrix Product State models,Miguel Navascués;Tamas Vértesi,"For the past twenty years, Tensor Network States (TNS) have been widely used to model the low energy sector of local Hamiltonians. Their success in doing so has led to the wide-held mantra that TNS of low bond dimension are the `only physical states' of natural condensed matter systems. However, given our experimental limitations to interact with such systems, it is not clear how this conjecture translates into any observable effect. In this Letter we give a first step in this direction by identifying particular operational features pertaining to all Matrix Product States (MPS), the class of TNS used to model non-critical one-dimensional spin chains. By exploiting two surprising structural constraints of MPS, we show how to systematically derive `bond dimension witnesses', or $k$-local operators whose expectation value allows us to lower bound the bond dimension of the underlying quantum state. We extend some of these results to the ansatz of Projected Entangled Pairs States (PEPS). As a bonus, we use our insight on the structure of MPS to: a) derive some limitations on the use of MPS and PEPS for ground state energy computations; b) show how to decrease the complexity and boost the speed of convergence of the semidefinite programming hierarchies described in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 020501 (2015)] for the characterization of finite-dimensional quantum correlations."
104,1605.05039,2016,8,8,37,Practical adaptive quantum tomography,Christopher E Granade;Christopher Ferrie;Steven T Flammia,"We introduce a fast and accurate heuristic for adaptive tomography that addresses many of the limitations of prior methods. Previous approaches were either too computationally intensive or tailored to handle special cases such as single qubits or pure states. By contrast, our approach combines the efficiency of online optimization with generally applicable and well-motivated data-processing techniques. We numerically demonstrate these advantages in several scenarios including mixed states, higher-dimensional systems, and restricted measurements."
105,1609.00735,2016,2,21,37,Complexity of quantum impurity problems,Sergey Bravyi;David Gosset,"We give a quasi-polynomial time classical algorithm for estimating the ground state energy and for computing low energy states of quantum impurity models. Such models describe a bath of free fermions coupled to a small interacting subsystem called an impurity. The full system consists of $n$ fermionic modes and has a Hamiltonian $H=H_0+H_{imp}$, where $H_0$ is quadratic in creation-annihilation operators and $H_{imp}$ is an arbitrary Hamiltonian acting on a subset of $O(1)$ modes. We show that the ground energy of $H$ can be approximated with an additive error $2^{-b}$ in time $n^3 \exp{[O(b^3)]}$. Our algorithm also finds a low energy state that achieves this approximation. The low energy state is represented as a superposition of $\exp{[O(b^3)]}$ fermionic Gaussian states. To arrive at this result we prove several theorems concerning exact ground states of impurity models. In particular, we show that eigenvalues of the ground state covariance matrix decay exponentially with the exponent depending very mildly on the spectral gap of $H_0$. A key ingredient of our proof is Zolotarev's rational approximation to the $\sqrt{x}$ function. We anticipate that our algorithms may be used in hybrid quantum-classical simulations of strongly correlated materials based on dynamical mean field theory. We implemented a simplified practical version of our algorithm and benchmarked it using the single impurity Anderson model."
106,1607.06843,2016,5,22,37,High dimension and symmetries in quantum information theory,Cécilia Lancien,"If a one-phrase summary of the subject of this thesis were required, it would be something like: miscellaneous large (but finite) dimensional phenomena in quantum information theory. That said, it could nonetheless be helpful to briefly elaborate. Starting from the observation that quantum physics unavoidably has to deal with high dimensional objects, basically two routes can be taken: either try and reduce their study to that of lower dimensional ones, or try and understand what kind of universal properties might precisely emerge in this regime. We actually do not choose which of these two attitudes to follow here, and rather oscillate between one and the other. In the first part of this manuscript, our aim is to reduce as much as possible the complexity of certain quantum processes, while of course still preserving their essential characteristics. The two types of processes we are interested in are quantum channels and quantum measurements. Oppositely, the second part of this manuscript is specifically dedicated to the analysis of high dimensional quantum systems and some of their typical features. Stress is put on multipartite systems and on entanglement-related properties of theirs. In the third part of this manuscript we eventually come back to a more dimensionality reduction state of mind. This time though, the strategy is to make use of the symmetries inherent to each particular situation we are looking at in order to derive a problem-dependent simplification."
107,1607.01796,2016,8,30,37,Entropy accumulation,Frédéric Dupuis;Omar Fawzi;Renato Renner,"We ask the question whether entropy accumulates, in the sense that the operationally relevant total uncertainty about an $n$-partite system $A = (A_1, \ldots A_n)$ corresponds to the sum of the entropies of its parts $A_i$. The Asymptotic Equipartition Property implies that this is indeed the case to first order in $n$, under the assumption that the parts $A_i$ are identical and independent of each other. Here we show that entropy accumulation occurs more generally, i.e., without an independence assumption, provided one quantifies the uncertainty about the individual systems $A_i$ by the von Neumann entropy of suitably chosen conditional states. The analysis of a large system can hence be reduced to the study of its parts. This is relevant for applications. In device-independent cryptography, for instance, the approach yields essentially optimal security bounds valid for general attacks, as shown by Arnon-Friedman et al."
108,1604.01384,2016,9,16,37,A Complete Characterization of Unitary Quantum Space,Bill Fefferman;Cedric Yen-Yu Lin,"Motivated by understanding the power of quantum computation with restricted number of qubits, we give two complete characterizations of unitary quantum space bounded computation. First we show that approximating an element of the inverse of a well-conditioned efficiently encoded $2^{k(n)}\times 2^{k(n)}$ matrix is complete for the class of problems solvable by quantum circuits acting on $\mathcal{O}(k(n))$ qubits with all measurements at the end of the computation. Similarly, estimating the minimum eigenvalue of an efficiently encoded Hermitian $2^{k(n)}\times 2^{k(n)}$ matrix is also complete for this class. In the logspace case, our results improve on previous results of Ta-Shma [STOC '13] by giving new space-efficient quantum algorithms that avoid intermediate measurements, as well as showing matching hardness results. Additionally, as a consequence we show that PreciseQMA, the version of QMA with exponentially small completeness-soundess gap, is equal to PSPACE. Thus, the problem of estimating the minimum eigenvalue of a local Hamiltonian to inverse exponential precision is PSPACE-complete, which we show holds even in the frustration-free case. Finally, we can use this characterization to give a provable setting in which the ability to prepare the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is more powerful than the ability to prepare PEPS states. Interestingly, by suitably changing the parameterization of either of these problems we can completely characterize the power of quantum computation with simultaneously bounded time and space."
109,1603.03948,2016,5,18,37,Universal fault-tolerant gates on concatenated stabilizer codes,Theodore J Yoder;Ryuji Takagi;Isaac L Chuang,"It is an oft-cited fact that no quantum code can support a set of fault-tolerant logical gates that is both universal and transversal. This no-go theorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality constructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however, is the possibility of non-transversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that work directly on small quantum codes. Here we demonstrate precisely the existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of non-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate error-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We detail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit and 7-qubit codes, and then proceed to generalize the approach. One remarkable result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across different stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable method of code switching."
110,1509.03239,2015,7,26,37,Doubled Color Codes,Sergey Bravyi;Andrew W Cross,"We show how to perform a fault-tolerant universal quantum computation in 2D architectures using only transversal unitary operators and local syndrome measurements. Our approach is based on a doubled version of the 2D color code. It enables a transversal implementation of all logical gates in the Clifford+T basis using the gauge fixing method proposed recently by Paetznick and Reichardt. The gauge fixing requires six-qubit parity measurements for Pauli operators supported on faces of the honeycomb lattice with two qubits per site. Doubled color codes are promising candidates for the experimental demonstration of logical gates since they do not require state distillation. Secondly, we propose a Maximum Likelihood algorithm for the error correction and gauge fixing tasks that enables a numerical simulation of logical circuits in the Clifford+T basis. The algorithm can be used in the online regime such that a new error syndrome is revealed at each time step. We estimate the average number of logical gates that can be implemented reliably for the smallest doubled color code and a toy noise model that includes depolarizing memory errors and syndrome measurement errors."
111,1502.06967,2015,4,6,37,Computing the Degenerate Ground Space of Gapped Spin Chains in Polynomial Time,Christopher T Chubb;Steven T Flammia,"Given a gapped Hamiltonian of a spin chain, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the degenerate ground space projector. The output is an orthonormal set of matrix product states that approximate the true ground space projector up to an inverse polynomial error in any Schatten norm, with a runtime exponential in the degeneracy. Our algorithm is an extension of the recent algorithm of Landau, Vazirani, and Vidick for the nondegenerate case, and it includes the recent improvements due to Huang. The main new idea is to incorporate the local distinguishability of ground states on the half-chain to ensure that the algorithm returns a complete set of global ground states."

We review and critique some recent proposals for improving the memory time by introducing long-range interactions among anyons, noting that instability with respect to small local perturbations of the Hamiltonian is a generic problem for such proposals. We also discuss some broader issues regarding the prospects for scalable quantum memory in two-dimensional systems."
113,1411.4028,2014,9,11,37,A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm,Edward Farhi;Jeffrey Goldstone;Sam Gutmann,"We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut."
114,1410.5124,2014,11,17,37,Resource optimization for fault-tolerant quantum computing,Adam Paetznick,"In this thesis we examine a variety of techniques for reducing the resources required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. First, we show how to simplify universal encoded computation by using only transversal gates and standard error correction procedures, circumventing existing no-go theorems. We then show how to simplify ancilla preparation, reducing the cost of error correction by more than a factor of four. Using this optimized ancilla preparation, we develop improved techniques for proving rigorous lower bounds on the noise threshold. Additional overhead can be incurred because quantum algorithms must be translated into sequences of gates that are actually available in the quantum computer. In particular, arbitrary single-qubit rotations must be decomposed into a discrete set of fault-tolerant gates. We find that by using a special class of non-deterministic circuits, the cost of decomposition can be reduced by as much as a factor of four over state-of-the-art techniques, which typically use deterministic circuits. Finally, we examine global optimization of fault-tolerant quantum circuits under physical connectivity constraints. We adapt techniques from VLSI in order to minimize time and space usage for computations in the surface code, and we develop a software prototype to demonstrate the potential savings."
115,1409.0260,2014,10,21,37,A multiprover interactive proof system for the local Hamiltonian problem,Joseph F Fitzsimons;Thomas Vidick,"We give a quantum interactive proof system for the local Hamiltonian problem on n qubits in which (i) the verifier has a single round of interaction with five entangled provers, (ii) the verifier sends a classical message on O(log n) bits to each prover, who reply with a constant number of qubits, and (iii) completeness and soundness are separated by an inverse polynomial in n. As the same class of proof systems, without entanglement between the provers, is included in QCMA, our result provides the first indication that quantum multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers may be strictly more powerful than unentangled-prover interactive proof systems. A distinguishing feature of our protocol is that the completeness property requires honest provers to share a large entangled state, obtained as the encoding of the ground state of the local Hamiltonian via an error-correcting code. Our result can be interpreted as a first step towards a multiprover variant of the quantum PCP conjecture."
116,1406.2170,2014,9,2,37,How to efficiently select an arbitrary Clifford group element,Robert Koenig;John A Smolin,"We give an algorithm which produces a unique element of the Clifford group C_n on n qubits from an integer 0\le i < |C_n| (the number of elements in the group). The algorithm involves O(n^3) operations. It is a variant of the subgroup algorithm by Diaconis and Shahshahani which is commonly applied to compact Lie groups. We provide an adaption for the symplectic group Sp(2n,F_2) which provides, in addition to a canonical mapping from the integers to group elements g, a factorization of g into a sequence of at most 4n symplectic transvections. The algorithm can be used to efficiently select randomelements of C_n which is often useful in quantum information theory and quantum computation. We also give an algorithm for the inverse map, indexing a group element in time O(n^3)."

Working in a common model of fault-tolerance, I show that in the asymptotic limit of large circuits, the ratio of physical qubits to logical qubits can be a constant. The construction makes use of quantum low-density parity check codes, and the asymptotic overhead of the protocol is equal to that of the family of quantum error-correcting codes underlying the fault-tolerant protocol."
118,1611.08571,2016,10,12,36,On preparing ground states of gapped Hamiltonians: An efficient Quantum Lovász Local Lemma,András Gilyén;Or Sattath,"A frustration-free local Hamiltonian has the property that its ground state minimises the energy of all local terms simultaneously. In general, even deciding whether a Hamiltonian is frustration-free is a hard task, as it is closely related to the QMA1-complete quantum satisfiability problem (QSAT) -- the quantum analogue of SAT, which is the archetypal NP-complete problem in classical computer science. This connection shows that the frustration-free property is not only relevant to physics but also to computer science. The Quantum Lovász Local Lemma (QLLL) provides a sufficient condition for frustration-freeness. A natural question is whether there is an efficient way to prepare a frustration-free state under the conditions of the QLLL. Previous results showed that the answer is positive if all local terms commute. In this work we improve on the previous constructive results by designing an algorithm that works efficiently for non-commuting terms as well, assuming that the system is ""uniformly"" gapped, by which we mean that the system and all its subsystems have an inverse polynomial energy gap. Also, our analysis works under the most general condition for the QLLL, known as Shearer's bound. Similarly to the previous results, our algorithm has the charming feature that it uses only local measurement operations corresponding to the local Hamiltonian terms."
119,1610.03133,2016,11,28,36,Compression of Quantum Multi-Prover Interactive Proofs,Zhengfeng Ji,"We present a protocol that transforms any quantum multi-prover interactive proof into a nonlocal game in which questions consist of logarithmic number of bits and answers of constant number of bits. As a corollary, this proves that the promise problem corresponding to the approximation of the nonlocal value to inverse polynomial accuracy is complete for QMIP*, and therefore NEXP-hard. This establishes that nonlocal games are provably harder than classical games without any complexity theory assumptions. Our result also indicates that gap amplification for nonlocal games may be impossible in general and provides a negative evidence for the possibility of the gap amplification approach to the multi-prover variant of the quantum PCP conjecture."

While the surface code is believed to have a high threshold, the numerical simulations used to establish this threshold are based on simplified noise models. We present a tensor-network algorithm for simulating error correction with the surface code under arbitrary local noise. Our simulation is exact within statistical fluctuations and we use it to study the threshold and the sub-threshold behaviour of the amplitude-damping and systematic rotation channels. We also compare these exact results to those obtained by making standard approximations to the noise models."
121,1606.06301,2016,9,23,36,Approximating local observables on projected entangled pair states,Martin Schwarz;Oliver Buerschaper;Jens Eisert,"Tensor network states are for good reasons believed to capture ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians arising in the condensed matter context, states which are in turn expected to satisfy an entanglement area law. However, the computational hardness of contracting projected entangled pair states in two and higher dimensional systems is often seen as a significant obstacle when devising higher-dimensional variants of the density-matrix renormalisation group method. In this work, we show that for those projected entangled pair states that are expected to provide good approximations of such ground states of local Hamiltonians, one can compute local expectation values in quasi-polynomial time. We therefore provide a complexity-theoretic justification of why state-of-the-art numerical tools work so well in practice. We comment on how the transfer operators of such projected entangled pair states have a gap and discuss notions of local topological quantum order. We finally turn to the computation of local expectation values on quantum computers, providing a meaningful application for a small-scale quantum computer."
122,1606.05061,2016,7,25,36,Perfect Embezzlement of Entanglement,Richard Cleve;Li Liu;Vern I Paulsen,"Van Dam and Hayden introduced a concept commonly referred to as embezzlement, where, for any entangled quantum state $\phi$, there is an entangled catalyst state $\psi$, from which a high fidelity approximation of $\phi \otimes \psi$ can be produced using only local operations. We investigate a version of this where the embezzlement is perfect (i.e., the fidelity is 1). We prove that perfect embezzlement is impossible in a tensor product framework, even with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and infinite entanglement entropy. Then we prove that perfect embezzlement is possible in a commuting operator framework. We prove this using the theory of C*-algebras and we also provide an explicit construction. Next, we apply our results to analyze perfect versions of a nonlocal game introduced by Regev and Vidick. Finally, we analyze the structure of perfect embezzlement protocols in the commuting operator model, showing that they require infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces."
123,1606.02734,2016,6,22,36,Universal Quantum Emulator,Iman Marvian;Seth Lloyd,"We propose a quantum algorithm that emulates the action of an unknown unitary transformation on a given input state, using multiple copies of some unknown sample input states of the unitary and their corresponding output states. The algorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be emulated, or the sample input states. To emulate the action of the unknown unitary, the new input state is coupled to the given sample input-output pairs in a coherent fashion. Remarkably, the runtime of the algorithm is logarithmic in D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d, the dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore, the sample complexity of the algorithm, i.e. the total number of copies of the sample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm, is independent of D, and polynomial in d. In contrast, the runtime and the sample complexity of incoherent methods, i.e. methods that use tomography, are both linear in D. The algorithm is blind, in the sense that at the end it does not learn anything about the given samples, or the emulated unitary. This algorithm can be used as a subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation."
124,1604.01979,2016,6,10,36,Quantum Yang-Mills theory: an overview of a programme,Ashley Milsted;Tobias J Osborne,"We present an overview of a programme to understand the low-energy physics of quantum Yang-Mills theory from a quantum-information perspective. Our setting is that of the hamiltonian formulation of pure Yang-Mills theory in the temporal gauge on the lattice. Firstly, inspired by recent constructions for $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ lattice gauge theory, in particular, Kitaev's toric code, we describe the gauge-invariant sector of hilbert space by introducing a primitive quantum gate: the quantum parallel transporter. We then develop a nonabelian generalisation of laplace interpolation to present an ansatz for the ground state of pure Yang-Mills theory which interpolates between the weak- and strong-coupling RG fixed points. The resulting state acquires the structure of a tensor network, namely, a multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz, and allows for the efficient computation of local observables and Wilson loops. Various refinements of the tensor network are discussed leading to several generalisations. Finally, the continuum limit of our ansatz as the lattice regulator is removed is then described. This paper is intended as an abstract for an ongoing programme: there are still many open problems."

Our review is a blend of a rather exhaustive review, combined with more detailed examples -- coming from research projects in which the authors were involved. We focus on two main topics, random quantum states and random quantum channels. We present results related to entropic quantities, entanglement of typical states, entanglement thresholds, the output set of quantum channels, and violations of the minimum output entropy of random channels."
126,1509.04255,2015,4,8,36,Stacked codes: universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in a two-dimensional layout,Tomas Jochym-O'Connor;Stephen D Bartlett,"We introduce a class of 3D color codes, which we call stacked codes, together with a fault-tolerant transformation that will map logical qubits encoded in two-dimensional (2D) color codes into stacked codes and back. The stacked code allows for the transversal implementation of a non-Clifford $\pi/8$ logical gate, which when combined with the logical Clifford gates that are transversal in the 2D color code give a gate set which is both fault-tolerant and universal without requiring nonstabilizer magic states. We then show that the layers forming the stacked code can be unfolded and arranged in a 2D layout. As only Clifford gates can be implemented transversally for 2D topological stabilizer codes, a non-local operation must be incorporated in order to allow for this transversal application of a non-Clifford gate. Our code achieves this operation through the transformation from a 2D color code to the unfolded stacked code induced by measuring only geometrically local stabilizers and gauge operators within the bulk of 2D color codes together with a nonlocal operator that has support on a one-dimensional boundary between such 2D codes. We believe that this proposed method to implement the non-local operation is a realistic one for 2D stabilizer layouts and would be beneficial in avoiding the large overheads caused by magic state distillation."
127,1508.01797,2015,9,16,36,Sample-optimal tomography of quantum states,Jeongwan Haah;Aram W Harrow;Zhengfeng Ji;Xiaodi Wu;Nengkun Yu,"It is a fundamental problem to decide how many copies of an unknown mixed quantum state are necessary and sufficient to determine the state. Previously, it was known only that estimating states to error $\epsilon$ in trace distance required $O(dr^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies for a $d$-dimensional density matrix of rank $r$. Here, we give a theoretical measurement scheme (POVM) that requires $O( (dr/ \delta ) \ln (d/\delta) )$ copies of $\rho$ to error $\delta$ in infidelity, and a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. This implies $O( (dr / \epsilon^2) \ln (d/\epsilon) )$ copies suffice to achieve error $\epsilon$ in trace distance. For fixed $d$, our measurement can be implemented on a quantum computer in time polynomial in $n$."
128,1505.04661,2015,9,15,36,Recoverability in quantum information theory,Mark M Wilde,"The fact that the quantum relative entropy is non-increasing with respect to quantum physical evolutions lies at the core of many optimality theorems in quantum information theory and has applications in other areas of physics. In this work, we establish improvements of this entropy inequality in the form of physically meaningful remainder terms. One of the main results can be summarized informally as follows: if the decrease in quantum relative entropy between two quantum states after a quantum physical evolution is relatively small, then it is possible to perform a recovery operation, such that one can perfectly recover one state while approximately recovering the other. This can be interpreted as quantifying how well one can reverse a quantum physical evolution. Our proof method is elementary, relying on the method of complex interpolation, basic linear algebra, and the recently introduced Renyi generalization of a relative entropy difference. The theorem has a number of applications in quantum information theory, which have to do with providing physically meaningful improvements to many known entropy inequalities."
129,1504.04350,2015,8,11,36,A framework for exact synthesis,Vadym Kliuchnikov;Jon Yard,"Exact synthesis is a tool used in algorithms for approximating an arbitrary qubit unitary with a sequence of quantum gates from some finite set. These approximation algorithms find asymptotically optimal approximations in probabilistic polynomial time, in some cases even finding the optimal solution in probabilistic polynomial time given access to an oracle for factoring integers. In this paper, we present a common mathematical structure underlying all results related to the exact synthesis of qubit unitaries known to date, including Clifford+T, Clifford-cyclotomic and V-basis gate sets, as well as gates sets induced by the braiding of Fibonacci anyons in topological quantum computing. The framework presented here also provides a means to answer questions related to the exact synthesis of unitaries for wide classes of other gate sets, such as Clifford+T+V and SU(2) level k anyons."
130,1411.4921,2014,5,19,36,"Quantum Conditional Mutual Information, Reconstructed States, and State Redistribution",Fernando G S L Brandão;Aram W Harrow;Jonathan Oppenheim;Sergii Strelchuk,"We give two strengthenings of an inequality for the quantum conditional mutual information of a tripartite quantum state recently proved by Fawzi and Renner, connecting it with the ability to reconstruct the state from its bipartite reductions. Namely we show that the conditional mutual information is an upper bound on the regularised relative entropy distance between the quantum state and its reconstructed version. It is also an upper bound for the measured relative entropy distance of the state to its reconstructed version. The main ingredient of the proof is the fact that the conditional mutual information is the optimal quantum communication rate in the task of state redistribution."
131,1409.3208,2014,4,17,36,Normalizer circuits and a Gottesman-Knill theorem for infinite-dimensional systems,Juan Bermejo-Vega;Cedric Yen-Yu Lin;Maarten Van den Nest,"$\textit{Normalizer circuits}$ [1,2] are generalized Clifford circuits that act on arbitrary finite-dimensional systems $\mathcal{H}_{d_1}\otimes ... \otimes \mathcal{H}_{d_n}$ with a standard basis labeled by the elements of a finite Abelian group $G=\mathbb{Z}_{d_1}\times... \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n}$. Normalizer gates implement operations associated with the group $G$ and can be of three types: quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism gates and quadratic phase gates. In this work, we extend the normalizer formalism [1,2] to infinite dimensions, by allowing normalizer gates to act on systems of the form $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}^{\otimes a}$: each factor $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}$ has a standard basis labeled by $\textit{integers}$ $\mathbb{Z}$, and a Fourier basis labeled by $\textit{angles}$, elements of the circle group $\mathbb{T}$. Normalizer circuits become hybrid quantum circuits acting both on continuous- and discrete-variable systems. We show that infinite-dimensional normalizer circuits can be efficiently simulated classically with a generalized $\textit{stabilizer formalism}$ for Hilbert spaces associated with groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}^a\times \mathbb{T}^b \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_1}\times...\times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n}$. We develop new techniques to track stabilizer-groups based on normal forms for group automorphisms and quadratic functions. We use our normal forms to reduce the problem of simulating normalizer circuits to that of finding general solutions of systems of mixed real-integer linear equations [3] and exploit this fact to devise a robust simulation algorithm: the latter remains efficient even in pathological cases where stabilizer groups become infinite, uncountable and non-compact. The techniques developed in this paper might find applications in the study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconducting qubits [4,5]."

134,1303.2849,2013,3,3,35,Bell nonlocality,Nicolas Brunner;Daniel Cavalcanti;Stefano Pironio;Valerio Scarani;Stephanie Wehner,"Bell's 1964 theorem, which states that the predictions of quantum theory cannot be accounted for by any local theory, represents one of the most profound developments in the foundations of physics. In the last two decades, Bell's theorem has been a central theme of research from a variety of perspectives, mainly motivated by quantum information science, where the nonlocality of quantum theory underpins many of the advantages afforded by a quantum processing of information. The focus of this review is to a large extent oriented by these later developments. We review the main concepts and tools which have been developed to describe and study the nonlocality of quantum theory, and which have raised this topic to the status of a full sub-field of quantum information science."
135,1612.02689,2016,1,5,35,Shorter gate sequences for quantum computing by mixing unitaries,Earl T Campbell,"Fault-tolerant quantum computers compose elements of a discrete gate set in order to approximate a target unitary. The problem of minimising the number of gates is known as gate-synthesis. The approximation error is a form of coherent noise, which can be significantly more damaging than comparable incoherent noise. We show how mixing over different gate sequences can convert this coherent noise into an incoherent form. As measured by diamond distance, the post-mixing noise is quadratically smaller than before mixing, with no additional resource cost. Equivalently, we can use a shorter gate sequence to achieve the same precision as unitary gate-synthesis, with a factor 1/2 reduction for a broad class of problems."
136,1610.09619,2016,3,13,35,Fast-forwarding of Hamiltonians and Exponentially Precise Measurements,Yosi Atia;Dorit Aharonov,"In the early days of quantum mechanics, it was believed that the time energy uncertainty principle (TEUP) bounds the efficiency of energy measurements, relating the duration ($\Delta t$) of the measurement, and its accuracy error ($\Delta E$) by $\Delta t\Delta E \ge$ 1/2. In 1961 Y. Aharonov and Bohm gave a counterexample, whereas Aharonov, Massar and Popescu [2002] showed that under certain conditions the principle holds. Can we classify when and to what extent the TEUP is violated? Our main theorem asserts that such violations are in one to one correspondence with the ability to ""fast forward"" the associated Hamiltonian, namely, to simulate its evolution for time $t$ using much less than $t$ quantum gates. This intriguingly links precision measurements with quantum algorithms. Our theorem is stated in terms of a modified TEUP, which we call the computational TEUP (cTEUP). In this principle the time duration ($\Delta t$) is replaced by the number of quantum gates required to perform the measurement, and we argue why this is more suitable to study if one is to understand the totality of physical resources required to perform an accurate measurement. The inspiration for this result is a family of Hamiltonians we construct, based on Shor's algorithm, which exponentially violate the cTEUP (and the TEUP), thus allowing exponential fast forwarding. We further show that commuting local Hamiltonians and quadratic Hamiltonians of fermions (e.g., Anderson localization model), can be fast forwarded. The work raises the question of finding a physical criterion for fast forwarding, in particular, can many body localization systems be fast forwarded? We rule out a general fast-forwarding method for all physically realizable Hamiltonians (unless BQP=PSPACE). Connections to quantum metrology and to Susskind's complexification of a wormhole's length are discussed."
137,1610.06169,2016,12,9,35,Limits on the storage of quantum information in a volume of space,Steven T Flammia;Jeongwan Haah;Michael J Kastoryano;Isaac H Kim,"We study the fundamental limits on the reliable storage of quantum information in lattices of qubits by deriving tradeoff bounds for approximate quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a notion of local approximate correctability and code distance, and give a number of equivalent formulations thereof, generalizing various exact error-correction criteria. Our tradeoff bounds relate the number of physical qubits $n$, the number of encoded qubits $k$, the code distance $d$, the accuracy parameter $\delta$ that quantifies how well the erasure channel can be reversed, and the locality parameter $\ell$ that specifies the length scale at which the recovery operation can be done. In a regime where the recovery is successful to accuracy $\epsilon$ that is exponentially small in $\ell$, which is the case for perturbations of local commuting projector codes, our bound reads $kd^{\frac{2}{D-1}} \le O\bigl(n (\log n)^{\frac{2D}{D-1}} \bigr)$ for codes on $D$-dimensional lattices of Euclidean metric. We also find that the code distance of any local approximate code cannot exceed $O\bigl(\ell n^{(D-1)/D}\bigr)$ if $\delta \le O(\ell n^{-1/D})$. As a corollary of our formulation of correctability in terms of logical operator avoidance, we show that the code distance $d$ and the size $\tilde d$ of a minimal region that can support all approximate logical operators satisfies $\tilde d d^{\frac{1}{D-1}}\le O\bigl( n \ell^{\frac{D}{D-1}} \bigr)$, where the logical operators are accurate up to $O\bigl( ( n \delta / d )^{1/2}\bigr)$ in operator norm. Finally, we prove that for two-dimensional systems if logical operators can be approximated by operators supported on constant-width flexible strings, then the dimension of the code space must be bounded. This supports one of the assumptions of algebraic anyon theories, that there exist only finitely many anyon types."
138,1609.07021,2016,11,22,35,Efficient unitary designs with nearly time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics,Yoshifumi Nakata;Christoph Hirche;Masato Koashi;Andreas Winter,"We provide new constructions of unitary $t$-designs for general $t$ on one qudit and $N$ qubits, and propose a design Hamiltonian, a random Hamiltonian of which dynamics always forms a unitary design after a threshold time, as a basic framework to investigate randomising time evolution in quantum many-body systems. The new constructions are based on recently proposed schemes of repeating random unitaires diagonal in mutually unbiased bases. We first show that, if a pair of the bases satisfies a certain condition, the process on one qudit approximately forms a unitary $t$-design after $O(t)$ repetitions. We then construct quantum circuits on $N$ qubits that achieve unitary $t$-designs for $t = o(N^{1/2})$ using $O(t N^2)$ gates, improving the previous result using $O(t^{10}N^2)$ gates in terms of $t$. Based on these results, we present a design Hamiltonian with periodically changing two-local spin-glass-type interactions, leading to fast and relatively natural realisations of unitary designs in complex many-body systems."
139,1607.03901,2016,10,20,35,The Ryu-Takayanagi Formula from Quantum Error Correction,Daniel Harlow,"I argue that a version of the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds in any quantum error-correcting code. I present this result as a series of theorems of increasing generality, with the final statement expressed in the language of operator-algebra quantum error correction. In AdS/CFT this gives a ""purely boundary"" interpretation of the formula. I also extend a recent theorem, which established entanglement-wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT, when interpreted as a subsystem code, to the more general, and I argue more physical, case of subalgebra codes. For completeness, I include a self-contained presentation of the theory of von Neumann algebras on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as well as the algebraic definition of entropy. The results confirm a close relationship between bulk gauge transformations, edge-modes/soft-hair on black holes, and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. They also suggest a new perspective on the homology constraint, which basically is to get rid of it in a way that preserves the validity of the formula, but which removes any tension with the linearity of quantum mechanics. Moreover they suggest a boundary interpretation of the ""bit threads"" recently introduced by Freedman and Headrick."
140,1604.07452,2016,8,19,35,Quantum circuit dynamics via path integrals: Is there a classical action for discrete-time paths?,Mark D Penney;Dax Enshan Koh;Robert W Spekkens,"It is straightforward to give a sum-over-paths expression for the transition amplitudes of a quantum circuit as long as the gates in the circuit are balanced, where to be balanced is to have all nonzero transition amplitudes of equal magnitude. Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits, the relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration space can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for continuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum circuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are continuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These types of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that serve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the phase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate in the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space and to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two copies of the configuration space. For discrete systems, the latter association is achieved using tools from algebraic geometry. Finally, we show that if the action functional for a discrete-time path through a sequence of gates is defined using the sum of the corresponding generating functions, then it yields the correct relative phases for the path-sum expression. These results are likely to be relevant for quantizing physical theories where time is fundamentally discrete, characterizing the classical limit of discrete-time quantum dynamics, and proving complexity results for quantum circuits."
141,1604.02189,2016,7,15,35,Should Entanglement Measures be Monogamous or Faithful?,Cécilia Lancien;Sara Di Martino;Marcus Huber;Marco Piani;Gerardo Adesso;Andreas Winter,"""Is entanglement monogamous?"" asks the title of a popular article [B. Terhal, IBM J. Res. Dev. 48, 71 (2004)], celebrating C. H. Bennett's legacy on quantum information theory. While the answer is affirmative in the qualitative sense, the situation is less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we formalize what it takes for a bipartite measure of entanglement to obey a general quantitative monogamy relation on all quantum states. We then prove that an important class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this general sense of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In particular, we show that every additive and suitably normalized entanglement measure cannot satisfy any nontrivial general monogamy relation while at the same time faithfully capturing the geometric entanglement structure of the fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy of such entanglement measures can be recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples."
142,1510.06789,2015,6,17,35,Quantum proofs can be verified using only single qubit measurements,Tomoyuki Morimae;Daniel Nagaj;Norbert Schuch,"QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) is the class of problems which, though potentially hard to solve, have a quantum solution which can be verified efficiently using a quantum computer. It thus forms a natural quantum version of the classical complexity class NP (and its probabilistic variant MA, Merlin-Arthur games), where the verifier has only classical computational resources. In this paper, we study what happens when we restrict the quantum resources of the verifier to the bare minimum: individual measurements on single qubits received as they come, one-by-one. We find that despite this grave restriction, it is still possible to soundly verify any problem in QMA for the verifier with the minimum quantum resources possible, without using any quantum memory or multiqubit operations. We provide two independent proofs of this fact, based on measurement based quantum computation and the local Hamiltonian problem, respectively. The former construction also applies to QMA$_1$, i.e., QMA with one-sided error."

We consider spin Hamiltonians for which we have an upper bound on the number of terms in which each spin participates, and find extensive bounds for the operator norm and ground-state energy of such Hamiltonians under this constraint. In each case the bound is achieved by a product state which can be found efficiently using a classical algorithm."

145,1503.02065,2015,7,6,35,Unfolding the color code,Aleksander Kubica;Beni Yoshida;Fernando Pastawski,"The topological color code and the toric code are two leading candidates for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we show that the color code on a $d$-dimensional closed manifold is equivalent to multiple decoupled copies of the $d$-dimensional toric code up to local unitary transformations and adding or removing ancilla qubits. Our result not only generalizes the proven equivalence for $d=2$, but also provides an explicit recipe of how to decouple independent components of the color code, highlighting the importance of colorability in the construction of the code. Moreover, for the $d$-dimensional color code with $d+1$ boundaries of $d+1$ distinct colors, we find that the code is equivalent to multiple copies of the $d$-dimensional toric code which are attached along a $(d-1)$-dimensional boundary. In particular, for $d=2$, we show that the (triangular) color code with boundaries is equivalent to the (folded) toric code with boundaries. We also find that the $d$-dimensional toric code admits logical non-Pauli gates from the $d$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy, and thus saturates the bound by Bravyi and König. In particular, we show that the $d$-qubit control-$Z$ logical gate can be fault-tolerantly implemented on the stack of $d$ copies of the toric code by a local unitary transformation."
146,1502.05630,2015,5,13,35,Positivity of linear maps under tensor powers,Alexander Müller-Hermes;David Reeb;Michael M Wolf,"We investigate linear maps between matrix algebras that remain positive under tensor powers, i.e., under tensoring with $n$ copies of themselves. Completely positive and completely co-positive maps are trivial examples of this kind. We show that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exist non-trivial maps with this property and that for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces there is no non-trivial map for which this holds for all $n$. For higher dimensions we reduce the existence question of such non-trivial ""tensor-stable positive maps"" to a one-parameter family of maps and show that an affirmative answer would imply the existence of NPPT bound entanglement. As an application we show that any tensor-stable positive map that is not completely positive yields an upper bound on the quantum channel capacity, which for the transposition map gives the well-known cb-norm bound. We furthermore show that the latter is an upper bound even for the LOCC-assisted quantum capacity, and that moreover it is a strong converse rate for this task."
147,1406.5955,2014,3,27,35,Simple universal models capture all classical spin physics,Gemma De las Cuevas;Toby S Cubitt,"Spin models are used in many studies of complex systems---be it condensed matter physics, neural networks, or economics---as they exhibit rich macroscopic behaviour despite their microscopic simplicity. Here we prove that all the physics of every classical spin model is reproduced in the low-energy sector of certain `universal models'. This means that (i) the low energy spectrum of the universal model reproduces the entire spectrum of the original model to any desired precision, (ii) the corresponding spin configurations of the original model are also reproduced in the universal model, (iii) the partition function is approximated to any desired precision, and (iv) the overhead in terms of number of spins and interactions is at most polynomial. This holds for classical models with discrete or continuous degrees of freedom. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a spin model to be universal, and show that one of the simplest and most widely studied spin models, the 2D Ising model with fields, is universal."
148,1406.4920,2014,3,9,35,The Trotter Step Size Required for Accurate Quantum Simulation of Quantum Chemistry,David Poulin;Matthew B Hastings;Dave Wecker;Nathan Wiebe;Andrew C Doherty;Matthias Troyer,"The simulation of molecules is a widely anticipated application of quantum computers. However, recent studies \citeWBCH13a,HWBT14a have cast a shadow on this hope by revealing that the complexity in gate count of such simulations increases with the number of spin orbitals $N$ as $N^8$, which becomes prohibitive even for molecules of modest size $N\sim 100$. This study was partly based on a scaling analysis of the Trotter step required for an ensemble of random artificial molecules. Here, we revisit this analysis and find instead that the scaling is closer to $N^6$ in worst case for real model molecules we have studied, indicating that the random ensemble fails to accurately capture the statistical properties of real-world molecules. Actual scaling may be significantly better than this due to averaging effects. We then present an alternative simulation scheme and show that it can sometimes outperform existing schemes, but that this possibility depends crucially on the details of the simulated molecule. We obtain further improvements using a version of the coalescing scheme of \citeWBCH13a; this scheme is based on using different Trotter steps for different terms. The method we use to bound the complexity of simulating a given molecule is efficient, in contrast to the approach of \citeWBCH13a,HWBT14a which relied on exponentially costly classical exact simulation."
149,1404.7115,2014,2,20,35,Quantum Algorithms for Fermionic Quantum Field Theories,Stephen P Jordan;Keith S M Lee;John Preskill,"Extending previous work on scalar field theories, we develop a quantum algorithm to compute relativistic scattering amplitudes in fermionic field theories, exemplified by the massive Gross-Neveu model, a theory in two spacetime dimensions with quartic interactions. The algorithm introduces new techniques to meet the additional challenges posed by the characteristics of fermionic fields, and its run time is polynomial in the desired precision and the energy. Thus, it constitutes further progress towards an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the Standard Model of particle physics."
150,1511.04857,2015,6,24,34,Entropic Uncertainty Relations and their Applications,Patrick J Coles;Mario Berta;Marco Tomamichel;Stephanie Wehner,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle forms a fundamental element of quantum mechanics. Uncertainty relations in terms of entropies were initially proposed to deal with conceptual shortcomings in the original formulation of the uncertainty principle, and hence play an important role in quantum foundations. More recently, entropic uncertainty relations have emerged as the central ingredient in the security analysis of almost all quantum cryptographic protocols, ranging from quantum key distribution to two-party quantum cryptography. This review surveys entropic uncertainty relations that capture Heisenberg's idea that the results of incompatible measurements are impossible to predict, covering both finite- and infinite-dimensional measurements. These ideas are then extended to incorporate quantum correlations between the observed object and its environment, allowing for a variety of recent, more general formulations of the uncertainty principle. Finally various applications are discussed, ranging from entanglement witnessing to wave-particle duality to quantum cryptography."
151,1611.06946,2016,6,20,34,Experimental demonstration of quantum fault tolerance,N M Linke;Mauricio Gutiérrez;K A Landsman;C Figgatt;S Debnath;Kenneth R Brown;Christopher Monroe,"Quantum computers will eventually reach a size at which quantum error correction (QEC) becomes imperative. In order to make quantum information robust to errors introduced by qubit imperfections and flawed control operations, QEC protocols encode a logical qubit in multiple physical qubits. This redundancy allows the extraction of error syndromes and the subsequent correction or detection of errors without destroying the logical state itself through direct measurement. While several experiments have shown a reduction of high intrinsic or artificially introduced errors in logical qubits, fault-tolerant encoding of a logical qubit has never been demonstrated. Here we show the encoding and syndrome measurement of a fault-tolerant logical qubit via an error detection protocol on four physical qubits, represented by trapped atomic ions. This demonstrates for the first time the robustness of a fault-tolerant qubit to imperfections in the very operations used to encode it. This advantage persists in the face of large added error rates and experimental calibration errors."
152,1608.05089,2016,4,29,34,Quantum Codes from High-Dimensional Manifolds,Matthew B Hastings,"We construct toric codes on various high-dimensional manifolds. Assuming a conjecture in geometry we find families of quantum CSS stabilizer codes on $N$ qubits with logarithmic weight stabilizers and distance $N^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$. The conjecture is that there is a constant $C>0$ such that for any $n$-dimensional torus ${\mathbb T}^n={\mathbb R}^n/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is a lattice, the least volume unoriented $n/2$-dimensional surface (using the Euclidean metric) representing nontrivial homology has volume at least $C^n$ times the volume of the least volume $n/2$-dimensional hyperplane representing nontrivial homology; in fact, it would suffice to have this result for $\Lambda$ an integral lattice with the surface restricted to faces of a cubulation by unit hypercubes. The main technical result is an estimate of Rankin invariants\citerankin for certain random lattices, showing that in a certain sense they are optimal. Additionally, we construct codes with square-root distance, logarithmic weight stabilizers, and inverse polylogarithmic soundness factor (considered as quantum locally testable codes\citeqltc). We also provide an short, alternative proof that the shortest vector in the exterior power of a lattice may be non-split\citecoulangeon."
153,1608.00263,2016,11,17,34,Characterizing Quantum Supremacy in Near-Term Devices,Sergio Boixo;Sergei V Isakov;Vadim N Smelyanskiy;Ryan Babbush;Nan Ding;Zhang Jiang;John M Martinis;Hartmut Neven,"A critical question for the field of quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test."
154,1511.02235,2015,8,2,34,"NAND-Trees, Average Choice Complexity, and Effective Resistance",Stacey Jeffery;Shelby Kimmel,"We show that the quantum query complexity of evaluating NAND-tree instances with average choice complexity at most $W$ is $O(W)$, where average choice complexity is a measure of the difficulty of winning the associated two-player game. This generalizes a superpolynomial speedup over classical query complexity due to Zhan et al. [Zhan et al., ITCS 2012, 249-265]. We further show that the player with a winning strategy for the two-player game associated with the NAND-tree can win the game with an expected $\widetilde{O}(N^{1/4}\sqrt{{\cal C}(x)})$ quantum queries against a random opponent, where ${\cal C }(x)$ is the average choice complexity of the instance. This gives an improvement over the query complexity of the naive strategy, which costs $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries. The results rely on a connection between NAND-tree evaluation and $st$-connectivity problems on certain graphs, and span programs for $st$-connectivity problems. Our results follow from relating average choice complexity to the effective resistance of these graphs, which itself corresponds to the span program witness size."
155,1509.01278,2015,11,10,34,Adiabatic and Hamiltonian computing on a 2D lattice with simple 2-qubit interactions,Seth Lloyd;Barbara M Terhal,"We show how to perform universal Hamiltonian and adiabatic computing using a time-independent Hamiltonian on a 2D grid describing a system of hopping particles which string together and interact to perform the computation. In this construction, the movement of one particle is controlled by the presence or absence of other particles, an effective quantum field effect transistor that allows the construction of controlled-NOT and controlled-rotation gates. The construction translates into a model for universal quantum computation with time-independent 2-qubit ZZ and XX+YY interactions on an (almost) planar grid. The effective Hamiltonian is arrived at by a single use of first-order perturbation theory avoiding the use of perturbation gadgets. The dynamics and spectral properties of the effective Hamiltonian can be fully determined as it corresponds to a particular realization of a mapping between a quantum circuit and a Hamiltonian called the space-time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction. Because of the simple interactions required, and because no higher-order perturbation gadgets are employed, our construction is potentially realizable using superconducting or other solid-state qubits."
156,1508.01907,2015,9,7,34,Efficient quantum tomography,Ryan O'Donnell;John Wright,"In the quantum state tomography problem, one wishes to estimate an unknown $d$-dimensional mixed quantum state $\rho$, given few copies. We show that $O(d/\epsilon)$ copies suffice to obtain an estimate $\hat{\rho}$ that satisfies $\|\hat{\rho} - \rho\|_F^2 \leq \epsilon$ (with high probability). An immediate consequence is that $O(\mathrm{rank}(\rho) \cdot d/\epsilon^2) \leq O(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies suffice to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate in the standard trace distance. This improves on the best known prior result of $O(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ copies for full tomography, and even on the best known prior result of $O(d^2\log(d/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2)$ copies for spectrum estimation. Our result is the first to show that nontrivial tomography can be obtained using a number of copies that is just linear in the dimension. Next, we generalize these results to show that one can perform efficient principal component analysis on $\rho$. Our main result is that $O(k d/\epsilon^2)$ copies suffice to output a rank-$k$ approximation $\hat{\rho}$ whose trace distance error is at most $\epsilon$ more than that of the best rank-$k$ approximator to $\rho$. This subsumes our above trace distance tomography result and generalizes it to the case when $\rho$ is not guaranteed to be of low rank. A key part of the proof is the analogous generalization of our spectrum-learning results: we show that the largest $k$ eigenvalues of $\rho$ can be estimated to trace-distance error $\epsilon$ using $O(k^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies. In turn, this result relies on a new coupling theorem concerning the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm that should be of independent combinatorial interest."

The algorithm runs in time linear in the number of qubits, which makes its performance the strongest to date for linear-time decoding of quantum codes. The algorithm relies on expanding properties, not of the quantum code's factor graph directly, but of the factor graph of the original classical code it is constructed from."

We cover topics such as equilibration and thermalisation in pure state statistical mechanics, the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis, the equivalence of ensembles, non-equilibration dynamics following global and local quenches as well as ramps. We also address initial state independence, absence of thermalisation, and many-body localisation. We elucidate the role played by key concepts for these phenomena, such as Lieb-Robinson bounds, entanglement growth, typicality arguments, quantum maximum entropy principles and the generalised Gibbs ensembles, and quantum (non-)integrability. We put emphasis on rigorous approaches and present the most important results in a unified language."
159,1409.3182,2014,9,11,34,Ground state connectivity of local Hamiltonians,Sevag Gharibian;Jamie Sikora,"The study of ground state energies of local Hamiltonians has played a fundamental role in quantum complexity theory. In this paper, we take a new direction by introducing the physically motivated notion of ""ground state connectivity"" of local Hamiltonians, which captures problems in areas ranging from quantum stabilizer codes to quantum memories. We show that determining how ""connected"" the ground space of a local Hamiltonian is can range from QCMA-complete to NEXP-complete. As a result, we obtain a natural QCMA-complete problem, a goal which has generally proven difficult since the conception of QCMA over a decade ago. Our proofs rely on a new technical tool, the Traversal Lemma, which analyzes the Hilbert space a local unitary evolution must traverse under certain conditions. We show that this lemma is tight up to a polynomial factor with respect to the length of the unitary evolution in question."
160,1312.1414,2013,12,6,34,Exponential improvement in precision for simulating sparse Hamiltonians,Dominic W Berry;Andrew M Childs;Richard Cleve;Robin Kothari;Rolando D Somma,"We provide a quantum algorithm for simulating the dynamics of sparse Hamiltonians with complexity sublogarithmic in the inverse error, an exponential improvement over previous methods. Specifically, we show that a $d$-sparse Hamiltonian $H$ acting on $n$ qubits can be simulated for time $t$ with precision $\epsilon$ using $O\big(\tau \frac{\log(\tau/\epsilon)}{\log\log(\tau/\epsilon)}\big)$ queries and $O\big(\tau \frac{\log^2(\tau/\epsilon)}{\log\log(\tau/\epsilon)}n\big)$ additional 2-qubit gates, where $\tau = d^2 \|{H}\|_{\max} t$. Unlike previous approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous- and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very small error. We also simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a new form of ""oblivious amplitude amplification"" that can be applied even though the reflection about the input state is unavailable. Finally, we prove new lower bounds showing that our algorithms are optimal as a function of the error."
161,1610.05384,2016,1,2,33,A Short Guide to Anyons and Modular Functors,Simon Burton,"To the working physicist, anyon theory is meant to describe certain quasi-particle excitations occurring in two dimensional topologically ordered systems. A typical calculation using this theory will involve operations such as $\otimes$ to combine anyons, $F^{abc}_{d}$ to re-associate such combinations, and $R^{ab}_c$ to commute or braid these anyons. Although there is a powerful string-diagram notation that greatly assists these manipulations, we still appear to be operating on particles arranged on a one-dimensional line, algebraically ordered from left to right. The obvious question is, where is the other dimension? The topological framework for considering these anyons as truly living in a two dimensional space is known as a modular functor, or topological quantum field theory. In this work we show how the apparently one-dimensional algebraic anyon theory is secretly the theory of anyons living in a fully two-dimensional system. The mathematical literature covering this secret is vast, and we try to distill this down into something more manageable."

Our algorithm provides a quantum speedup in a natural regime where the sampling rate is much higher than the number of sinusoid components. Along the way, we develop techniques that are expected to be useful for other quantum algorithms as well - consecutive phase estimations to efficiently make products of asymmetric low rank matrices classically accessible and an alternative method to efficiently exponentiate non-Hermitian matrices. Our algorithm features an efficient quantum-classical division of labor: The time-critical steps are implemented in quantum superposition, while an interjacent step, requiring only exponentially few parameters, can operate classically. We show that frequencies and damping factors can be obtained in time logarithmic in the number of sampling points, exponentially faster than known classical algorithms."
163,1609.02416,2016,9,28,33,A quantum-inspired algorithm for estimating the permanent of positive semidefinite matrices,L Chakhmakhchyan;Nicolas J Cerf;Raúl García-Patrón,"We construct a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for computing the permanent of Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices, by exploiting a connection between these mathematical structures and the boson sampling model. Specifically, the permanent of a Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix can be expressed in terms of the expected value of a random variable, which stands for a specific photon-counting probability when measuring a linear-optically evolved random multimode coherent state. Our algorithm then approximates the matrix permanent from the corresponding sample mean and is shown to run in polynomial time for various sets of Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices, achieving a precision that improves over known techniques. This work illustrates how quantum optics may benefit algorithms development."
164,1609.00510,2016,9,27,33,Local Decoders for the 2D and 4D Toric Code,Nikolas P Breuckmann;Kasper Duivenvoorden;Dominik Michels;Barbara M Terhal,We analyze the performance of decoders for the 2D and 4D toric code which are local by construction. The 2D decoder is a cellular automaton decoder formulated by Harrington which explicitly has a finite speed of communication and computation. For a model of independent $X$ and $Z$ errors and faulty syndrome measurements with identical probability we report a threshold of $0.133\%$ for this Harrington decoder. We implement a decoder for the 4D toric code which is based on a decoder by Hastings arXiv:1312.2546 . Incorporating a method for handling faulty syndromes we estimate a threshold of $1.59\%$ for the same noise model as in the 2D case. We compare the performance of this decoder with a decoder based on a 4D version of Toom's cellular automaton rule as well as the decoding method suggested by Dennis et al. arXiv:quant-ph/0110143 .
165,1607.01797,2016,9,9,33,Simple and tight device-independent security proofs,Rotem Arnon-Friedman;Renato Renner;Thomas Vidick,"Proving security of device-independent (DI) cryptographic protocols has been regarded to be a complex and tedious task. In this work we show that a newly developed tool, the ""entropy accumulation theorem"" of Dupuis et al., can be effectively applied to give fully general proofs of DI security. At a high level our technique amounts to establishing a reduction to the scenario in which the untrusted device operates in an identical and independent way in each round of the protocol. This makes the proof much simpler and yields significantly better, essentially tight, quantitative results when considering general quantum adversaries, compared to what was known before. As concrete applications we give simple and modular security proofs for DI quantum key distribution and randomness expansion protocols based on the CHSH inequality. For both tasks we establish essentially optimal key rates and noise tolerance. As loophole-free Bell tests are finally being realised, our results considerably decrease the gap between theory and experiments, thereby marking an important step towards practical DI protocols and their implementations."

In particular, we strengthen Lieb's triple matrix inequality. As an example application of our four matrix extension of the Golden-Thompson inequality, we prove remainder terms for the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy and strong sub-additivity of the von Neumann entropy in terms of recoverability. We find the first explicit remainder terms that are tight in the commutative case. Our proofs rely on complex interpolation theory as well as asymptotic spectral pinching, providing a transparent approach to treat generic multivariate trace inequalities."
167,1601.06752,2016,7,8,33,Device-independent two-party cryptography secure against sequential attacks,Jędrzej Kaniewski;Stephanie Wehner,"The goal of two-party cryptography is to enable two parties, Alice and Bob, to solve common tasks without the need for mutual trust. Examples of such tasks are private access to a database, and secure identification. Quantum communication enables security for all of these problems in the noisy-storage model by sending more signals than the adversary can store in a certain time frame. Here, we initiate the study of device-independent protocols for two-party cryptography in the noisy-storage model. Specifically, we present a relatively easy to implement protocol for a cryptographic building block known as weak string erasure and prove its security even if the devices used in the protocol are prepared by the dishonest party. Device-independent two-party cryptography is made challenging by the fact that Alice and Bob do not trust each other, which requires new techniques to establish security. We fully analyse the case of memoryless devices (for which sequential attacks are optimal) and the case of sequential attacks for arbitrary devices. The key ingredient of the proof, which might be of independent interest, is an explicit (and tight) relation between the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality observed by Alice and Bob and uncertainty generated by Alice against Bob who is forced to measure his system before finding out Alice's setting (guessing with postmeasurement information). In particular, we show that security is possible for arbitrarily small violation."
168,1512.06069,2015,4,12,33,Demonstration of quantum advantage in machine learning,D Ristè;Marcus P da Silva;Colm A Ryan;Andrew W Cross;John A Smolin;Jay M Gambetta;Jerry M Chow;Blake R Johnson,"The main promise of quantum computing is to efficiently solve certain problems that are prohibitively expensive for a classical computer. Most problems with a proven quantum advantage involve the repeated use of a black box, or oracle, whose structure encodes the solution. One measure of the algorithmic performance is the query complexity, i.e., the scaling of the number of oracle calls needed to find the solution with a given probability. Few-qubit demonstrations of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover, have been implemented across diverse physical systems such as nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, optical systems, and superconducting circuits. However, at the small scale, these problems can already be solved classically with a few oracle queries, and the attainable quantum advantage is modest. Here we solve an oracle-based problem, known as learning parity with noise, using a five-qubit superconducting processor. Running classical and quantum algorithms on the same oracle, we observe a large gap in query count in favor of quantum processing. We find that this gap grows by orders of magnitude as a function of the error rates and the problem size. This result demonstrates that, while complex fault-tolerant architectures will be required for universal quantum computing, a quantum advantage already emerges in existing noisy systems"

We develop a general framework that can be used to prove that QCMA machines, with only classical witnesses, cannot verify certain properties of subsets given implicitly via an oracle. We use this framework to prove an oracle separation between QCMA and QMA using an ``in-place'' permutation oracle, making the first progress on this question since Aaronson and Kuperberg in 2007. We also use the framework to prove a particularly simple standard oracle separation between QCMA and AM."

It achieves $\varepsilon$-approximations using circuits of length $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, which is asymptotically optimal. The algorithm achieves the same quality of approximation as previously-known algorithms for Clifford+T [arXiv:1212.6253], V-basis [arXiv:1303.1411] and Clifford+$\pi/12$ [arXiv:1409.3552], running on average in time polynomial in $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ (conditional on a number-theoretic conjecture). Ours is the first such algorithm that works for a wide range of gate sets and provides insight into what should constitute a ""good"" gate set for a fault-tolerant quantum computer."

Previously known general upper bounds on the time scales of equilibration were extremely long, with times scaling linearly with the dimension of the Hilbert space. Moreover, these bounds proved to be tight, since particular constructions of observables scaling in this way were found. In this paper we provide a new upper bound on the equilibration time scales which shows, in fact, equilibration is much faster under some physically reasonable conditions. In particular, we apply this result to give bounds on the time scales of equilibration for a system interacting with a thermal bath which do not scale with the size of the bath."

In contrast, 2-SAT can not only be decided in polynomial time, but in fact in deterministic linear time. In 2006, Bravyi proposed a physically motivated generalization of k-SAT to the quantum setting, defining the problem ""quantum k-SAT"". He showed that quantum 2-SAT is also solvable in polynomial time on a classical computer, in particular in deterministic time O(n^4), assuming unit-cost arithmetic over a field extension of the rational numbers, where n is number of variables. In this paper, we present an algorithm for quantum 2-SAT which runs in linear time, i.e. deterministic time O(n+m) for n and m the number of variables and clauses, respectively. Our approach exploits the transfer matrix techniques of Laumann et al. [QIC, 2010] used in the study of phase transitions for random quantum 2-SAT, and bears similarities with both the linear time 2-SAT algorithms of Even, Itai, and Shamir (based on backtracking) [SICOMP, 1976] and Aspvall, Plass, and Tarjan (based on strongly connected components) [IPL, 1979]."
173,1508.06624,2015,10,15,33,Discriminating quantum states: the multiple Chernoff distance,Ke Li,"We consider the problem of testing multiple quantum hypotheses $\{\rho_1^{\otimes n},\ldots,\rho_r^{\otimes n}\}$, where an arbitrary prior distribution is given and each of the $r$ hypotheses is $n$ copies of a quantum state. It is known that the average error probability $P_e$ decays exponentially to zero, that is, $P_e=\exp\{-\xi n+o(n)\}$. However, this error exponent $\xi$ is generally unknown, except for the case that $r=2$. In this paper, we solve the long-standing open problem of identifying the above error exponent, by proving Nussbaum and Szkoła's conjecture that $\xi=\min_{i\neq j}C(\rho_i,\rho_j)$. The right-hand side of this equality is called the multiple quantum Chernoff distance, and $C(\rho_i,\rho_j):=\max_{0\leq s\leq 1}\{-\log\operatorname{Tr}\rho_i^s\rho_j^{1-s}\}$ has been previously identified as the optimal error exponent for testing two hypotheses, $\rho_i^{\otimes n}$ versus $\rho_j^{\otimes n}$. The main ingredient of our proof is a new upper bound for the average error probability, for testing an ensemble of finite-dimensional, but otherwise general, quantum states. This upper bound, up to a states-dependent factor, matches the multiple-state generalization of Nussbaum and Szkoła's lower bound. Specialized to the case $r=2$, we give an alternative proof to the achievability of the binary-hypothesis Chernoff distance, which was originally proved by Audenaert et al."

We discuss this link using the tree size of a multiqubit state, a complexity measure that has two noticeable (and, so far, unique) features: it is in principle computable, and non-trivial lower bounds can be obtained, hence identifying truly complex states. In this paper, we first review the definition of tree size, together with known results on the most complex three and four qubits states. Moving to the multiqubit case, we revisit a mathematical theorem for proving a lower bound on tree size that scales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. Next, states with superpolynomial tree size, the Immanant states, the Deutsch-Jozsa states, the Shor's states and the subgroup states, are described. We show that the universal resource state for measurement based quantum computation, the 2D-cluster state, has superpolynomial tree size. Moreover, we show how the complexity of subgroup states and the 2D cluster state can be verified efficiently. The question of how tree size is related to the speed up achieved in quantum computation is also addressed. We show that superpolynomial tree size of the resource state is essential for measurement based quantum computation. The necessary role of large tree size in the circuit model of quantum computation is still a conjecture; and we prove a weaker version of the conjecture."
175,1412.6507,2014,9,1,33,"The space ""just above"" BQP",Scott Aaronson;Adam Bouland;Joseph F Fitzsimons;Mitchell Lee,"We explore the space ""just above"" BQP by defining a complexity class PDQP (Product Dynamical Quantum Polynomial time) which is larger than BQP but does not contain NP relative to an oracle. The class is defined by imagining that quantum computers can perform measurements that do not collapse the wavefunction. This (non-physical) model of computation can efficiently solve problems such as Graph Isomorphism and Approximate Shortest Vector which are believed to be intractable for quantum computers. Furthermore, it can search an unstructured N-element list in $\tilde O$(N^1/3) time, but no faster than \Omega(N^1/4), and hence cannot solve NP-hard problems in a black box manner. In short, this model of computation is more powerful than standard quantum computation, but only slightly so. Our work is inspired by previous work of Aaronson on the power of sampling the histories of hidden variables. However Aaronson's work contains an error in its proof of the lower bound for search, and hence it is unclear whether or not his model allows for search in logarithmic time. Our work can be viewed as a conceptual simplification of Aaronson's approach, with a provable polynomial lower bound for search."

First, we show how to implement MLD exactly in time $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of code qubits. Our implementation uses a reduction from MLD to simulation of matchgate quantum circuits. This reduction however requires a special noise model with independent bit-flip and phase-flip errors. Secondly, we show how to implement MLD approximately for more general noise models using matrix product states (MPS). Our implementation has running time $O(n\chi^3)$ where $\chi$ is a parameter that controls the approximation precision. The key step of our algorithm, borrowed from the DMRG method, is a subroutine for contracting a tensor network on the two-dimensional grid. The subroutine uses MPS with a bond dimension $\chi$ to approximate the sequence of tensors arising in the course of contraction. We benchmark the MPS-based decoder against the standard minimum weight matching decoder observing a significant reduction of the logical error probability for $\chi\ge 4$."

In this work we introduce the notion of catalytic decoupling, that is, decoupling in the presence of an uncorrelated ancilla system. This removes a restriction on the standard notion of decoupling, which becomes important for structureless resources, and yields a tight characterization in terms of the max-mutual information. Catalytic decoupling naturally unifies various tasks like the erasure of correlations and quantum state merging, and leads to a resource theory of decoupling."

For all these tasks there is a crucial question to answer: What are their optimal rates without quantum repeaters? Our work solves this basic question for two remote parties connected by a quantum channel in the most relevant practical scenarios, without imposing any restriction on their classical communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. To achieve our results, we first extend the notion of relative entropy of entanglement from quantum states to channels, proving a general upper bound for all the two-way assisted capacities. Then, we design a novel technique, dubbed 'teleportation stretching', which reduces the most general adaptive protocols for quantum or private communication to a simple block form. In this way, we can simplify our upper bound to a single-letter expression for many fundamental channels, establishing exact formulas for the two-way assisted capacities of bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we determine the fundamental rate-loss scaling which affects any quantum optical communication, e.g., for long-distance quantum key distribution. By setting these limits, we also establish the most general and correct benchmarks for testing the performance of quantum repeaters."

Here we explore this connection further. We derive some general results about OAQEC, as well as results that apply specifically to quantum codes which admit a holographic interpretation. We introduce a new quantity called `price', which characterizes the support of a protected logical system, and find constraints on the price and the distance for logical subalgebras of quantum codes. We show that holographic codes defined on bulk manifolds with asymptotically negative curvature exhibit `uberholography', meaning that a bulk logical algebra can be supported on a boundary region with a fractal structure. We argue that, for holographic codes defined on bulk manifolds with asymptotically flat or positive curvature, the boundary physics must be highly nonlocal, an observation with potential implications for black holes and for quantum gravity in AdS space at distance scales small compared to the AdS curvature radius."
181,1609.07488,2016,5,3,32,Application of a resource theory for magic states to fault-tolerant quantum computing,Mark Howard;Earl T Campbell,"Motivated by their necessity for most fault-tolerant quantum computation schemes, we formulate a resource theory for magic states. We first show that robustness of magic is a well-behaved magic monotone that operationally quantifies the classical simulation overhead for a Gottesman-Knill type scheme using ancillary magic states. Our framework subsequently finds immediate application in the task of synthesizing non-Clifford gates using magic states. When magic states are interspersed with Clifford gates, Pauli measurements and stabilizer ancillas - the most general synthesis scenario - then the class of synthesizable unitaries is hard to characterize. Our techniques can place non-trivial lower bounds on the number of magic states required for implementing a given target unitary. Guided by these results we have found new and optimal examples of such synthesis."

We present three main results. First, we obtain a bound on the distillable entanglement of private states in terms of restricted relative entropy measures, which is tight in many cases. Second, we find that protocols for key distillation lead to the distillation of data hiding states. Third, we consider the problem of extending the distance of quantum key distribution with help of intermediate stations. In analogy to the quantum repeater, this paradigm has been called the quantum key repeater. We show that when extending private states, the resulting rate is bounded by the distillable entanglement. In order to swap perfect secrecy it is thus essentially optimal to use entanglement swapping."
183,1607.08535,2016,12,2,32,Why I am optimistic about the silicon-photonic route to quantum computing,Terry G Rudolph,"This is a short overview explaining how building a large-scale, silicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good sources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such sources, each photon need pass through a small, constant, number of components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that allows the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for quantum computation. At present the fully-integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons produced non-determistically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states - necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a `ballistic' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing implemented by single-photon measurements. There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational time-steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such questions."
184,1604.08197,2016,9,22,32,Ancilla dimension in quantum channel discrimination,Daniel Puzzuoli;John Watrous,"Single-shot quantum channel discrimination is a fundamental task in quantum information theory. It is well known that entanglement with an ancillary system can help in this task, and furthermore that an ancilla with the same dimension as the input of the channels is always sufficient for optimal discrimination of two channels. A natural question to ask is whether the same holds true for the output dimension. That is, in cases when the output dimension of the channels is (possibly much) smaller than the input dimension, is an ancilla with dimension equal to the output dimension always sufficient for optimal discrimination? We show that the answer to this question is ""no"" by construction of a family of counterexamples. This family contains instances with arbitrary finite gap between the input and output dimensions, and still has the property that in every case, for optimal discrimination, it is necessary to use an ancilla with dimension equal to that of the input. The proof relies on a characterization of all operators on the trace norm unit sphere that maximize entanglement negativity. In the case of density operators we generalize this characterization to a broad class of entanglement measures, which we call weak entanglement measures. This characterization allows us to conclude that a quantum channel is reversible if and only if it preserves entanglement as measured by any weak entanglement measure, with the structure of maximally entangled states being equivalent to the structure of reversible maps via the Choi isomorphism. We also include alternate proofs of other known characterizations of channel reversibility."

However, these methods are strongly limited by the requirement that the evolution of the system between pulses be suitably small. Here we show how refocusing may be achieved for arbitrary (but time-independent) evolution of the system between pulses. We first illustrate the procedure with one-qubit systems, and then generalize to $d$-dimensional quantum systems. We also give an application of this result to quantum computation, proving a new version of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that does not require inverse gates."

187,1602.03539,2016,4,28,32,Efficient classical simulation of matchgate circuits with generalized inputs and measurements,Daniel J Brod,"Matchgates are a restricted set of two-qubit gates known to be classically simulable under particular conditions. Specifically, if a circuit consists only of nearest-neighbour matchgates, an efficient classical simulation is possible if either (i) the input is a computational basis state and the simulation requires computing probabilities of multi-qubit outcomes (including also adaptive measurements), or (ii) if the input is an arbitrary product state, but the output of the circuit consists of a single qubit. In this paper we extend these results to show that matchgates are classically simulable even in the most general combination of these settings, namely, if the inputs are arbitrary product states, if the measurements are over arbitrarily many output qubits, and if adaptive measurements are allowed. This remains true even for arbitrary single-qubit measurements, albeit only in a weaker notion of classical simulation. These results make for an interesting contrast with other restricted models of computation, such as Clifford circuits or (bosonic) linear optics, where the complexity of simulation varies greatly under similar modifications."
188,1512.04375,2015,2,26,32,Post hoc verification of quantum computation,Joseph F Fitzsimons;Michal Hajdušek,"With recent progress on experimental quantum information processing, an important question has arisen as to whether it is possible to verify arbitrary computation performed on a quantum processor. A number of protocols have been proposed to achieve this goal, however all are interactive in nature, requiring that the computation be performed in an interactive manner with back and forth communication between the verifier and one or more provers. Here we propose two methods for verifying quantum computation in a non-interactive manner based on recent progress in the understanding of the local Hamiltonian problem. Provided that the provers compute certain witnesses for the computation, this allows the result of a quantum computation to be verified after the fact, a property not seen in current verification protocols."

Using the framework of nonlocal games, we relate measures of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics to certain norms in the Banach and operator space categories. We survey recent results that exploit this connection to derive large violations of Bell inequalities, study the complexity of the classical and quantum values of games and their relation to Grothendieck inequalities, and quantify the nonlocality of different classes of entangled states."
190,1511.08818,2015,2,12,32,Resource theories of knowledge,Lídia del Rio;Lea Kraemer;Renato Renner,"How far can we take the resource theoretic approach to explore physics? Resource theories like LOCC, reference frames and quantum thermodynamics have proven a powerful tool to study how agents who are subject to certain constraints can act on physical systems. This approach has advanced our understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the second law of thermodynamics, and provided operational measures to quantify resources such as entanglement or information content. In this work, we significantly extend the approach and range of applicability of resource theories. Firstly we generalize the notion of resource theories to include any description or knowledge that agents may have of a physical state, beyond the density operator formalism. We show how to relate theories that differ in the language used to describe resources, like micro and macroscopic thermodynamics. Finally, we take a top-down approach to locality, in which a subsystem structure is derived from a global theory rather than assumed. The extended framework introduced here enables us to formalize new tasks in the language of resource theories, ranging from tomography, cryptography, thermodynamics and foundational questions, both within and beyond quantum theory."

The defining feature of these representations is that topological order is a consequence of the symmetry of the underlying tensors in terms of matrix product operators. In this paper, we present a systematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates entanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of fusion tensor categories. From the matrix product operators we construct a C*-algebra and find that topological sectors can be identified with the central idempotents of this algebra. This allows us to construct projected entangled-pair states containing an arbitrary number of anyons. Properties such as topological spin, the S matrix, fusion and braiding relations can readily be extracted from the idempotents. As the matrix product operator symmetries are acting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson loops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the possibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group fixed points. We illustrate the general formalism for the special cases of discrete gauge theories and string-net models."
192,1509.07127,2015,12,2,32,Universal recovery from a decrease of quantum relative entropy,Marius Junge;Renato Renner;David Sutter;Mark M Wilde;Andreas Winter,"The data processing inequality states that the quantum relative entropy between two states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ can never increase by applying the same quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$ to both states. This inequality can be strengthened with a remainder term in the form of a distance between $\rho$ and the closest recovered state $(\mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{N})(\rho)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a recovery map with the property that $\sigma = (\mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{N})(\sigma)$. We show the existence of an explicit recovery map that is universal in the sense that it depends only on $\sigma$ and the quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$ to be reversed. This result gives an alternate, information-theoretic characterization of the conditions for approximate quantum error correction."

While the evolution of a quantum state under a Hamiltonian is straightforward (if sometimes expensive), using quantum computers to determine the ground state phase diagram of a quantum model and the properties of its phases is more involved. Using the Hubbard model as a prototypical example, we here show all the steps necessary to determine its phase diagram and ground state properties on a quantum computer. In particular, we discuss strategies for efficiently determining and preparing the ground state of the Hubbard model starting from various mean-field states with broken symmetry. We present an efficient procedure to prepare arbitrary Slater determinants as initial states and present the complete set of quantum circuits needed to evolve from these to the ground state of the Hubbard model. We show that, using efficient nesting of the various terms each time step in the evolution can be performed with just $\mathcal{O}(N)$ gates and $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ circuit depth. We give explicit circuits to measure arbitrary local observables and static and dynamic correlation functions, both in the time and frequency domain. We further present efficient non-destructive approaches to measurement that avoid the need to re-prepare the ground state after each measurement and that quadratically reduce the measurement error."
194,1506.03815,2015,9,25,32,Classical Simulation of Quantum Error Correction in a Fibonacci Anyon Code,Simon Burton;Courtney G Brell;Steven T Flammia,"Classically simulating the dynamics of anyonic excitations in two-dimensional quantum systems is likely intractable in general because such dynamics are sufficient to implement universal quantum computation. However, processes of interest for the study of quantum error correction in anyon systems are typically drawn from a restricted class that displays significant structure over a wide range of system parameters. We exploit this structure to classically simulate, and thereby demonstrate the success of, an error-correction protocol for a quantum memory based on the universal Fibonacci anyon model. We numerically simulate a phenomenological model of the system and noise processes on lattice sizes of up to 128x128 sites, and find a lower bound on the error-correction threshold of approximately 12.5%, which is comparable to those previously known for abelian and (non-universal) nonabelian anyon models."
195,1505.06468,2015,6,18,32,Random MERA States and the Tightness of the Brandao-Horodecki Entropy Bound,Matthew B Hastings,"We construct a random MERA state with a bond dimension that varies with the level of the MERA. This causes the state to exhibit a very different entanglement structure from that usually seen in MERA, with neighboring intervals of length $l$ exhibiting a mutual information proportional to $\epsilon l$ for some constant $\epsilon$, up to a length scale exponentially large in $\epsilon$. We express the entropy of a random MERA in terms of sums over cuts through the MERA network, with the entropy in this case controlled by the cut minimizing bond dimensions cut through. One motivation for this construction is to investigate the tightness of the Brandao-Horodecki\citebh entropy bound relating entanglement to correlation decay. Using the random MERA, we show that at least part of the proof is tight: there do exist states with the required property of having linear mutual information between neighboring intervals at all length scales. We conjecture that this state has exponential correlation decay and that it demonstrates that the Brandao-Horodecki bound is tight (at least up to constant factors), and we provide some numerical evidence for this as well as a sketch of how a proof of correlation decay might proceed."
196,1504.06459,2015,6,15,32,$k$-extendibility of high-dimensional bipartite quantum states,Cécilia Lancien,"The idea of detecting the entanglement of a given bipartite state by searching for symmetric extensions of this state was first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialeri. The complete family of separability tests it generates, often referred to as the hierarchy of $k$-extendibility tests, has already proved to be most promising. The goal of this paper is to try and quantify the efficiency of this separability criterion in typical scenarios. For that, we essentially take two approaches. First, we compute the average width of the set of $k$-extendible states, in order to see how it scales with the one of separable states. And second, we characterize when random-induced states are, depending on the ancilla dimension, with high probability violating or not the $k$-extendibility test, and compare the obtained result with the corresponding one for entanglement vs separability. The main results can be precisely phrased as follows: on $\mathbf{C}^d\otimes\mathbf{C}^d$, when $d$ grows, the average width of the set of $k$-extendible states is equivalent to $(2/\sqrt{k})/d$, while random states obtained as partial traces over an environment $\mathbf{C}^s$ of uniformly distributed pure states are violating the $k$-extendibility test with probability going to $1$ if $s<((k-1)^2/4k)d^2$. Both statements converge to the conclusion that, if $k$ is fixed, $k$-extendibility is asymptotically a weak approximation of separability, even though any of the other well-studied separability relaxations is outperformed by $k$-extendibility as soon as $k$ is above a certain (dimension independent) value."

In this work, we establish a novel link between dynamical properties - the absence of a group velocity and transport - with entanglement properties of individual eigenvectors. Using Lieb-Robinson bounds and filter functions, we prove rigorously under simple assumptions on the spectrum that if a system shows strong dynamical localisation, all of its many-body eigenvectors have clustering correlations. In one dimension this implies directly an entanglement area law, hence the eigenvectors can be approximated by matrix-product states. We also show this statement for parts of the spectrum, allowing for the existence of a mobility edge above which transport is possible."
199,1406.2338,2014,4,24,32,Cellular-automaton decoders for topological quantum memories,Michael Herold;Earl T Campbell;Jens Eisert;Michael J Kastoryano,"We introduce a new framework for constructing topological quantum memories, by recasting error recovery as a dynamical process on a field generating cellular automaton. We envisage quantum systems controlled by a classical hardware composed of small local memories, communicating with neighbours, and repeatedly performing identical simple update rules. This approach does not require any global operations or complex decoding algorithms. Our cellular automata draw inspiration from classical field theories, with a Coulomb-like potential naturally emerging from the local dynamics. For a 3D automaton coupled to a 2D toric code, we present evidence of an error correction threshold above 6.1% for uncorrelated noise. A 2D automaton equipped with a more complex update rule yields a threshold above 8.2%. Our framework provides decisive new tools in the quest for realising a passive dissipative quantum memory."

This survey provides an introduction to the rapidly growing field of Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity, which includes the study of quantum constraint satisfaction problems. Over the past decade and a half, this field has witnessed fundamental breakthroughs, ranging from the establishment of a ""Quantum Cook-Levin Theorem"" to deep insights into the structure of 1D low-temperature quantum systems via so-called area laws. Our aim here is to provide a computer science-oriented introduction to the subject in order to help bridge the language barrier between computer scientists and physicists in the field. As such, we include the following in this survey: (1) The motivations and history of the field, (2) a glossary of condensed matter physics terms explained in computer-science friendly language, (3) overviews of central ideas from condensed matter physics, such as indistinguishable particles, mean field theory, tensor networks, and area laws, and (4) brief expositions of selected computer science-based results in the area. For example, as part of the latter, we provide a novel information theoretic presentation of Bravyi's polynomial time algorithm for Quantum 2-SAT."

The particles can move between adjacent vertices and experience a repulsive on-site interaction. The Hamiltonian is determined by a choice of graph that specifies the geometry in which the particles move and interact. We prove that approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on a graph at fixed particle number is QMA-complete. In our QMA-hardness proof, we encode the history of an n-qubit computation in the subspace with at most one particle per site (i.e., hard-core bosons). This feature, along with the well-known mapping between hard-core bosons and spin systems, lets us prove a related result for a class of 2-local Hamiltonians defined by graphs that generalizes the XY model. By avoiding the use of perturbation theory in our analysis, we circumvent the need to multiply terms in the Hamiltonian by large coefficients."

Typically, they are studied using the complexity class QMA (quantum counterpart of NP) but some natural computational problems appear to be slightly harder than QMA. We introduce new complexity classes consisting of problems that are solvable with a small number of queries to a QMA oracle and use these complexity classes to quantify the complexity of several natural computational problems (for example, the complexity of estimating the spectral gap of a Hamiltonian)."

In this article, we propose a complementary ""soft code-spaces"" wherein a weighted prior distribution is assumed over the possible logical input states. The performance for protecting information from noise is then evaluated in terms of entanglement fidelity. We apply a recent construction for approximate recovery maps, which come with a guaranteed lower-bounds on the decoding performance. These lower bound are straightforwardly obtained by evaluating entropies on marginals of the mixed state which represents the ""soft code-space"". As an example, we consider thermal states of the transverse field Ising model at criticality and provide numerical evidence that the entanglement fidelity admits non-trivial recoverability from local errors. This provides the first concrete interpretation of a bonafide conformal field theory as a quantum error-correcting code. We further suggest, that quantum source-channel codes could provide a framework to interpret the information structure of holography."

We give the first efficient quantum algorithms for simulating Markovian quantum dynamics generated by Lindbladians that are not necessarily local. We introduce two approaches to simulating sparse Lindbladians. First, we show how to simulate Lindbladians that act within small invariant subspaces using a quantum algorithm to implement sparse Stinespring isometries. Second, we develop a method for simulating sparse Lindblad operators by concatenating a sequence of short-time evolutions. We also show limitations on Lindbladian simulation by proving a no-fast-forwarding theorem for simulating sparse Lindbladians in a black-box model."

We provide the compact form criteria leading to a simple algorithm that allows deciding universality of any given set of gates in a finite number of steps. Moreover, for a non-universal $\mathcal{S}$ our criteria indicate what type of gates can be added to $\mathcal{S}$ to turn it into a universal set."

We show the mutual information between two regions A and C conditioned on a middle region B decays exponentially with the square root of the length of B. Conversely, we also prove that any one-dimensional quantum state with small conditional mutual information in all tripartite splits of the line can be well-approximated by a Gibbs state of a local quantum Hamiltonian. These two results constitute a variant for one-dimensional quantum systems of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem (which characterizes Markov networks, i.e. probability distributions which have vanishing conditional mutual information, as Gibbs states of classical Hamiltonians). The result can be seen as a strengthening -- for one-dimensional systems -- of the mutual information area law for thermal states. It directly implies a method to efficiently prepare any one-dimensional Gibbs state at finite temperature by a constant-depth quantum circuit."

We study what quantum measurements are projective simulable, that is, can be simulated by using projective measurements and classical randomness. We first prove that every measurement on a given quantum system can be realised by classical processing of projective measurements on the system plus an ancilla of the same dimension. Then, given a general measurement in dimension two or three, we show that deciding whether it is projective-simulable can be solved by means of semi-definite programming. We also establish conditions for the simulation of measurements using projective ones valid for any dimension. As an application of our formalism, we improve the range of visibilities for which two-qubit Werner states do not violate any Bell inequality for all measurements. From an implementation point of view, our work provides bounds on the amount of noise a measurement tolerates before losing any advantage over projective ones."
208,1607.03104,2016,9,21,31,Quantum Coarse-Graining: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Thermodynamics,Philippe Faist,"We investigate fundamental connections between thermodynamics and quantum information theory. First, we show that the operational framework of thermal operations is nonequivalent to the framework of Gibbs-preserving maps, and we comment on this gap. We then introduce a fully information-theoretic framework generalizing the above by making further abstraction of physical quantities such as energy. It is technically convenient to work with and reproduces known results for finite-size quantum thermodynamics. With our framework we may determine the minimal work cost of implementing any logical process. In the case of information processing on memory registers with a degenerate Hamiltonian, the answer is given by the max-entropy, a measure of information known from quantum information theory. In the general case, we obtain a new information measure, the ""coherent relative entropy"", which generalizes both the conditional entropy and the relative entropy. It satisfies a collection of properties which justifies its interpretation as an entropy measure and which connects it to known quantities. We then present how, from our framework, macroscopic thermodynamics emerges by typicality, after singling out an appropriate class of thermodynamic states possessing some suitable reversibility property. A natural thermodynamic potential emerges, dictating possible state transformations, and whose differential describes the physics of the system. The textbook thermodynamics of a gas is recovered as well as the form of the second law relating thermodynamic entropy and heat exchange. Finally, noting that quantum states are relative to the observer, we see that the procedure above gives rise to a natural form of coarse-graining in quantum mechanics: Each observer can consistently apply the formalism of quantum information according to their own fundamental unit of information."
209,1605.01718,2016,7,13,31,The Complexity of Translationally-Invariant Spin Chains with Low Local Dimension,Johannes Bausch;Toby S Cubitt;Maris Ozols,"We prove that estimating the smallest eigenvalue of a translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 1D chain of quantum systems is QMAEXP-complete, even for systems of low dimension. This improves on the work by Gottesman and Irani (2009), where this dimension was several orders of magnitude larger, whereas our dimension is comparable to the best-known non-translationally-invariant result by Hallgren et al. (2013). The main novelty of our work is the introduction of a new approach to encoding quantum computation in the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, and for analyzing its ground state energy. While previous constructions directly encoded one of the standard models, we introduce a new Turing-complete model of quantum computation - a quantum ring machine. We then translate the ring machine of a QMAEXP verifier into another new model - a quantum Thue system. This hybrid classical-quantum model is an extension of string rewriting systems and is specifically tailored to encoding quantum computation in a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian with translationally-invariant interactions. This allows us to shift the proof burden from simplifying the Hamiltonians used to encode a standard computational model, to proving universality of a very simplified model. While previous constructions could accommodate only serial computation, quantum Thue systems allow for non-determinism and concurrency. This requires more sophisticated techniques for analyzing the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian: we relate it to the Laplacian of a graph with unitary edge weights. To capture the non-deterministic branching in the computational path, we allow arbitrary graphs, including ones with cycles, which goes beyond path graphs considered in all previous constructions."

We prove that the algorithm solves this decision problem with high probability for n qubits, L clauses, and promise gap c in time O(n^2 L^2 c^-2). If the Hamiltonian is additionally polynomially gapped, our algorithm efficiently produces a state that has high overlap with the satisfying subspace. The Markov process we study is a quantum analogue of Schöning's probabilistic algorithm for k-SAT."

We continue with this line of research and show that the NS/PPTp/NS$\cap$PPTp codes assisted zero-error quantum capacity depends only on the non-commutative bipartite graph of the channel and the one-shot case can be computed efficiently by semidefinite programming (SDP). As an example, the activated PPTp codes assisted zero-error quantum capacity is carefully studied. We then present a general SDP upper bound $Q_\Gamma$ of quantum capacity and show it is always smaller than or equal to the ""Partial transposition bound"" introduced by Holevo and Werner, and the inequality could be strict. This upper bound is found to be additive, and thus is an upper bound of the potential PPTp assisted quantum capacity as well. We further demonstrate that $Q_\Gamma$ is strictly better than several previously known upper bounds for an explicit class of quantum channels. Finally, we show that $Q_\Gamma$ can be used to bound the super-activation of quantum capacity."

We show that its complementary channel has positive quantum capacity for all $\eta>0$. Thus, we find that there exists a single parameter family of channels having the peculiar property of having positive quantum capacity even when the outputs of these channels approach a fixed state independent of the input. Comparisons with other related channels, and implications on the difficulty of studying the quantum capacity of the depolarizing channel are discussed."

Such schemes, however, implicitly rely on the assumptions that solving certain computation problems are intractable. Here we present a quantum encryption scheme which is homomorphic for arbitrary classical and quantum circuits which have at most some constant number of non-Clifford gates. Unlike classical schemes, the security of the scheme we present is information theoretic, satisfying entropic security definitions, and hence independent of the computational power of an adversary."

We show this is false by giving an example of a total boolean function $f$ on $n$ bits whose deterministic query complexity is $\Omega(n/\log(n))$ while its zero-error randomized query complexity is $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. We further show that the quantum query complexity of the same function is $\tilde O(n^{1/4})$, giving the first example of a total function with a super-quadratic gap between its quantum and deterministic query complexities. We also construct a total boolean function $g$ on $n$ variables that has zero-error randomized query complexity $\Omega(n/\log(n))$ and bounded-error randomized query complexity $R(g) = \tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. This is the first super-linear separation between these two complexity measures. The exact quantum query complexity of the same function is $Q_E(g) = \tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. These two functions show that the relations $D(f) = O(R_1(f)^2)$ and $R_0(f) = \tilde O(R(f)^2)$ are optimal, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Further variations of these functions give additional separations between other query complexity measures: a cubic separation between $Q$ and $R_0$, a $3/2$-power separation between $Q_E$ and $R$, and a 4th power separation between approximate degree and bounded-error randomized query complexity. All of these examples are variants of a function recently introduced by \goos, Pitassi, and Watson which they used to separate the unambiguous 1-certificate complexity from deterministic query complexity and to resolve the famous Clique versus Independent Set problem in communication complexity."
217,1505.07811,2015,8,5,31,How fast do stabilizer Hamiltonians thermalize?,Kristan Temme;Michael J Kastoryano,"We present rigorous bounds on the thermalization time of the family of quantum mechanical spin systems known as stabilizer Hamiltonians. The thermalizing dynamics are modeled by a Davies master equation that arises from a weak local coupling of the system to a large thermal bath. Two temperature regimes are considered. First we clarify how in the low temperature regime, the thermalization time is governed by a generalization of the energy barrier between orthogonal ground states. When no energy barrier is present the Hamiltonian thermalizes in a time that is at most quadratic in the system size. Secondly, we show that above a universal critical temperature, every stabilizer Hamiltonian relaxes to its unique thermal state in a time which scales at most linearly in the size of the system. We provide an explicit lower bound on the critical temperature. Finally, we discuss the implications of these result for the problem of self-correcting quantum memories with stabilizer Hamiltonians."
218,1502.07973,2015,6,16,31,The Fidelity of Recovery is Multiplicative,Mario Berta;Marco Tomamichel,"Fawzi and Renner [Commun. Math. Phys. 340(2):575, 2015] recently established a lower bound on the conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) of tripartite quantum states $ABC$ in terms of the fidelity of recovery (FoR), i.e. the maximal fidelity of the state $ABC$ with a state reconstructed from its marginal $BC$ by acting only on the $C$ system. The FoR measures quantum correlations by the local recoverability of global states and has many properties similar to the CQMI. Here we generalize the FoR and show that the resulting measure is multiplicative by utilizing semi-definite programming duality. This allows us to simplify an operational proof by Brandao et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115(5):050501, 2015] of the above-mentioned lower bound that is based on quantum state redistribution. In particular, in contrast to the previous approaches, our proof does not rely on de Finetti reductions."
219,1501.05028,2015,5,29,31,Quantum Spectrum Testing,Ryan O'Donnell;John Wright,"In this work, we study the problem of testing properties of the spectrum of a mixed quantum state. Here one is given $n$ copies of a mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ and the goal is to distinguish whether $\rho$'s spectrum satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$ or is at least $\epsilon$-far in $\ell_1$-distance from satisfying $\mathcal{P}$. This problem was promoted in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf under the name of testing unitarily invariant properties of mixed states. It is the natural quantum analogue of the classical problem of testing symmetric properties of probability distributions. Here, the hope is for algorithms with subquadratic copy complexity in the dimension $d$. This is because the ""empirical Young diagram (EYD) algorithm"" can estimate the spectrum of a mixed state up to $\epsilon$-accuracy using only $\widetilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies. In this work, we show that given a mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$: (i) $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to test whether $\rho$ is the maximally mixed state, i.e., has spectrum $(\frac1d, ..., \frac1d)$; (ii) $\Theta(r^2/\epsilon)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to test with one-sided error whether $\rho$ has rank $r$, i.e., has at most $r$ nonzero eigenvalues; (iii) $\widetilde{\Theta}(r^2/\Delta)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to distinguish whether $\rho$ is maximally mixed on an $r$-dimensional or an $(r+\Delta)$-dimensional subspace; and (iv) The EYD algorithm requires $\Omega(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies to estimate the spectrum of $\rho$ up to $\epsilon$-accuracy, nearly matching the known upper bound. In addition, we simplify part of the proof of the upper bound. Our techniques involve the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric group; in particular Kerov's algebra of polynomial functions on Young diagrams."

At the same time, algorithms for quantum computers have been shown to efficiently solve some problems that are intractable on conventional, classical computers. We show that quantum computing not only reduces the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, but also provides a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing and leads to significant improvements in the optimization of the underlying objective function. Our quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, fully connected models and do not have well known classical counterparts."
221,1409.5946,2014,1,22,31,Entanglement area law from specific heat capacity,Fernando G S L Brandão;Marcus Cramer,"We study the scaling of entanglement in low-energy states of quantum many-body models on lattices of arbitrary dimensions. We allow for unbounded Hamiltonians such that systems with bosonic degrees of freedom are included. We show that if at low enough temperatures the specific heat capacity of the model decays exponentially with inverse temperature, the entanglement in every low-energy state satisfies an area law (with a logarithmic correction). This behaviour of the heat capacity is typically observed in gapped systems. Assuming merely that the low-temperature specific heat decays polynomially with temperature, we find a subvolume scaling of entanglement. Our results give experimentally verifiable conditions for area laws, show that they are a generic property of low-energy states of matter, and, to the best of our knowledge, constitute the first proof of an area law for unbounded Hamiltonians beyond those that are integrable."
222,1409.4800,2014,12,12,31,The computational power of normalizer circuits over black-box groups,Juan Bermejo-Vega;Cedric Yen-Yu Lin;Maarten Van den Nest,"This work presents a precise connection between Clifford circuits, Shor's factoring algorithm and several other famous quantum algorithms with exponential quantum speed-ups for solving Abelian hidden subgroup problems. We show that all these different forms of quantum computation belong to a common new restricted model of quantum operations that we call \emphblack-box normalizer circuits. To define these, we extend the previous model of normalizer circuits [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], which are built of quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism and quadratic phase gates associated to an Abelian group $G$. In previous works, the group $G$ is always given in an explicitly decomposed form. In our model, we remove this assumption and allow $G$ to be a black-box group. While standard normalizer circuits were shown to be efficiently classically simulable [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], we find that normalizer circuits are powerful enough to factorize and solve classically-hard problems in the black-box setting. We further set upper limits to their computational power by showing that decomposing finite Abelian groups is complete for the associated complexity class. In particular, solving this problem renders black-box normalizer circuits efficiently classically simulable by exploiting the generalized stabilizer formalism in [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208]. Lastly, we employ our connection to draw a few practical implications for quantum algorithm design: namely, we give a no-go theorem for finding new quantum algorithms with black-box normalizer circuits, a universality result for low-depth normalizer circuits, and identify two other complete problems."
223,1409.3898,2014,9,23,31,Protected gates for topological quantum field theories,Michael E Beverland;Oliver Buerschaper;Robert Koenig;Fernando Pastawski;John Preskill;Sumit Sijher,"We study restrictions on locality-preserving unitary logical gates for topological quantum codes in two spatial dimensions. A locality-preserving operation is one which maps local operators to local operators --- for example, a constant-depth quantum circuit of geometrically local gates, or evolution for a constant time governed by a geometrically-local bounded-strength Hamiltonian. Locality-preserving logical gates of topological codes are intrinsically fault tolerant because spatially localized errors remain localized, and hence sufficiently dilute errors remain correctable. By invoking general properties of two-dimensional topological field theories, we find that the locality-preserving logical gates are severely limited for codes which admit non-abelian anyons; in particular, there are no locality-preserving logical gates on the torus or the sphere with M punctures if the braiding of anyons is computationally universal. Furthermore, for Ising anyons on the M-punctured sphere, locality-preserving gates must be elements of the logical Pauli group. We derive these results by relating logical gates of a topological code to automorphisms of the Verlinde algebra of the corresponding anyon model, and by requiring the logical gates to be compatible with basis changes in the logical Hilbert space arising from local F-moves and the mapping class group."
224,1409.3435,2014,9,18,31,Quantum Gibbs Samplers: the commuting case,Michael J Kastoryano;Fernando G S L Brandão,"We analyze the problem of preparing quantum Gibbs states of lattice spin Hamiltonians with local and commuting terms on a quantum computer and in nature. Our central result is an equivalence between the behavior of correlations in the Gibbs state and the mixing time of the semigroup which drives the system to thermal equilibrium (the Gibbs sampler). We introduce a framework for analyzing the correlation and mixing characteristics of quantum Gibbs states and quantum Gibbs samplers, which is rooted in the theory of non-commutative Lp spaces. We consider two distinct classes of Gibbs samplers, one of which being the well-studied Davies generators modelling the dynamics on the system due to weak-coupling with a large Markovian environment. We show that their gap is independent of system size if, and only if, a certain strong form of clustering of correlations holds in the Gibbs state. As concrete applications of our formalism, we show that for every one-dimensional lattice system, or for systems in lattices of any dimension at high enough temperatures, the Gibbs samplers of commuting Hamiltonians are always gapped, giving an efficient way of preparing these states on a quantum computer."
225,1409.1570,2014,9,16,31,Is the quantum state real? An extended review of $\psi$-ontology theorems,Matthew S Leifer,"Towards the end of 2011, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph derived a theorem that aimed to show that the quantum state must be ontic (a state of reality) in a broad class of realist approaches to quantum theory. This result attracted a lot of attention and controversy. The aim of this review article is to review the background to the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem, to provide a clear presentation of the theorem itself, and to review related work that has appeared since the publication of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph paper. In particular, this review: Explains what it means for the quantum state to be ontic or epistemic (a state of knowledge); Reviews arguments for and against an ontic interpretation of the quantum state as they existed prior to the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem; Explains why proving the reality of the quantum state is a very strong constraint on realist theories in that it would imply many of the known no-go theorems, such as Bell's Theorem and the need for an exponentially large ontic state space; Provides a comprehensive presentation of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem itself, along with subsequent improvements and criticisms of its assumptions; Reviews two other arguments for the reality of the quantum state: the first due to Hardy and the second due to Colbeck and Renner, and explains why their assumptions are less compelling than those of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem; Reviews subsequent work aimed at ruling out stronger notions of what it means for the quantum state to be epistemic and points out open questions in this area. The overall aim is not only to provide the background needed for the novice in this area to understand the current status, but also to discuss often overlooked subtleties that should be of interest to the experts."
226,1404.5504,2014,9,12,31,Single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction,H Bombin,"Conventional quantum error correcting codes require multiple rounds of measurements to detect errors with enough confidence in fault-tolerant scenarios. Here I show that for suitable topological codes a single round of local measurements is enough. This feature is generic and is related to self-correction and confinement phenomena in the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian model. 3D gauge color codes exhibit this single-shot feature, which applies also to initialization and gauge-fixing. Assuming the time for efficient classical computations negligible, this yields a topological fault-tolerant quantum computing scheme where all elementary logical operations can be performed in constant time."

We propose a phenomenological model for the resulting short-time dynamics that includes pair-creation, hopping, braiding, and fusion of anyons. By explicitly constructing topological quantum error-correcting codes for this class of system, we use our thermalization model to estimate the lifetime of the quantum information stored in the encoded spaces. To decode and correct errors in these codes, we adapt several existing topological decoders to the non-Abelian setting. We perform large-scale numerical simulations of these two-dimensional Ising anyon systems and find that the thresholds of these models range between 13% to 25%. To our knowledge, these are the first numerical threshold estimates for quantum codes without explicit additive structure."

Moreover, these bounds can be computed online---that is, while the experiment is running. We show numerically that these bounds are quite tight for relevant distributions of density matrices. We also show that the Bayesian mean estimator is ideal in the sense of performing close to the bound without requiring optimization. Our results hold for all finite dimensional quantum systems."

They are one of the most promising candidates for active error correction, not least due to a polynomial-time decoding algorithm which admits one of the highest predicted error thresholds. We consider the dependence of this threshold on underlying assumptions including different noise models, and analyze the performance of a minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoding compared to a mathematically optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Our ML algorithm tracks the success probabilities for all possible corrections over time and accounts for individual gate failure probabilities and error propagation due to the syndrome measurement circuit. We present the very first evidence for the true error threshold of an optimal circuit level decoder, allowing us to draw conclusions about what kind of improvements are possible over standard MWPM."
230,1503.04213,2015,3,3,30,Entropy power inequalities for qudits,Koenraad M R Audenaert;Nilanjana Datta;Maris Ozols,"Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI) can be viewed as a statement of concavity of an entropic function of a continuous random variable under a scaled addition rule: $$f(\sqrta\u2009X + \sqrt1-a\u2009Y) \ge a f(X) + (1-a) f(Y) \quad ∀\,a ∈[0,1].$$ Here, $X$ and $Y$ are continuous random variables and the function $f$ is either the differential entropy or the entropy power. König and Smith [arXiv:1205.3409] and De Palma, Mari, and Giovannetti [arXiv:1402.0404] obtained quantum analogues of these inequalities for continuous-variable quantum systems, where $X$ and $Y$ are replaced by bosonic fields and the addition rule is the action of a beamsplitter with transmissivity $a$ on those fields. In this paper, we similarly establish a class of EPI analogues for $d$-level quantum systems (i.e. qudits). The underlying addition rule for which these inequalities hold is given by a quantum channel that depends on the parameter $a \in [0,1]$ and acts like a finite-dimensional analogue of a beamsplitter with transmissivity $a$, converting a two-qudit product state into a single qudit state. We refer to this channel as a partial swap channel because of the particular way its output interpolates between the states of the two qudits in the input as $a$ is changed from zero to one. We obtain analogues of Shannon's EPI, not only for the von Neumann entropy and the entropy power for the output of such channels, but for a much larger class of functions as well. This class includes the Rényi entropies and the subentropy. We also prove a qudit analogue of the entropy photon number inequality (EPnI). Finally, for the subclass of partial swap channels for which one of the qudit states in the input is fixed, our EPIs and EPnI yield lower bounds on the minimum output entropy and upper bounds on the Holevo capacity."
231,1612.02058,2016,9,22,30,Error mitigation for short depth quantum circuits,Kristan Temme;Sergey Bravyi;Jay M Gambetta,"Two schemes are presented that mitigate the effect of errors and decoherence in short depth quantum circuits. The size of the circuits for which these techniques can be applied is limited by the rate at which the errors in the computation are introduced. Near term applications of early quantum devices, such as quantum simulations, rely on accurate estimates of expectation values to become relevant. Decoherence and gate errors lead to wrong estimates of the expectation values of observables used to evaluate the noisy circuit. The two schemes we discuss are deliberately simple and don't require additional qubit resources to be as practically relevant in current experiments as possible. The first method, extrapolation to the zero noise limit, subsequently cancels powers of the noise perturbations by an application of Richardson's deferred approach to the limit. The second method cancel errors by resampling randomized circuits according to a quasi-probability distribution."
232,1610.07244,2016,3,17,30,Power of one non-clean qubit,Tomoyuki Morimae;Keisuke Fujii;Harumichi Nishimura,"The one-clean qubit model (or the DQC1 model) is a restricted model of quantum computing where only a single qubit of the initial state is pure and others are maximally mixed. Although the model is not universal, it can efficiently solve several problems whose classical efficient solutions are not known. Furthermore, it was recently shown that if the one-clean qubit model is classically efficiently simulated, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. A disadvantage of the one-clean qubit model is, however, that the clean qubit is too clean: for example, in realistic NMR experiments, polarizations are not enough high to have the perfectly pure qubit. In this paper, we consider a more realistic one-clean qubit model, where the clean qubit is not clean, but depolarized. We first show that, for any polarization, a multiplicative-error calculation of the output probability distribution of the model is possible in a classical polynomial time if we take an appropriately large multiplicative error. The result is in a strong contrast to that of the ideal one-clean qubit model where the classical efficient multiplicative-error calculation (or even the sampling) with the same amount of error causes the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. We next show that, for any polarization lower-bounded by an inverse polynomial, a classical efficient sampling (in terms of a sufficiently small multiplicative error or an exponentially-small additive error) of the output probability distribution of the model is impossible unless BQP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, which suggests the hardness of the classical efficient simulation of the one non-clean qubit model."
233,1610.04670,2016,4,15,30,New Hardness Results for the Permanent Using Linear Optics,Daniel Grier;Luke Schaeffer,"In 2011, Aaronson gave a striking proof, based on quantum linear optics, showing that the problem of computing the permanent of a matrix is #P-hard. Aaronson's proof led naturally to hardness of approximation results for the permanent, and it was arguably simpler than Valiant's seminal proof of the same fact in 1979. Nevertheless, it did not prove that computing the permanent was #P-hard for any class of matrices which was not previously known. In this paper, we present a collection of new results about matrix permanents that are derived primarily via these linear optical techniques. First, we show that the problem of computing the permanent of a real orthogonal matrix is #P-hard. Much like Aaronson's original proof, this will show that even a multiplicative approximation remains #P-hard to compute. The hardness result even translates to permanents over finite fields, where the problem of computing the permanent of an orthogonal matrix is ModpP-hard in the finite field F_p^4 for all primes p not equal to 2 or 3. Interestingly, this characterization is tight: in fields of characteristic 2, the permanent coincides with the determinant; in fields of characteristic 3, one can efficiently compute the permanent of an orthogonal matrix by a nontrivial result of Kogan. Finally, we use more elementary arguments to prove #P-hardness for the permanent of a positive semidefinite matrix, which shows that certain probabilities of boson sampling experiments with thermal states are hard to compute exactly despite the fact that they can be efficiently sampled by a classical computer."
234,1609.00457,2016,12,8,30,Finding resource states of measurement-based quantum computing is harder than quantum computing,Tomoyuki Morimae,"Measurement-based quantum computing enables universal quantum computing with only adaptive single-qubit measurements on certain many-qubit states, such as the graph state, the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state, and several tensor-network states. Finding new resource states of measurement-based quantum computing is a hard task, since for a given state there are exponentially many possible measurement patterns on the state. In this paper, we consider the problem of deciding, for a given state and a set of unitary operators, whether there exists a way of measurement-based quantum computing on the state that can realize all unitaries in the set, or not. We show that the decision problem is QCMA-hard, which means that finding new resource states of measurement-based quantum computing is harder than quantum computing itself (unless BQP is equal to QCMA). We also derive an upperbound of the decision problem: the problem is in a quantum version of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy."
235,1605.03590,2016,10,25,30,Elucidating Reaction Mechanisms on Quantum Computers,Markus Reiher;Nathan Wiebe;Krysta M Svore;Dave Wecker;Matthias Troyer,"We show how a quantum computer can be employed to elucidate reaction mechanisms in complex chemical systems, using the open problem of biological nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase as an example. We discuss how quantum computers can augment classical-computer simulations for such problems, to significantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable simulations. Detailed resource estimates show that, even when taking into account the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in reasonable time on small quantum computers. This demonstrates that quantum computers will realistically be able to tackle important problems in chemistry that are both scientifically and economically significant."
236,1603.03717,2016,10,25,30,The Asymptotics of Quantum Max-Flow Min-Cut,Matthew B Hastings,"The quantum max-flow min-cut conjecture relates the rank of a tensor network to the minimum cut in the case that all tensors in the network are identical\citemfmc1. This conjecture was shown to be false in Ref. \onlinecitemfmc2 by an explicit counter-example. Here, we show that the conjecture is almost true, in that the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut converges to $1$ as the dimension $N$ of the degrees of freedom on the edges of the network tends to infinity. The proof is based on estimating moments of the singular values of the network. We introduce a generalization of ""rainbow diagrams""\citerainbow to tensor networks to estimate the dominant diagrams. A direct comparison of second and fourth moments lower bounds the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut by a constant. To show the tighter bound that the ratio tends to $1$, we consider higher moments. In addition, we show that the limiting moments as $N \rightarrow \infty$ agree with that in a different ensemble where tensors in the network are chosen independently, this is used to show that the distributions of singular values in the two different ensembles weakly converge to the same limiting distribution. We present also a numerical study of one particular tensor network, which shows a surprising dependence of the rank deficit on $N \mod 4$ and suggests further conjecture on the limiting behavior of the rank."
237,1603.02704,2016,10,18,30,Thresholds for universal concatenated quantum codes,Christopher Chamberland;Tomas Jochym-O'Connor;Raymond Laflamme,"Quantum error correction and fault-tolerance make it possible to perform quantum computations in the presence of imprecision and imperfections of realistic devices. An important question is to find the noise rate at which errors can be arbitrarily suppressed. By concatenating the 7-qubit Steane and 15-qubit Reed-Muller codes, the 105-qubit code enables a universal set of fault-tolerant gates despite not all of them being transversal. Importantly, the CNOT gate remains transversal in both codes, and as such has increased error protection relative to the other single qubit logical gates. We show that while the level-1 pseudo-threshold for the concatenated scheme is limited by the logical Hadamard, the error suppression of the logical CNOT gates allows for the asymptotic threshold to increase by orders of magnitude at higher levels. We establish a lower bound of $1.28~\times~10^{-3}$ for the asymptotic threshold of this code which is competitive with known concatenated models and does not rely on ancillary magic state preparation for universal computation."

The lemma provides an estimate on the error incurred by approximating the ground space projector with a product of local projectors. We provide a new, simpler proof for the detectability lemma, which applies to an arbitrary ordering of the local projectors, and show that it is tight up to a constant factor. As an application we show how the lemma can be combined with a strong converse by Gao to obtain local spectral gap amplification: we show that by coarse-graining a local frustration-free Hamiltonian with a spectral gap $\gamma>0$ to a length scale $O(\gamma^{-1/2})$, one gets an Hamiltonian with an $\Omega(1)$ spectral gap."
239,1512.04016,2015,9,5,30,Sculpting Quantum Speedups,Scott Aaronson;Shalev Ben-David,"Given a problem which is intractable for both quantum and classical algorithms, can we find a sub-problem for which quantum algorithms provide an exponential advantage? We refer to this problem as the ""sculpting problem."" In this work, we give a full characterization of sculptable functions in the query complexity setting. We show that a total function f can be restricted to a promise P such that Q(f|_P)=O(polylog(N)) and R(f|_P)=N^Omega(1), if and only if f has a large number of inputs with large certificate complexity. The proof uses some interesting techniques: for one direction, we introduce new relationships between randomized and quantum query complexity in various settings, and for the other direction, we use a recent result from communication complexity due to Klartag and Regev. We also characterize sculpting for other query complexity measures, such as R(f) vs. R_0(f) and R_0(f) vs. D(f). Along the way, we prove some new relationships for quantum query complexity: for example, a nearly quadratic relationship between Q(f) and D(f) whenever the promise of f is small. This contrasts with the recent super-quadratic query complexity separations, showing that the maximum gap between classical and quantum query complexities is indeed quadratic in various settings - just not for total functions! Lastly, we investigate sculpting in the Turing machine model. We show that if there is any BPP-bi-immune language in BQP, then every language outside BPP can be restricted to a promise which places it in PromiseBQP but not in PromiseBPP. Under a weaker assumption, that some problem in BQP is hard on average for P/poly, we show that every paddable language outside BPP is sculptable in this way."

Our method is robust to state preparation and measurement errors, and it achieves a quadratic speedup over conventional tomography when the unknown process is a generic unitary evolution. Our method is based on PhaseLift, a convex programming technique for phase retrieval. We show that this method achieves approximate recovery of almost all signals, using measurements sampled from spherical or unitary 2-designs. This is the first positive result on PhaseLift using 2-designs. We also show that exact recovery of all signals is possible using unitary 4-designs. Previous positive results for PhaseLift required spherical 4-designs, while PhaseLift was known to fail in certain cases when using spherical 2-designs."
241,1510.05245,2015,3,10,30,BosonSampling with Lost Photons,Scott Aaronson;Daniel J Brod,"BosonSampling is an intermediate model of quantum computation where linear-optical networks are used to solve sampling problems expected to be hard for classical computers. Since these devices are not expected to be universal for quantum computation, it remains an open question of whether any error-correction techniques can be applied to them, and thus it is important to investigate how robust the model is under natural experimental imperfections, such as losses and imperfect control of parameters. Here we investigate the complexity of BosonSampling under photon losses---more specifically, the case where an unknown subset of the photons are randomly lost at the sources. We show that, if $k$ out of $n$ photons are lost, then we cannot sample classically from a distribution that is $1/n^{\Theta(k)}$-close (in total variation distance) to the ideal distribution, unless a $\text{BPP}^{\text{NP}}$ machine can estimate the permanents of Gaussian matrices in $n^{O(k)}$ time. In particular, if $k$ is constant, this implies that simulating lossy BosonSampling is hard for a classical computer, under exactly the same complexity assumption used for the original lossless case."
242,1509.05065,2015,2,4,30,Estimating operator norms using covering nets,Fernando G S L Brandão;Aram W Harrow,"We present several polynomial- and quasipolynomial-time approximation schemes for a large class of generalized operator norms. Special cases include the $2\rightarrow q$ norm of matrices for $q>2$, the support function of the set of separable quantum states, finding the least noisy output of entanglement-breaking quantum channels, and approximating the injective tensor norm for a map between two Banach spaces whose factorization norm through $\ell_1^n$ is bounded. These reproduce and in some cases improve upon the performance of previous algorithms by Brandão-Christandl-Yard and followup work, which were based on the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy and whose analysis used techniques from quantum information such as the monogamy principle of entanglement. Our algorithms, by contrast, are based on brute force enumeration over carefully chosen covering nets. These have the advantage of using less memory, having much simpler proofs and giving new geometric insights into the problem. Net-based algorithms for similar problems were also presented by Shi-Wu and Barak-Kelner-Steurer, but in each case with a run-time that is exponential in the rank of some matrix. We achieve polynomial or quasipolynomial runtimes by using the much smaller nets that exist in $\ell_1$ spaces. This principle has been used in learning theory, where it is known as Maurey's empirical method."
243,1507.02642,2015,12,15,30,Quantum Inspired Training for Boltzmann Machines,Nathan Wiebe;Ashish Kapoor;Christopher E Granade;Krysta M Svore,"We present an efficient classical algorithm for training deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) that uses rejection sampling in concert with variational approximations to estimate the gradients of the training objective function. Our algorithm is inspired by a recent quantum algorithm for training DBMs. We obtain rigorous bounds on the errors in the approximate gradients; in turn, we find that choosing the instrumental distribution to minimize the alpha=2 divergence with the Gibbs state minimizes the asymptotic algorithmic complexity. Our rejection sampling approach can yield more accurate gradients than low-order contrastive divergence training and the costs incurred in finding increasingly accurate gradients can be easily parallelized. Finally our algorithm can train full Boltzmann machines and scales more favorably with the number of layers in a DBM than greedy contrastive divergence training."
244,1506.03808,2015,11,2,30,Classical codes in quantum state space,Mark Howard,"We present a construction of Hermitian operators and quantum states labelled by strings from a finite field. The distance between these operators or states is then simply related (typically, proportional) to the Hamming distance between their corresponding strings. This allows a straightforward application of classical coding theory to find arrangements of operators or states with a given distance distribution. Using the simplex or extended Reed-Solomon code in our construction recovers the discrete Wigner function, which has important applications in quantum information theory."

To this end we have developed quantum error-correcting codes to protect quantum information from noise. However, discovering codes that are capable of a universal set of computational operations with the minimal cost in quantum resources remains an important and ongoing challenge. One proposal of significant recent interest is the gauge color code. Notably, this code may offer a reduced resource cost over other well-studied fault-tolerant architectures using a new method, known as gauge fixing, for performing the non-Clifford logical operations that are essential for universal quantum computation. Here we examine the gauge color code when it is subject to noise. Specifically we make use of single-shot error correction to develop a simple decoding algorithm for the gauge color code, and we numerically analyse its performance. Remarkably, we find threshold error rates comparable to those of other leading proposals. Our results thus provide encouraging preliminary data of a comparative study between the gauge color code and other promising computational architectures."
246,1502.03450,2015,9,18,30,On the robustness of bucket brigade quantum RAM,Srinivasan Arunachalam;Vlad Gheorghiu;Tomas Jochym-O'Connor;Michele Mosca;Priyaa Varshinee Srinivasan,"We study the robustness of the bucket brigade quantum random access memory model introduced by Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160501 (2008)]. Due to a result of Regev and Schiff [ICALP '08 pp. 773], we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order $o(2^{-n/2})$ (where $N=2^n$ is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as an oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. By contrast, for algorithms such as matrix inversion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] or quantum machine learning [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 130503 (2014)] that only require a polynomial number of queries, the error rate only needs to be polynomially small and quantum error correction may not be required. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of ""active"" gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected."
247,1502.02987,2015,7,10,30,On zero-error communication via quantum channels in the presence of noiseless feedback,Runyao Duan;Simone Severini;Andreas Winter,"We initiate the study of zero-error communication via quantum channels when the receiver and sender have at their disposal a noiseless feedback channel of unlimited quantum capacity, generalizing Shannon's zero-error communication theory with instantaneous feedback. We first show that this capacity is a function only of the linear span of Choi-Kraus operators of the channel, which generalizes the bipartite equivocation graph of a classical channel, and which we dub ""non-commutative bipartite graph"". Then we go on to show that the feedback-assisted capacity is non-zero (with constant activating noiseless communication) if and only if the non-commutative bipartite graph is non-trivial, and give a number of equivalent characterizations. This result involves a far-reaching extension of the ""conclusive exclusion"" of quantum states [Pusey/Barrett/Rudolph, Nature Phys. 8:475-478]. We then present an upper bound on the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity, motivated by a conjecture originally made by Shannon and proved later by Ahlswede. We demonstrate this bound to have many good properties, including being additive and given by a minimax formula. We also prove that this quantity is the entanglement-assisted capacity against an adversarially chosen channel from the set of all channels with the same Choi-Kraus span, which can also be interpreted as the feedback-assisted unambiguous capacity. The proof relies on a generalization of the ""Postselection Lemma"" [Christandl/Koenig/Renner, PRL 102:020504] that allows to reflect additional constraints, and which we believe to be of independent interest. We illustrate our ideas with a number of examples, including classical-quantum channels and Weyl diagonal channels, and close with an extensive discussion of open questions."
248,1412.0980,2014,6,12,30,Approximate Degradable Quantum Channels,David Sutter;Volkher B Scholz;Andreas Winter;Renato Renner,"Degradable quantum channels are an important class of completely positive trace-preserving maps. Among other properties, they offer a single-letter formula for the quantum and the private classical capacity and are characterized by the fact that the complementary channel can be obtained from the channel by applying a degrading map. In this work we introduce the concept of approximate degradable channels, which satisfy this condition up to some finite $\varepsilon\geq 0$. That is, there exists a degrading map which upon composition with the channel is $\varepsilon$-close in the diamond norm to the complementary channel. We show that for any fixed channel the smallest such $\varepsilon$ can be efficiently determined via a semidefinite program. Moreover, these approximate degradable channels also approximately inherit all other properties of degradable channels. As an application, we derive improved upper bounds to the quantum and private classical capacity for certain channels of interest in quantum communication."
249,1410.7411,2014,3,31,30,Ground state entanglement constrains low-energy excitations,Isaac H Kim;Benjamin J Brown,"For a general quantum many-body system, we show that its ground-state entanglement imposes a fundamental constraint on the low-energy excitations. For two-dimensional systems, our result implies that any system that supports anyons must have a nonvanishing topological entanglement entropy. We demonstrate the generality of this argument by applying it to three-dimensional quantum many-body systems, and showing that there is a pair of ground state topological invariants that are associated to their physical boundaries. From the pair, one can determine whether the given boundary can or cannot absorb point-like or line-like excitations."
250,1408.6829,2014,2,13,30,Quantum de Finetti theorem under fully-one-way adaptive measurements,Ke Li;Graeme Smith,"We prove a version of the quantum de Finetti theorem: permutation-invariant quantum states are well approximated as a probabilistic mixture of multi-fold product states. The approximation is measured by distinguishability under fully one-way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) measurements. Our result strengthens Brandão and Harrow's de Finetti theorem where a kind of partially one-way LOCC measurements was used for measuring the approximation, with essentially the same error bound. As main applications, we show (i) a quasipolynomial-time algorithm which detects multipartite entanglement with amount larger than an arbitrarily small constant (measured with a variant of the relative entropy of entanglement), and (ii) a proof that in quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems, polynomially many provers are not more powerful than a single prover when the verifier is restricted to one-way LOCC operations."
251,1404.3236,2014,2,11,30,Extending Noether's theorem by quantifying the asymmetry of quantum states,Iman Marvian;Robert W Spekkens,"Noether's theorem is a fundamental result in physics stating that every symmetry of the dynamics implies a conservation law. It is, however, deficient in several respects: (i) it is not applicable to dynamics wherein the system interacts with an environment, and (ii) even in the case where the system is isolated, if the quantum state is mixed then the Noether conservation laws do not capture all of the consequences of the symmetries. To address these deficiencies, we introduce measures of the extent to which a quantum state breaks a symmetry. Such measures yield novel constraints on state transitions: for nonisolated systems, they cannot increase, while for isolated systems they are conserved. We demonstrate that the problem of finding nontrivial asymmetry measures can be solved using the tools of quantum information theory. Applications include deriving model-independent bounds on the quantum noise in amplifiers and assessing quantum schemes for achieving high-precision metrology."
252,1403.4621,2014,12,3,30,Almost quantum correlations,Miguel Navascués;Yelena Guryanova;Matty J Hoban;Antonio Acín,"There have been a number of attempts to derive the set of quantum non-local correlations from reasonable physical principles. Here we introduce $\tilde{Q}$, a set of multipartite supra-quantum correlations that has appeared under different names in fields as diverse as graph theory, quantum gravity and quantum information science. We argue that $\tilde{Q}$ may correspond to the set of correlations of a reasonable physical theory, in which case the research program to reconstruct quantum theory from device-independent principles is met with strong obstacles. In support of this conjecture, we prove that $\tilde{Q}$ is closed under classical operations and satisfies the physical principles of Non-Trivial Communication Complexity, No Advantage for Nonlocal Computation, Macroscopic Locality and Local Orthogonality. We also review numerical evidence that almost quantum correlations satisfy Information Causality."
253,1401.4174,2014,10,29,30,Contextuality supplies the magic for quantum computation,Mark Howard;Joel J Wallman;Victor Veitch;Joseph Emerson,"Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the answer to the most basic question ""What is the source of the power in quantum computing?"" has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via magic state distillation. This is a conceptually satisfying link because contextuality provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena and, moreover, magic state distillation is the leading model for experimentally realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the nonlocality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality and nonlocality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation and bounding the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms."
254,1311.0885,2013,9,9,30,Homological Product Codes,Sergey Bravyi;Matthew B Hastings,"Quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers known as LDPC codes have been actively studied recently due to their simple syndrome readout circuits and potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, all families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance scaling limited by the square-root of the code length. This is in a sharp contrast with the classical case where good families of LDPC codes are known that combine constant encoding rate and linear distance. Here we propose the first family of good quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes have a constant encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at most $\sqrt{n}$ qubits, where $n$ is the code length. For comparison, all previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers of linear weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions of good quantum codes and the homological product operation from algebraic topology. We conjecture that similar methods can produce good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight $n^a$ for any $a>0$. Finally, we apply the homological product to construct new small codes with low-weight stabilizers."
255,1310.0017,2013,8,29,30,Product-state Approximations to Quantum Ground States,Fernando G S L Brandão;Aram W Harrow,"The local Hamiltonian problem consists of estimating the ground-state energy (given by the minimum eigenvalue) of a local quantum Hamiltonian. First, we show the existence of a good product-state approximation for the ground-state energy of 2-local Hamiltonians with one or more of the following properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state with sublinear entanglement with respect to some partition into small pieces. The approximation based on degree is a surprising difference between quantum Hamiltonians and classical CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems), since in the classical setting, higher degree is usually associated with harder CSPs. The approximation based on low entanglement, in turn, was previously known only in the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Since the existence of a low-energy product state can be checked in NP, the result implies that any Hamiltonian used for a quantum PCP theorem should have: (1) constant degree, (2) constant expansion, (3) a ""volume law"" for entanglement with respect to any partition into small parts. Second, we show that in several cases, good product-state approximations not only exist, but can be found in polynomial time: (1) 2-local Hamiltonians on any planar graph, solving an open problem of Bansal, Bravyi, and Terhal, (2) dense k-local Hamiltonians for any constant k, solving an open problem of Gharibian and Kempe, and (3) 2-local Hamiltonians on graphs with low threshold rank, via a quantum generalization of a recent result of Barak, Raghavendra and Steurer. Our work introduces two new tools which may be of independent interest. First, we prove a new quantum version of the de Finetti theorem which does not require the usual assumption of symmetry. Second, we describe a way to analyze the application of the Lasserre/Parrilo SDP hierarchy to local quantum Hamiltonians."

We show that this class can be exactly characterized by PSPACE, the class of problems solvable with a polynomial amount of memory. As applications we show that a ""precise"" version of the Local Hamiltonian problem is PSPACE-complete, and give a provable setting in which the ability to prepare PEPS states is not as powerful as the ability to prepare the ground state of general Local Hamiltonians."
257,1312.2496,2013,3,20,29,On the hardness of classically simulating the one clean qubit model,Tomoyuki Morimae;Keisuke Fujii;Joseph F Fitzsimons,"Deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit (DQC1) is a model of quantum computing where the input restricted to containing a single qubit in a pure state and with all other qubits in a completely-mixed state, with only a single qubit measurement at the end of the computation [E. Knill and R. Laflamme, Phys. Rev. Lett. \bf81, 5672 (1998)]. While it is known that DQC1 can efficiently solve several problems for which no known classical efficient algorithms exist, the question of whether DQC1 is really more powerful than classical computation remains open. In this paper, we introduce a slightly modified version of DQC1, which we call DQC1$_k$, where $k$ output qubits are measured, and show that DQC1$_k$ cannot be classically efficiently simulated for any $k\geq3$ unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses at the third level."
258,1310.7596,2013,3,13,29,Fault-Tolerant Measurement-Based Quantum Computing with Continuous-Variable Cluster States,Nicolas C Menicucci,"A long-standing open question about Gaussian continuous-variable cluster states is whether they enable fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation. The answer is yes. Initial squeezing in the cluster above a threshold value of 20.5 dB ensures that errors from finite squeezing acting on encoded qubits are below the fault-tolerance threshold of known qubit-based error-correcting codes. By concatenating with one of these codes and using ancilla-based error correction, fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation of theoretically indefinite length is possible with finitely squeezed cluster states."
259,1404.1507,2014,1,18,29,An adaptive attack on Wiesner's quantum money,Aharon Brodutch;Daniel Nagaj;Or Sattath;Dominique Unruh,"Unlike classical money, which is hard to forge for practical reasons (e.g. producing paper with a certain property), quantum money is attractive because its security might be based on the no-cloning theorem. The first quantum money scheme was introduced by Wiesner circa 1970. Although more sophisticated quantum money schemes were proposed, Wiesner's scheme remained appealing because it is both conceptually clean and relatively easy to implement. We show efficient adaptive attacks on Wiesner's quantum money scheme [Wie83] (and its variant by Bennett et al. [BBBW83]), when valid money is accepted and passed on, while invalid money is destroyed. We propose two attacks, the first is inspired by the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb testing problem [EV93, KWH+95], while the second is based on the idea of protective measurements [AAV93]. It allows us to break Wiesner's scheme with 4 possible states per qubit, and generalizations which use more than 4 states per qubit."
260,1403.1539,2014,11,6,29,Improving Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Chemistry,Matthew B Hastings;David Wecker;Bela Bauer;Matthias Troyer,"We present several improvements to the standard Trotter-Suzuki based algorithms used in the simulation of quantum chemistry on a quantum computer. First, we modify how Jordan-Wigner transformations are implemented to reduce their cost from linear or logarithmic in the number of orbitals to a constant. Our modification does not require additional ancilla qubits. Then, we demonstrate how many operations can be parallelized, leading to a further linear decrease in the parallel depth of the circuit, at the cost of a small constant factor increase in number of qubits required. Thirdly, we modify the term order in the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, significantly reducing the error at given Trotter-Suzuki timestep. A final improvement modifies the Hamiltonian to reduce errors introduced by the non-zero Trotter-Suzuki timestep. All of these techniques are validated using numerical simulation and detailed gate counts are given for realistic molecules."

Though transversal gates alone cannot be computationally universal, they can be combined with specially distilled resource states in order to achieve universality. We show that ""triorthogonal"" stabilizer codes, introduced for state distillation by Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], admit transversal implementation of the controlled-controlled-Z gate. We then construct a universal set of fault-tolerant gates without state distillation by using only transversal controlled-controlled-Z, transversal Hadamard, and fault-tolerant error correction. We also adapt the distillation procedure of Bravyi and Haah to Toffoli gates, improving on existing Toffoli distillation schemes."

We then define the notions of quantum and non-signalling isomorphism, by considering perfect quantum and non-signalling strategies for the $(G,H)$-isomorphism game, respectively. First, we prove that non-signalling isomorphism coincides with the well-studied notion of fractional isomorphism, thus giving the latter an operational interpretation. Second, we show that quantum isomorphism is equivalent to the feasibility of two polynomial systems in non-commuting variables, obtained by relaxing the standard integer programming formulations for graph isomorphism to Hermitian variables. On the basis of this correspondence, we show that quantum isomorphic graphs are necessarily cospectral. Finally, we provide a construction for producing quantum isomorphic graphs that are nevertheless not isomorphic. Our construction makes use of linear binary constraint system games and is related to the FGLSS reduction of inapproximability literature."
263,1611.05411,2016,12,10,29,Capacity estimation and verification of quantum channels with arbitrarily correlated errors,Corsin Pfister;M Adriaan Rol;Atul Mantri;Marco Tomamichel;Stephanie Wehner,"One of the main figures of merit for quantum memories and quantum communication devices is their quantum capacity. It has been studied for arbitrary kinds of quantum channels, but its practical estimation has so far been limited to devices that implement independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) quantum channels, where each qubit is affected by the same noise process. Real devices, however, typically exhibit correlated errors. Here, we overcome this limitation by presenting protocols that estimate a channel's one-shot quantum capacity for the case where the device acts on (an arbitrary number of) qubits. The one-shot quantum capacity quantifies a device's ability to store or communicate quantum information, even if there are correlated errors across the different qubits. We present a protocol which is easy to implement and which comes in two versions. The first version estimates the one-shot quantum capacity by preparing and measuring in two different bases, where all involved qubits are used as test qubits. The second version verifies on-the-fly that a channel's one-shot quantum capacity exceeds a minimal tolerated value while storing or communicating data, therefore combining test qubits and data qubits in one protocol. We discuss the performance of our method using simple examples, such as the dephasing channel for which our method is asymptotically optimal. Finally, we apply our method to estimate the one-shot capacity in an experiment using a transmon qubit."

Howard, Wallman, Veitch and Emerson proved recently that these two notions coincide for qudits in odd prime dimension. This equivalence is particularly important since it promotes contextuality as a ressource that magic states must possess in order to allow for a quantum speed-up. We propose a simple proof of the equivalence between contextuality and negativity of the Wigner function based on character theory. This simplified approach allows us to generalize this equivalence to multiple qudits and to any qudit system of odd local dimension."

Analyzing this experimental data in a robust and reproducible manner is made challenging, however, by the lack of readily-available software for performing principled statistical analysis. We improve the robustness and reproducibility of characterization by introducing an open-source library, QInfer, to address this need. Our library makes it easy to analyze data from tomography, randomized benchmarking, and Hamiltonian learning experiments either in post-processing, or online as data is acquired. QInfer also provides functionality for predicting the performance of proposed experimental protocols from simulated runs. By delivering easy- to-use characterization tools based on principled statistical analysis, QInfer helps address many outstanding challenges facing quantum technology."
266,1609.08595,2016,3,7,29,Distinguishing quantum states using Clifford orbits,Richard Kueng;Huangjun Zhu;David Gross,"It is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics that information is lost as a result of performing measurements. Indeed, with every quantum measurement one can associate a number -- its POVM norm constant -- that quantifies how much the distinguishability of quantum states degrades in the worst case as a result of the measurement. This raises the obvious question which measurements preserve the most information in these sense of having the largest norm constant. While a number of near-optimal schemes have been found (e.g. the uniform POVM, or complex projective 4-designs), they all seem to be difficult to implement in practice. Here, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum states under measurements that are orbits of the Clifford group. The Clifford group plays an important role e.g. in quantum error correction, and its elements are considered simple to implement. We find that the POVM norm constants of Clifford orbits depend on the effective rank of the states that should be distinguished, as well as on a quantitative measure of the ""degree of localization in phase space"" of the vectors in the orbit. The most important Clifford orbit is formed by the set of stabilizer states. Our main result implies that stabilizer measurements are essentially optimal for distinguishing pure quantum states. As an auxiliary result, we use the methods developed here to prove new entropic uncertainty relations for stabilizer measurements. This paper is based on a very recent analysis of the representation theory of tensor powers of the Clifford group."

This allows for the classification of two dimensional fermionic topological phases in terms of matrix product operator algebras. Using this approach we give a classification of fermionic symmetry protected topological phases with respect to a group $G$ in terms of three cohomology groups: $H^1(G,Z_2)$, describing which matrix product operators are of Majorana type, $H^2(G,Z_2)$, describing the fermionic nature of the fusion tensors that arise when two matrix product operators are multiplied, and the supercohomolgy group $\bar{H}^3(G,U(1))$ which corresponds to the associator that changes the order of fusion. We also generalize the tensor network description of the string-net ground states to the fermionic setting, yielding simple representations of a class that includes the fermionic toric code."

We give a complete characterization of the diagonal gates in the Clifford hierarchy for prime-dimensional qudits. They turn out to be $p^{m}$-th roots of unity raised to polynomial functions of the basis state to which they are applied, and we determine which level of the Clifford hierarchy a given gate sits in based on $m$ and the degree of the polynomial."

Quantum compressed sensing mitigates this problem by reconstructing the state from an incomplete set of observables. In this work, we present an experimental implementation of compressed tomography of a seven qubit system---the largest-scale realization to date---and we introduce new numerical methods in order to scale the reconstruction to this dimension. Originally, compressed sensing has been advocated for density matrices with few non-zero eigenvalues. Here, we argue that the low-rank estimates provided by compressed sensing can be appropriate even in the general case. The reason is that statistical noise often allows only for the leading eigenvectors to be reliably reconstructed: We find that the remaining eigenvectors behave in a way consistent with a random matrix model that carries no information about the true state. We report a reconstruction of quantum states from a topological color code of seven qubits, prepared in a trapped ion architecture, based on tomographically incomplete data involving 127 Pauli basis measurement settings only, repeated 100 times each."

Initially, one performs several rounds of distillation to create high-fidelity magic states that provide one good T-gate, an essential quantum logic gate. Subsequently, gate synthesis intersperses many T-gates with Clifford gates to realise a desired circuit. We introduce a unified framework that implements one round of distillation and multi-qubit gate synthesis in a single step. Typically, our method uses the same number of T-gates as conventional synthesis, but with the added benefit of quadratic error suppression. Because of this, one less round of magic state distillation needs to be performed, leading to significant resource savings."

We give the first super-quadratic separation between quantum and randomized communication complexity for a total function, giving an example exhibiting a power 2.5 gap. We further present a 1.5 power separation between exact quantum and randomized communication complexity, improving on the previous ~1.15 separation by Ambainis (STOC 2013). Finally, we present a nearly optimal quadratic separation between randomized communication complexity and the logarithm of the partition number, improving upon the previous best power 1.5 separation due to Göös, Jayram, Pitassi, and Watson. Our results are the communication analogues of separations in query complexity proved using the recent cheat sheet framework of Aaronson, Ben-David, and Kothari (STOC 2016). Our main technical results are randomized communication and information complexity lower bounds for a family of functions, called lookup functions, that generalize and port the cheat sheet framework to communication complexity."
272,1604.00354,2016,8,24,29,Bit threads and holographic entanglement,Michael H Freedman;Matthew Headrick,"The Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula relates the entanglement entropy of a region in a holographic theory to the area of a corresponding bulk minimal surface. Using the max flow-min cut principle, a theorem from network theory, we rewrite the RT formula in a way that does not make reference to the minimal surface. Instead, we invoke the notion of a ""flow"", defined as a divergenceless norm-bounded vector field, or equivalently a set of Planck-thickness ""bit threads"". The entanglement entropy of a boundary region is given by the maximum flux out of it of any flow, or equivalently the maximum number of bit threads that can emanate from it. The threads thus represent entanglement between points on the boundary, and naturally implement the holographic principle. As we explain, this new picture clarifies several conceptual puzzles surrounding the RT formula. We give flow-based proofs of strong subadditivity and related properties; unlike the ones based on minimal surfaces, these proofs correspond in a transparent manner to the properties' information-theoretic meanings. We also briefly discuss certain technical advantages that the flows offer over minimal surfaces. In a mathematical appendix, we review the max flow-min cut theorem on networks and on Riemannian manifolds, and prove in the network case that the set of max flows varies Lipshitz continuously in the network parameters."

They have been used to construct explicit toy models realizing many interesting structural features of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator reconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the holographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models naturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT correspondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that the entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties of the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each boundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement wedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the partition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the minimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the analog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and the entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the entanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface topologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole. Extrapolating bulk correlation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling dimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small number of low-dimension operators and the rest. While we are primarily motivated by AdS/CFT duality, our main results define a more general form of bulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to other spacetimes."
274,1512.00088,2015,7,1,29,Local gap threshold for frustration-free spin systems,David Gosset;Evgeny Mozgunov,"We improve Knabe's spectral gap bound for frustration-free translation-invariant local Hamiltonians in 1D. The bound is based on a relationship between global and local gaps. The global gap is the spectral gap of a size-$m$ chain with periodic boundary conditions, while the local gap is that of a subchain of size $n<m$ with open boundary conditions. Knabe proved that if the local gap is larger than the threshold value $1/(n-1)$ for some $n>2$, then the global gap is lower bounded by a positive constant in the thermodynamic limit $m\rightarrow \infty$. Here we improve the threshold to $\frac{6}{n(n+1)}$, which is better (smaller) for all $n>3$ and which is asymptotically optimal. As a corollary we establish a surprising fact about 1D translation-invariant frustration-free systems that are gapless in the thermodynamic limit: for any such system the spectral gap of a size-$n$ chain with open boundary conditions is upper bounded as $O(n^{-2})$. This contrasts with gapless frustrated systems where the gap can be $\Theta(n^{-1})$. It also limits the extent to which the area law is violated in these frustration-free systems, since it implies that the half-chain entanglement entropy is $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ as a function of spectral gap $\epsilon$. We extend our results to frustration-free systems on a 2D square lattice."

A ground state of a (geometrically) local Hamiltonian with spectral gap $\epsilon$ has correlation length $\xi$ upper bounded as $\xi=O(1/\epsilon)$. In general this bound cannot be improved. Here we study the scaling of the correlation length as a function of the spectral gap in frustration-free local Hamiltonians, and we prove a tight bound $\xi=O(1/\sqrt\epsilon)$ in this setting. This highlights a fundamental difference between frustration-free and frustrated systems near criticality. The result is obtained using an improved version of the combinatorial proof of correlation decay due to Aharonov, Arad, Vazirani, and Landau."

For a given fixed average error rate, coherent noise mechanisms will generally lead to a larger worst-case error than incoherent noise. We show that the coherence of a noise source can be quantified by the unitarity, which we relate to the average change in purity averaged over input pure states. We then show that the unitarity can be efficiently estimated using a protocol based on randomized benchmarking that is efficient and robust to state-preparation and measurement errors. We also show that the unitarity provides a lower bound on the optimal achievable gate infidelity under a given noisy process."
277,1412.7437,2014,5,5,29,Compressibility of positive semidefinite factorizations and quantum models,Cyril J Stark;Aram W Harrow,We investigate compressibility of the dimension of positive semidefinite matrices while approximately preserving their pairwise inner products. This can either be regarded as compression of positive semidefinite factorizations of nonnegative matrices or (if the matrices are subject to additional normalization constraints) as compression of quantum models. We derive both lower and upper bounds on compressibility. Applications are broad and range from the statistical analysis of experimental data to bounding the one-way quantum communication complexity of Boolean functions.
278,1412.0732,2014,4,4,29,Tensor Network Renormalization,Glen Evenbly;Guifre Vidal,"We introduce a coarse-graining transformation for tensor networks that can be applied to study both the partition function of a classical statistical system and the Euclidean path integral of a quantum many-body system. The scheme is based upon the insertion of optimized unitary and isometric tensors (disentanglers and isometries) into the tensor network and has, as its key feature, the ability to remove short-range entanglement/correlations at each coarse-graining step. Removal of short-range entanglement results in scale invariance being explicitly recovered at criticality. In this way we obtain a proper renormalization group flow (in the space of tensors), one that in particular (i) is computationally sustainable, even for critical systems, and (ii) has the correct structure of fixed points, both at criticality and away from it. We demonstrate the proposed approach in the context of the 2D classical Ising model."

Here, invoking a recent inequality for the quantum conditional mutual information [Fawzi/Renner, arXiv:1410.0664, greatly extended and simplified in various work since, up to the most recent contributions of Wilde, arXiv:1505.04661 and Sutter/Tomamichel/Harrow, arXiv:1507.00303], we show the converse, that a small value of squashed entanglement implies that the state is close to a highly extendible state. As a corollary, we establish an alternative proof of the faithfulness of squashed entanglement [Brandao/Christandl/Yard, CMP 306:805-830 (2011)]. We briefly discuss the previous and subsequent history of the Fawzi-Renner bound and related conjectures, and close by advertising a potentially far-reaching generalization to universal and functorial recovery maps for the monotonicity of the relative entropy."

The formalism of projected entangled-pair states is a natural framework for the parameterization of the corresponding ground state wavefunctions, in which the full wavefunction is encoded in terms of local tensors. Topological order is reflected in the symmetries of these tensors, and we give a characterization of those symmetries in terms of matrix product operators acting on the virtual level. This leads to a set of algebraic rules characterizing states with topological quantum order. The corresponding matrix product operators fully encode all topological features of the theory, and provide a systematic way of constructing topological states. We generalize the conditions of $\mathsf{G}$ and twisted injectivity to the matrix product operator case, and provide a complete picture of the ground state manifold on the torus. As an example, we show how all string-net models of Levin and Wen fit within this formalism, and in doing so provide a particularly intuitive interpretation of the pentagon equation for F-symbols as the pulling of certain matrix product operators through the string-net tensor network. Our approach paves the way to finding novel topological phases beyond string-nets, and elucidates the description of topological phases in terms of entanglement Hamiltonians and edge theories."
282,1408.0945,2014,3,30,29,What does an experimental test of quantum contextuality prove or disprove?,Andreas Winter,"The possibility to test experimentally the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem is investigated critically, following the demonstrations by Meyer, Kent and Clifton-Kent that the predictions of quantum mechanics are indistinguishable (up to arbitrary precision) from those of a non-contextual model, and the subsequent debate to which extent these models are actually classical or non-contextual. The present analysis starts from a careful consideration these ""finite-precision"" approximations. A stronger condition for non-contextual models, dubbed <ontological faithfulness>, is exhibited. It is shown that it allows to formulate approximately the constraints in Bell-Kochen-Specker theorems such as to render the usual proofs robust. As a consequence, one can experimentally test to finite precision ontologically faithful non-contextuality, and thus experimentally refute explanations from this smaller class. We include a discussion of the relation of ontological faithfulness to other proposals to overcome the finite precision objection."
283,1403.2734,2014,12,24,29,Fault-tolerant conversion between the Steane and Reed-Muller quantum codes,Jonas T Anderson;Guillaume Duclos-Cianci;David Poulin,"Steane's 7-qubit quantum error-correcting code admits a set of fault-tolerant gates that generate the Clifford group, which in itself is not universal for quantum computation. The 15-qubit Reed-Muller code also does not admit a universal fault-tolerant gate set but possesses fault-tolerant T and control-control-Z gates. Combined with the Clifford group, either of these two gates generate a universal set. Here, we combine these two features by demonstrating how to fault-tolerantly convert between these two codes, providing a new method to realize universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. One interpretation of our result is that both codes correspond to the same subsystem code in different gauges. Our scheme extends to the entire family of quantum Reed-Muller codes."
284,1402.7166,2014,12,3,29,A simpler proof of existence of quantum weak coin flipping with arbitrarily small bias,Dorit Aharonov;André Chailloux;Maor Ganz;Iordanis Kerenidis;Loïck Magnin,"Mochon's proof [Moc07] of existence of quantum weak coin flipping with arbitrarily small bias is a fundamental result in quantum cryptography, but at the same time one of the least understood. Though used several times as a black box in important follow-up results [Gan09, CK09, AS10, CK11, KZ13] the result has not been peer-reviewed, its novel techniques (and in particular Kitaev's point game formalism) have not been applied anywhere else, and an explicit protocol is missing. We believe that truly understanding the existence proof and the novel techniques it relies on would constitute a major step in quantum information theory, leading to deeper understanding of entanglement and of quantum protocols in general. In this work, we make a first step in this direction. We simplify parts of Mochon's construction considerably, making about 20 pages of analysis in the original proof superfluous, clarifying some other parts of the proof on the way, and presenting the proof in a way which is conceptually easier to grasp. We believe the resulting proof of existence is easier to understand, more readable, and certainly verifiable. Moreover, we analyze the resources needed to achieve a bias $\epsilon$ and show that the number of qubits is $O(\log 1/\epsilon)$, while the number of rounds is $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$. A true understanding of the proof, including Kitaev's point game techniques and their applicability, as well as completing the task of constructing an explicit (and also simpler and more efficient) protocol, are left to future work."
285,1408.1816,2014,11,5,28,Quantum pattern matching fast on average,Ashley Montanaro,"The $d$-dimensional pattern matching problem is to find an occurrence of a pattern of length $m \times \dots \times m$ within a text of length $n \times \dots \times n$, with $n \ge m$. This task models various problems in text and image processing, among other application areas. This work describes a quantum algorithm which solves the pattern matching problem for random patterns and texts in time $\widetilde{O}((n/m)^{d/2} 2^{O(d^{3/2}\sqrt{\log m})})$. For large $m$ this is super-polynomially faster than the best possible classical algorithm, which requires time $\widetilde{\Omega}( (n/m)^d + n^{d/2} )$. The algorithm is based on the use of a quantum subroutine for finding hidden shifts in $d$ dimensions, which is a variant of algorithms proposed by Kuperberg."
286,1602.05973,2016,10,16,28,Breaking Symmetric Cryptosystems using Quantum Period Finding,Marc Kaplan;Gaëtan Leurent;Anthony Leverrier;María Naya-Plasencia,"Due to Shor's algorithm, quantum computers are a severe threat for public key cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a lot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless possible to build secure cryptosystems in it. We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen with some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the quantum model. We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ, COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are secure with a quantum-secure PRF. Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks, leading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis technique in the quantum model."
287,1611.08946,2016,8,6,28,Exponential Separation of Quantum Communication and Classical Information,Anurag Anshu;Dave Touchette;Penghui Yao;Nengkun Yu,"We exhibit a Boolean function for which the quantum communication complexity is exponentially larger than the classical information complexity. An exponential separation in the other direction was already known from the work of Kerenidis et. al. [SICOMP 44, pp. 1550-1572], hence our work implies that these two complexity measures are incomparable. As classical information complexity is an upper bound on quantum information complexity, which in turn is equal to amortized quantum communication complexity, our work implies that a tight direct sum result for distributional quantum communication complexity cannot hold. The function we use to present such a separation is the Symmetric k-ary Pointer Jumping function introduced by Rao and Sinha [ECCC TR15-057], whose classical communication complexity is exponentially larger than its classical information complexity. In this paper, we show that the quantum communication complexity of this function is polynomially equivalent to its classical communication complexity. The high-level idea behind our proof is arguably the simplest so far for such an exponential separation between information and communication, driven by a sequence of round-elimination arguments, allowing us to simplify further the approach of Rao and Sinha. As another application of the techniques that we develop, we give a simple proof for an optimal trade-off between Alice's and Bob's communication while computing the related Greater-Than function on n bits: say Bob communicates at most b bits, then Alice must send n/exp(O(b)) bits to Bob. This holds even when allowing pre-shared entanglement. We also present a classical protocol achieving this bound."
288,1610.08070,2016,3,3,28,Low rank matrix recovery from Clifford orbits,Richard Kueng;Huangjun Zhu;David Gross,"We prove that low-rank matrices can be recovered efficiently from a small number of measurements that are sampled from orbits of a certain matrix group. As a special case, our theory makes statements about the phase retrieval problem. Here, the task is to recover a vector given only the amplitudes of its inner product with a small number of vectors from an orbit. Variants of the group in question have appeared under different names in many areas of mathematics. In coding theory and quantum information, it is the complex Clifford group; in time-frequency analysis the oscillator group; and in mathematical physics the metaplectic group. It affords one particularly small and highly structured orbit that includes and generalizes the discrete Fourier basis: While the Fourier vectors have coefficients of constant modulus and phases that depend linearly on their index, the vectors in said orbit have phases with a quadratic dependence. In quantum information, the orbit is used extensively and is known as the set of stabilizer states. We argue that due to their rich geometric structure and their near-optimal recovery properties, stabilizer states form an ideal model for structured measurements for phase retrieval. Our results hold for $m\geq C \kappa_r r d \log(d)$ measurements, where the oversampling factor k varies between $\kappa_r=1$ and $\kappa_r = r^2$ depending on the orbit. The reconstruction is stable towards both additive noise and deviations from the assumption of low rank. If the matrices of interest are in addition positive semidefinite, reconstruction may be performed by a simple constrained least squares regression. Our proof methods could be adapted to cover orbits of other groups."
289,1609.05507,2016,12,18,28,Computability Theory of Closed Timelike Curves,Scott Aaronson;Mohammad Bavarian;Giulio Gueltrini,"We ask, and answer, the question of what's computable by Turing machines equipped with time travel into the past: that is, closed timelike curves or CTCs (with no bound on their size). We focus on a model for CTCs due to Deutsch, which imposes a probabilistic consistency condition to avoid grandfather paradoxes. Our main result is that computers with CTCs can solve exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem, and that this is true whether we consider classical or quantum computers. Previous work, by Aaronson and Watrous, studied CTC computers with a polynomial size restriction, and showed that they solve exactly the problems in PSPACE, again in both the classical and quantum cases. Compared to the complexity setting, the main novelty of the computability setting is that not all CTCs have fixed-points, even probabilistically. Despite this, we show that the CTCs that do have fixed-points suffice to solve the halting problem, by considering fixed-point distributions involving infinite geometric series. The tricky part is to show that even quantum computers with CTCs can be simulated using a Halt oracle. For that, we need the Riesz representation theorem from functional analysis, among other tools. We also study an alternative model of CTCs, due to Lloyd et al., which uses postselection to ""simulate"" a consistency condition, and which yields BPP_path in the classical case or PP in the quantum case when subject to a polynomial size restriction. With no size limit, we show that postselected CTCs yield only the computable languages if we impose a certain finiteness condition, or all languages nonadaptively reducible to the halting problem if we don't."
290,1608.06991,2016,8,11,28,Gaussian hypothesis testing and quantum illumination,Mark M Wilde;Marco Tomamichel;Seth Lloyd;Mario Berta,"Quantum hypothesis testing is one of the most basic tasks in quantum information theory and has fundamental links with quantum communication and estimation theory. In this paper, we establish a formula that characterizes the decay rate of the minimal Type-II error probability in a quantum hypothesis test of two Gaussian states given a fixed constraint on the Type-I error probability. This formula is a direct function of the mean vectors and covariance matrices of the quantum Gaussian states in question. We give an application to quantum illumination, which is the task of determining whether there is a low-reflectivity object embedded in a target region with a bright thermal-noise bath. For the asymmetric-error setting, we find that a quantum illumination transmitter can achieve an error probability exponent much stronger than a coherent-state transmitter of the same mean photon number, and furthermore, that it requires far fewer trials to do so. This occurs when the background thermal noise is either low or bright, which means that a quantum advantage is even easier to witness than in the symmetric-error setting because it occurs for a larger range of parameters. Going forward from here, we expect our formula to have applications in settings well beyond those considered in this paper, especially to quantum communication tasks involving quantum Gaussian channels."

The purpose is to introduce additive quantum error correcting codes, with emphasis on the use of binary representation of Pauli matrices and modules over a translation group algebra. The topics include symplectic vector spaces, Clifford group, cleaning lemma, an error correcting criterion, entanglement spectrum, implications of the locality of stabilizer group generators, and the classification of translation-invariant one-dimensional additive codes and two-dimensional CSS codes with large code distances. In particular, we describe an algorithm to find a Clifford quantum circuit (CNOTs) to transform any two-dimensional translation-invariant CSS code on qudits of a prime dimension with code distance being the linear system size, into a tensor product of finitely many copies of the qudit toric code and a product state. Thus, the number of embedded toric codes is the complete invariant of these CSS codes under local Clifford circuits."

The results apply to local Hamiltonians with translational invariance in a disorder (i.e., probabilistic) sense with some assumptions on the local distributions. Local terms may be drawn from standard random matrix ensembles. The Hamiltonian can be on a lattice in any spatial dimension or on a graph with a bounded maximum vertex degree. As a corollary there exist finite size partitions with respect to which the ground state is arbitrarily close to a product state. In addition to the lack of an energy gap, we prove that the ground state is degenerate when the local eigenvalue distribution is discrete. This work excludes the important class of truly translationally invariant Hamiltonians where the local terms are all equal."

Goldstone, and S. Gutmann, arXiv:1411.4028] with slightly different parametrization and different objective: rather than looking for a state which approximately solves an optimization problem, our goal is to find a quantum algorithm that, given an instance of MAX-2-SAT, will produce a state with high overlap with the optimal state. Using a machine learning approach, we chose a ""training set"" of instances and optimized the parameters to produce large overlap for the training set. We then tested these optimized parameters on a larger instance set. As a training set, we used a subset of the hard instances studied by E. Crosson, E. Farhi, C. Yen-Yu Lin, H.-H. Lin, and P. Shor (CFLLS) [arXiv:1401.7320]. When tested on the full set, the parameters that we find produce significantly larger overlap than the optimized annealing times of CFLLS. Testing on other random instances from $20$ to $28$ bits continues to show improvement over annealing, with the improvement being most notable on the hardest instances. Further tests on instances of MAX-3-SAT also showed improvement on the hardest instances. This algorithm may be a possible application for near-term quantum computers with limited coherence times."
294,1601.05434,2016,10,27,28,Uniform Additivity in Classical and Quantum Information,Andrew W Cross;Ke Li;Graeme Smith,"Information theory establishes the fundamental limits on data transmission, storage, and processing. Quantum information theory unites information theoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to give a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful possibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and quantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion of different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of entropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding answers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious cases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity region of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a quantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates. Here we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform additivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known quantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly additive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy inequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and intriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive functions are identical; the tractable answers in classical and quantum information theory are formally equivalent. Our techniques pave the way for a deeper understanding of the tractability of information theory, from classical multi-user problems like broadcast channels to the evaluation of quantum channel capacities."

Namely, we show that there exist mixed states which can be represented as a translationally invariant (TI) matrix product density operator (MPDO) valid for all system sizes, but for which there does not exist a TI purification valid for all system sizes. The proof is based on an undecidable problem and on the uniqueness of canonical forms of matrix product states. The result also holds for classical states."

Namely, a partial Boolean function $f$ is computable by a 1-query quantum algorithm with error bounded by $\epsilon<1/2$ iff $f$ can be approximated by a degree-2 polynomial with error bounded by $\epsilon'<1/2$. This result holds for two different notions of approximation by a polynomial: the standard definition of Nisan and Szegedy and the approximation by block-multilinear polynomials recently introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (STOC'2015, arxiv:1411.5729). We also show two results for polynomials of higher degree. First, there is a total Boolean function which requires $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ quantum queries but can be represented by a block-multilinear polynomial of degree $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. Thus, in the general case (for an arbitrary number of queries), block-multilinear polynomials are not equivalent to quantum algorithms. Second, for any constant degree $k$, the two notions of approximation by a polynomial (the standard and the block-multilinear) are equivalent. As a consequence, we solve an open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis, showing that one can estimate the value of any bounded degree-$k$ polynomial $p:\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow [-1, 1]$ with $O(n^{1-\frac{1}{2k}})$ queries."
297,1506.01328,2015,7,6,28,Delegating Private Quantum Computations,Anne Broadbent,"We give a protocol for the delegation of quantum computation on encrypted data. More specifically, we show that in a client-server scenario, where the client holds the encryption key for an encrypted quantum register held by the server, it is possible for the server to perform a universal set of quantum gates on the quantum data. All Clifford group gates are non-interactive, while the remaining non-Clifford group gate that we implement (the p/8 gate) requires the client to prepare and send a single random auxiliary qubit (chosen among four possibilities), and exchange classical communication. This construction improves on previous work, which requires either multiple auxiliary qubits or two-way quantum communication. Using a reduction to an entanglement-based protocol, we show privacy against any adversarial server according to a simulation-based security definition."
298,1505.07432,2015,1,22,28,Classical Verification of Quantum Proofs,Zhengfeng Ji,We present a classical interactive protocol that verifies the validity of a quantum witness state for the local Hamiltonian problem. It follows from this protocol that approximating the non-local value of a multi-player one-round game to inverse polynomial precision is QMA-hard. Our work makes an interesting connection between the theory of QMA-completeness and Hamiltonian complexity on one hand and the study of non-local games and Bell inequalities on the other.
299,1502.04792,2015,12,18,28,Quantum Search with Multiple Walk Steps per Oracle Query,Thomas G Wong;Andris Ambainis,"We identify a key difference between quantum search by discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks: a discrete-time walk typically performs one walk step per oracle query, whereas a continuous-time walk can effectively perform multiple walk steps per query while only counting query time. As a result, we show that continuous-time quantum walks can outperform their discrete-time counterparts, even though both achieve quadratic speedups over their corresponding classical random walks. To provide greater equity, we allow the discrete-time quantum walk to also take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting queries. Then it matches the continuous-time algorithm's runtime, but such that it is a cubic speedup over its corresponding classical random walk. This yields the first example of a greater-than-quadratic speedup for quantum search over its corresponding classical random walk."

Inspired by group theoretic tools, we use the centralizer of a subgroup of operations to present a private-key quantum homomorphic encryption scheme that enables a broad class of quantum computation on encrypted data. A particular instance of our encoding hides up to a constant fraction of the information encrypted. This fraction can be made arbitrarily close to unity with overhead scaling only polynomially in the message length. This highlights the potential of our protocol to hide a non-trivial amount of information, and is suggestive of a large class of encodings that might yield better security."

This question is relevant in physics for the study of correlations and plays an important role in computer science in the context of complexity and cryptography. In this work the case of multiplayer non-signalling games is considered, i.e., the only restriction on the players is that they are not allowed to communicate during the game. For complete-support games (games where all possible combinations of questions have non-zero probability to be asked) with any number of players we prove a threshold theorem stating that the probability that non-signalling players win more than a fraction $1-\alpha+\beta$ of the $n$ games is exponentially small in $n\beta^2$, for every $0\leq \beta \leq \alpha$. For games with incomplete support we derive a similar statement, for a slightly modified form of repetition. The result is proved using a new technique, based on a recent de Finetti theorem, which allows us to avoid central technical difficulties that arise in standard proofs of parallel repetition theorems."
302,1411.0397,2014,5,28,28,Channel Steering,Marco Piani,"We introduce and study the notion of steerability for channels. This generalizes the notion of steerability of bipartite quantum states. We discuss a key conceptual difference between the case of states and the case of channels: while state steering deals with the notion of ""hidden"" states, steerability in the channel case is better understood in terms of coherence of channel extensions, rather than in terms of ""hidden"" channels. This distinction vanishes in the case of states. We further argue how the proposed notion of lack of coherence of channel extensions coincides with the notion of channel extensions realized via local operations and classical communication. We also discuss how the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism allows the direct application of many results about states to the case of channels. We introduce measures for the steerability of channel extensions."

In this paper, we further investigate the class QMA and its related class QCMA by asking what makes quantum witnesses potentially more powerful than classical ones. We provide a definition of a new class, SQMA, where we restrict the possible quantum witnesses to the ""simpler"" subset states, i.e. a uniform superposition over the elements of a subset of n-bit strings. Surprisingly, we prove that this class is equal to QMA, hence providing a new characterisation of the class QMA. We also prove the analogous result for QMA(2) and describe a new complete problem for QMA and a stronger lower bound for the class QMA$_1$."
304,1409.5531,2014,11,20,28,A mathematical theory of resources,Bob Coecke;Tobias Fritz;Robert W Spekkens,"In many different fields of science, it is useful to characterize physical states and processes as resources. Chemistry, thermodynamics, Shannon's theory of communication channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement are prominent examples. Questions addressed by a theory of resources include: Which resources can be converted into which other ones? What is the rate at which arbitrarily many copies of one resource can be converted into arbitrarily many copies of another? Can a catalyst help in making an impossible transformation possible? How does one quantify the resource? Here, we propose a general mathematical definition of what constitutes a resource theory. We prove some general theorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of processes wherein there is a special class of processes that are implementable at no cost and which define the means by which the costly states and processes can be interconverted one to another. We outline how various existing resource theories fit into our framework. Our abstract characterization of resource theories is a first step in a larger project of identifying universal features and principles of resource theories. In this vein, we identify a few general results concerning resource convertibility."
305,1408.3459,2014,11,7,28,On the NP-completeness of the Hartree-Fock method for translationally invariant systems,James Daniel Whitfield;Zoltán Zimborás,"The self-consistent field method utilized for solving the Hartree-Fock (HF) problem and the closely related Kohn-Sham problem, is typically thought of as one of the cheapest methods available to quantum chemists. This intuition has been developed from the numerous applications of the self-consistent field method to a large variety of molecular systems. However, as characterized by its worst-case behavior, the HF problem is NP-complete. In this work, we map out boundaries of the NP-completeness by investigating restricted instances of HF. We have constructed two new NP-complete variants of the problem. The first is a set of Hamiltonians whose translationally invariant Hartree-Fock solutions are trivial, but whose broken symmetry solutions are NP-complete. Second, we demonstrate how to embed instances of spin glasses into translationally invariant Hartree-Fock instances and provide a numerical example. These findings are the first steps towards understanding in which cases the self-consistent field method is computationally feasible and when it is not."
306,1408.1720,2014,11,4,28,Fault-tolerant logical gates in quantum error-correcting codes,Fernando Pastawski;Beni Yoshida,"Recently, Bravyi and König have shown that there is a tradeoff between fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates and geometric locality of stabilizer codes. They consider locality-preserving operations which are implemented by a constant depth geometrically local circuit and are thus fault-tolerant by construction. In particular, they shown that, for local stabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are restricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions and applications of their characterization in various directions. First, we present a new no-go theorem for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we prove that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with a locality-preserving implementation of a non-Clifford gate cannot have a macroscopic energy barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of a D-dimensional local stabilizer code with non-trivial locality-preserving m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by $O(L^{D+1-m})$. For codes with non-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and Terhal. Third we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with non-trivial transversal m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by 1/m. As such, no family of fault-tolerant codes with transversal gates in increasing level of the Clifford hierarchy may exist. This result applies to arbitrary stabilizer and subsystem codes, and is not restricted to geometrically-local codes. Fourth we extend the result of Bravyi and König to subsystem codes. A technical difficulty is that, unlike stabilizer codes, the so-called union lemma does not apply to subsystem codes. This problem is avoided by assuming the presence of error threshold in a subsystem code, and the same conclusion as Bravyi-König is recovered."

While this thesis is crucial for our understanding of computing devices, its implications in other scientific fields have hardly been explored. Here we start this research programme in the context of quantum physics and show that computer science laws have profound implications for some of the most fundamental results of the theory. We first show how they question our knowledge on what a mixed quantum state is, as we identify situations in which ensembles of quantum states defining the same mixed state, indistinguishable according to the quantum postulates, do become distinguishable when prepared by a computer. We also show a new loophole for Bell-like experiments: if some of the parties in a Bell-like experiment use a computer to decide which measurements to make, then the computational resources of an eavesdropper have to be limited in order to have a proper observation of non-locality. Our work opens a new direction in the search for a framework unifying computer science and quantum physics."
308,1404.4466,2014,9,22,28,Matrix product operators and states: NP-hardness and undecidability,Martin Kliesch;David Gross;Jens Eisert,"Tensor network states constitute an important variational set of quantum states for numerical studies of strongly correlated systems in condensed-matter physics, as well as in mathematical physics. This is specifically true for finitely correlated states or matrix-product operators, designed to capture mixed states of one-dimensional quantum systems. It is a well-known open problem to find an efficient algorithm that decides whether a given matrix-product operator actually represents a physical state that in particular has no negative eigenvalues. We address and answer this question by showing that the problem is provably undecidable in the thermodynamic limit and that the bounded version of the problem is NP-hard in the system size. Furthermore, we discuss numerous connections between tensor network methods and (seemingly) different concepts treated before in the literature, such as hidden Markov models and tensor trains."
309,1402.2295,2014,8,18,28,Monte Carlo simulation of stoquastic Hamiltonians,Sergey Bravyi,"Stoquastic Hamiltonians are characterized by the property that their off-diagonal matrix elements in the standard product basis are real and non-positive. Many interesting quantum models fall into this class including the Transverse field Ising Model (TIM), the Heisenberg model on bipartite graphs, and the bosonic Hubbard model. Here we consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy of a local stoquastic Hamiltonian $H$ with a promise that the ground state of $H$ has a non-negligible correlation with some `guiding' state that admits a concise classical description. A formalized version of this problem called Guided Stoquastic Hamiltonian is shown to be complete for the complexity class MA (a probabilistic analogue of NP). To prove this result we employ the Projection Monte Carlo algorithm with a variable number of walkers. Secondly, we show that the ground state and thermal equilibrium properties of the ferromagnetic TIM can be simulated in polynomial time on a classical probabilistic computer. This result is based on the approximation algorithm for the classical ferromagnetic Ising model due to Jerrrum and Sinclair (1993)."

We exhibit correspondences between well-known families of QEC codes and TNs, and demonstrate a formal equivalence between decoding a QEC code and contracting a TN. We build on this equivalence to propose a new family of quantum codes and decoding algorithms that generalize and improve upon quantum polar codes and successive cancellation decoding in a natural way."

Here we develop a resource theory, analogous to the theory of entanglement, for resources for stabilizer codes. We introduce two quantitative measures - monotones - for the amount of non-stabilizer resource. As an application we give absolute bounds on the efficiency of magic state distillation. One of these monotones is the sum of the negative entries of the discrete Wigner representation of a quantum state, thereby resolving a long-standing open question of whether the degree of negativity in a quasi-probability representation is an operationally meaningful indicator of quantum behaviour."
312,1305.6190,2013,4,18,28,Classical simulation complexity of extended Clifford circuits,Richard Jozsa;Maarten Van den Nest,"Clifford gates are a winsome class of quantum operations combining mathematical elegance with physical significance. The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that Clifford computations can be classically efficiently simulated but this is true only in a suitably restricted setting. Here we consider Clifford computations with a variety of additional ingredients: (a) strong vs. weak simulation, (b) inputs being computational basis states vs. general product states, (c) adaptive vs. non-adaptive choices of gates for circuits involving intermediate measurements, (d) single line outputs vs. multi-line outputs. We consider the classical simulation complexity of all combinations of these ingredients and show that many are not classically efficiently simulatable (subject to common complexity assumptions such as P not equal to NP). Our results reveal a surprising proximity of classical to quantum computing power viz. a class of classically simulatable quantum circuits which yields universal quantum computation if extended by a purely classical additional ingredient that does not extend the class of quantum processes occurring."

Here we analyze their model and in addition present a similar model derived from the semi-classical limit of quantum spin dynamics, which also exhibits a bimodal distribution. We find that in both cases the correlations between the success probabilities of these classical models and the D-Wave device are weak compared to the correlations between a simulated quantum annealer and the D-Wave device. Indeed, the evidence for quantum annealing presented in arXiv:1304.4595 is not limited to the bimodality, but relies in addition on the success probability correlations between the D-Wave device and the simulated quantum annealer. The Smolin-Smith model and our semi-classical spin model both fail this correlation test."

Knill and R. Laflamme, Phys. Rev. Lett. \bf81, 5672 (1998)] is a model of quantum computing where the input is the tensor product of a single pure qubit and many completely-mixed states, and only the single qubit is measured at the end of the computation. In spite of its naive appearance, the DQC1 model can efficiently solve some problems for which no classical efficient algorithms are known, and therefore it has been conjectured that the DQC1 model is more powerful than classical computing (under the assumption of $\mbox{BPP}\subsetneq\mbox{BQP}$). Here we show that the output probability distribution of the DQC1 model cannot be classically efficiently approximated (exactly within a polynomial bit length or in the fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) with at most a constant error) unless $\mbox{BQP}\subseteq\mbox{BPP}$."
315,1609.09047,2016,5,28,27,Quantum Tokens for Digital Signatures,Shalev Ben David;Or Sattath,"The fisherman caught a quantum fish. ""Fisherman, please let me go"", begged the fish, ""and I will grant you three wishes"". The fisherman agreed. The fish gave the fisherman a quantum computer, three quantum signing tokens and his classical public key. The fish explained: ""to sign your three wishes, use the tokenized signature scheme on this quantum computer, then show your valid signature to the king, who owes me a favor"". The fisherman used one of the signing tokens to sign the document ""give me a castle!"" and rushed to the palace. The king executed the classical verification algorithm using the fish's public key, and since it was valid, the king complied. The fisherman's wife wanted to sign ten wishes using their two remaining signing tokens. The fisherman did not want to cheat, and secretly sailed to meet the fish. ""Fish, my wife wants to sign ten more wishes"". But the fish was not worried: ""I have learned quantum cryptography following the previous story (The Fisherman and His Wife by the brothers Grimm). The quantum tokens are consumed during the signing. Your polynomial wife cannot even sign four wishes using the three signing tokens I gave you"". ""How does it work?"" wondered the fisherman. ""Have you heard of quantum money? These are quantum states which can be easily verified but are hard to copy. This tokenized quantum signature scheme extends Aaronson and Christiano's quantum money scheme, which is why the signing tokens cannot be copied"". ""Does your scheme have additional fancy properties?"" the fisherman asked. ""Yes, the scheme has other security guarantees: revocability, testability and everlasting security. Furthermore, if you're at sea and your quantum phone has only classical reception, you can use this scheme to transfer the value of the quantum money to shore"", said the fish, and swam away."
316,1605.03564,2016,5,27,27,Combinatorial Entanglement,Joshua Lockhart;Simone Severini,"We present new combinatorial objects, which we call grid-labelled graphs, and show how these can be used to represent the quantum states arising in a scenario which we refer to as the faulty emitter scenario: we have a machine designed to emit a particular quantum state on demand, but which can make an error and emit a different one. The device is able to produce a list of candidate states which can be used as a kind of debugging information for testing entanglement. By reformulating the Peres-Horodecki and matrix realignment criteria we are able to capture some characteristic features of entanglement: we construct new bound entangled states, and demonstrate the limitations of matrix realignment. We show how the notion of LOCC is related to a generalisation of the graph isomorphism problem. We give a simple proof that asymptotically almost surely, grid-labelled graphs associated to very sparse density matrices are entangled. We develop tools for enumerating grid-labelled graphs that satisfy the Peres-Horodecki criterion up to a fixed number of vertices, and propose various computational problems for these objects, whose complexity remains an open problem. The proposed mathematical framework also suggests new combinatorial and algebraic ways for describing the structure of graphs."
317,1409.3998,2014,5,28,27,Beyond heat baths: Generalized resource theories for small-scale thermodynamics,Nicole Yunger Halpern;Joseph M Renes,"Thermodynamics has recently been extended to small scales with resource theories that model heat exchanges. Real physical systems exchange diverse quantities: heat, particles, angular momentum, etc. We generalize thermodynamic resource theories to exchanges of observables other than heat, to baths other than heat baths, and to free energies other than the Helmholtz free energy. These generalizations are illustrated with ""grand-potential"" theories that model movements of heat and particles. Free operations include unitaries that conserve energy and particle number. From this conservation law and from resource-theory principles, the grand-canonical form of the free states is derived. States are shown to form a quasiorder characterized by free operations, d-majorization, the hypothesis-testing entropy, and rescaled Lorenz curves. We calculate the work distillable from, and we bound the work cost of creating, a state. These work quantities can differ but converge to the grand potential in the thermodynamic limit. Extending thermodynamic resource theories beyond heat baths, we open diverse realistic systems to modeling with one-shot statistical mechanics. Prospective applications such as electrochemical batteries are hoped to bridge one-shot theory to experiments."

This measure is essentially equivalent to the approximate gamma_2 norm and generalized discrepancy, and subsumes several other lower bounds. All known lower bounds on quantum communication complexity in the general unbounded-round model can be shown via the logarithm of approximate rank, and it was an open problem to give any separation at all between quantum communication complexity and the logarithm of the approximate rank. In this work we provide the first such separation: We exhibit a total function H with quantum communication complexity almost quadratically larger than the logarithm of its approximate rank. We construct H using the communication lookup function framework of Anshu et al. (FOCS 2016) based on the cheat sheet framework of Aaronson et al. (STOC 2016). From a starting function F, this framework defines a new function H=F_G. Our main technical result is a lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of F_G in terms of the discrepancy of F, which we do via quantum information theoretic arguments. We show the upper bound on the approximate rank of F_G by relating it to the Boolean circuit size of the starting function F."

In the quantum setting, we find that the computational power of this model depends on the initial input states. More precisely, with a standard basis input state, we show how to approximate the amplitudes of this model within additive error using the model DQC1 (the class of problems solvable with one clean qubit), providing evidence that the model in this case is weaker than universal quantum computing. However, for specific choices of input states, the model is shown to be universal for BQP in an encoded sense. We use representation theory of the symmetric group to partially classify the computational complexity of this model for arbitrary input states. Interestingly, we find some input states which yield a model intermediate between DQC1 and BQP. Furthermore, we consider a restricted version of this model based on an integrable scattering problem in 1+1 dimensions. We show it is universal under postselection, if we allow intermediate destructive measurements and specific input states. Therefore, the existence of any classical procedure to sample from the output distribution of this model within multiplicative error implies collapse of polynomial hierarchy to its third level. Finally, we define a classical version of this model in which one can probabilistically permute balls. We find this yields a complexity class which is intermediate between L and BPP. Moreover, we find a nondeterministic version of this model is NP-complete."

The ground space connectivity problem asks whether it is possible to go from one (efficiently preparable) state to another by applying a polynomial length sequence of 2-qubit unitaries while remaining at all times in a state with low energy for a given Hamiltonian $H$. It was shown in [Gharibian and Sikora, ICALP'15] that this problem is QCMA-complete for general local Hamiltonians, where QCMA is defined as QMA with a classical witness and BQP verifier. Here we show that the commuting version of the problem is also QCMA-complete. This provides one of the first examples where commuting local Hamiltonians exhibit complexity theoretic hardness equivalent to general local Hamiltonians."
321,1608.04750,2016,12,12,27,Conditional Mutual Information of Bipartite Unitaries and Scrambling,Dawei Ding;Patrick Hayden;Michael Walter,"One way to diagnose chaos in bipartite unitary channels is via the tripartite information of the corresponding Choi state, which for certain choices of the subsystems reduces to the negative conditional mutual information (CMI). We study this quantity from a quantum information-theoretic perspective to clarify its role in diagnosing scrambling. When the CMI is zero, we find that the channel has a special normal form consisting of local channels between individual inputs and outputs. However, we find that arbitrarily low CMI does not imply arbitrary proximity to a channel of this form, although it does imply a type of approximate recoverability of one of the inputs. When the CMI is maximal, we find that the residual channel from an individual input to an individual output is completely depolarizing when the other input is maximally mixed. However, we again find that this result is not robust. We also extend some of these results to the multipartite case and to the case of Haar-random pure input states. Finally, we look at the relationship between tripartite information and its Renyi-2 version which is directly related to out-of-time-order correlation functions. In particular, we demonstrate an arbitrarily large gap between the two quantities."

In contrast, passive error correction relies on the natural physical dynamics of a system to protect encoded quantum information. However, the search is ongoing for a completely satisfactory passive scheme applicable to locally-interacting two-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate dynamical decoders that provide passive error correction by embedding the decoding process into local dynamics. We propose a specific dynamical decoder based on a discrete time cellular-automaton decoder and provide numerical evidence of a fault-tolerant threshold. We stress that (asynchronous) dynamical decoding gives rise to a Markovian dissipative process. We hence equate cellular-automaton decoding to a fully dissipative topological quantum memory, which removes errors continuously. In this sense, uncontrolled and unwanted local noise can be corrected for by a controlled local dissipative process. We analyze the required resources, and speculate about an ideal constant resource dynamical decoder. Finally, we present our own numerical analysis of another dynamical decoder proposed by Harrington."

While the most well-known example of this discipline is quantum key distribution (QKD), there exist many other applications such as quantum money, randomness generation, secure two- and multi-party computation and delegated quantum computation. Quantum cryptography also studies the limitations and challenges resulting from quantum adversaries---including the impossibility of quantum bit commitment, the difficulty of quantum rewinding and the definition of quantum security models for classical primitives. In this review article, aimed primarily at cryptographers unfamiliar with the quantum world, we survey the area of theoretical quantum cryptography, with an emphasis on the constructions and limitations beyond the realm of QKD."
324,1510.00578,2015,10,13,27,Dvoretzky's theorem and the complexity of entanglement detection,Guillaume Aubrun;Stanislaw J Szarek,"The well-known Horodecki criterion asserts that a state $\rho$ on $\mathbf{C}^d \otimes \mathbf{C}^d$ is entangled if and only if there exists a positive map $\Phi : \mathsf{M}_d \to \mathsf{M}_d$ such that the operator $(\Phi \otimes \mathrm{Id})(\rho)$ is not positive semi-definite. We show that that the number of such maps needed to detect all the robustly entangled states (i.e., states $\rho$ which remain entangled even in the presence of substantial randomizing noise) exceeds $\exp(c d^3 / \log d)$. The proof is based on the 1977 inequality of Figiel--Lindenstrauss--Milman, which ultimately relies on Dvoretzky's theorem about almost spherical sections of convex bodies. We interpret that inequality as a statement about approximability of convex bodies by polytopes with few vertices or with few faces and apply it to the study of fine properties of the set of quantum states and that of separable states. Our results can be thought of as geometrical manifestations of the complexity of entanglement detection."

It is especially suited for injective PEPS and thermal states of local commuting Hamiltonians on a lattice. We show that for a uniform gap and sufficiently smooth paths, an adiabatic runtime and circuit depth of $O(\operatorname{polylog}N)$ can be achieved for $O(N)$ spins. This is an almost exponential improvement over previous bounds. The total number of elementary gates scales as $O(N\operatorname{polylog}N)$. This is also faster than the best known upper bound of $O(N^2)$ on the mixing times of Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithms for sampling classical systems in thermal equilibrium."

For example, we might ask how much work can be obtained by thermalizing $\rho$ to a thermal state $\sigma$ at temperature $T$ of an ambient heat bath. Here, we show that for large systems, or when allowing slightly inexact catalysis, the amount of work is characterized by how reversible the process is. More specifically, the amount of work to be gained depends on how well we can return the state $\sigma$ to its original form $\rho$ without investing any work. We proceed to exhibit an explicit reversal operation in terms of the Petz recovery channel coming from quantum information theory. Our result establishes a quantitative link between the reversibility of thermodynamical processes and the corresponding work gain."
327,1501.05636,2015,11,19,27,"Quantum Markov chains, sufficiency of quantum channels, and Renyi information measures",Nilanjana Datta;Mark M Wilde,"A short quantum Markov chain is a tripartite state $\rho_{ABC}$ such that system $A$ can be recovered perfectly by acting on system $C$ of the reduced state $\rho_{BC}$. Such states have conditional mutual information $I(A;B|C)$ equal to zero and are the only states with this property. A quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$ is sufficient for two states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ if there exists a recovery channel using which one can perfectly recover $\rho$ from $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ and $\sigma$ from $\mathcal{N}(\sigma)$. The relative entropy difference $D(\rho\Vert\sigma)-D(\mathcal{N}(\rho)\Vert\mathcal{N}(\sigma))$ is equal to zero if and only if $\mathcal{N}$ is sufficient for $\rho$ and $\sigma$. In this paper, we show that these properties extend to Renyi generalizations of these information measures which were proposed in [Berta et al., J. Math. Phys. 56, 022205, (2015)] and [Seshadreesan et al., J. Phys. A 48, 395303, (2015)], thus providing an alternate characterization of short quantum Markov chains and sufficient quantum channels. These results give further support to these quantities as being legitimate Renyi generalizations of the conditional mutual information and the relative entropy difference. Along the way, we solve some open questions of Ruskai and Zhang, regarding the trace of particular matrices that arise in the study of monotonicity of relative entropy under quantum operations and strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy."
328,1412.3828,2014,10,22,27,A derivation (and quantification) of the third law of thermodynamics,Lluis Masanes;Jonathan Oppenheim,"The third law of thermodynamics has a controversial past and a number of formulations due to Planck, Einstein, and Nernst. It's most accepted version, the unattainability principle, states that ""any thermodynamic process cannot reach the temperature of absolute zero by a finite number of steps and within a finite time."" Although formulated in 1912, there has been no general proof of the principle, and the only evidence we have for it is that particular cooling methods become less efficient as the temperature decreases. Here we provide the first derivation of a general unattainability principle, which applies to arbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. We quantify the resources needed to cool a system to any particular temperature, and translate these resources into a minimal time or number of steps by considering the notion of a Thermal Machine which obeys similar restrictions to universal computers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an inverse power of the cooling time. Our argument relies on the heat capacity of the bath being positive, and we show that if this is not the case then perfect cooling in finite time is in principle possible. Our results also clarify the connection between two versions of the third law (the Unattainability Principle and the Heat Theorem), and place ultimate bounds on the speed at which information can be erased."

This requires the algorithm on input x to output a nonnegative random variable whose expectation equals f(x), using as few queries to the input x as possible. We exactly characterize both the randomized and the quantum query complexity by two polynomial degrees, the nonnegative literal degree and the sum-of-squares degree, respectively. We observe that the quantum complexity can be unboundedly smaller than the classical complexity for some functions, but can be at most polynomially smaller for functions with range 0,1. These query complexities relate to (and are motivated by) the extension complexity of polytopes. The linear extension complexity of a polytope is characterized by the randomized communication complexity of computing its slack matrix in expectation, and the semidefinite (psd) extension complexity is characterized by the analogous quantum model. Since query complexity can be used to upper bound communication complexity of related functions, we can derive some upper bounds on psd extension complexity by constructing efficient quantum query algorithms. As an example we give an exponentially-close entrywise approximation of the slack matrix of the perfect matching polytope with psd-rank only 2^n^1/2+epsilon. Finally, we show there is a precise sense in which randomized/quantum query complexity in expectation corresponds to the Sherali-Adams and Lasserre hierarchies, respectively."
330,1408.5881,2014,8,5,27,Perturbative gadgets without strong interactions,Yudong Cao;Daniel Nagaj,"Perturbative gadgets are used to construct a quantum Hamiltonian whose low-energy subspace approximates a given quantum $k$-body Hamiltonian up to an absolute error $\epsilon$. Typically, gadget constructions involve terms with large interaction strengths of order $\text{poly}(\epsilon^{-1})$. Here we present a 2-body gadget construction and prove that it approximates a target many-body Hamiltonian of interaction strength $\gamma = O(1)$ up to absolute error $\epsilon\ll\gamma$ using interactions of strength $O(\epsilon)$ instead of the usual inverse polynomial in $\epsilon$. A key component in our proof is a new condition for the convergence of the perturbation series, allowing our gadget construction to be applied in parallel on multiple many-body terms. We also show how to apply this gadget construction for approximating 3- and $k$-body Hamiltonians. The price we pay for using much weaker interactions is a large overhead in the number of ancillary qubits, and the number of interaction terms per particle, both of which scale as $O(\text{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}))$. Our strong-from-weak gadgets have their primary application in complexity theory (QMA hardness of restricted Hamiltonians, a generalized area law counterexample, gap amplification), but could also motivate practical implementations with many weak interactions simulating a much stronger quantum many-body interaction."

Topological methods for analyzing data sets provide a powerful technique for extracting such information. Persistent homology is a sophisticated tool for identifying such topological features -- connected components, holes, or voids -- and for determining how such features persist as the data is viewed at different scales. This paper provides quantum algorithms for calculating Betti numbers in persistent homology, and for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian. The algorithms provide an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for topological data analysis."
332,1407.0085,2014,1,23,27,Improved Quantum Algorithm for Triangle Finding via Combinatorial Arguments,François Le Gall,"In this paper we present a quantum algorithm solving the triangle finding problem in unweighted graphs with query complexity $\tilde O(n^{5/4})$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph. This improves the previous upper bound $O(n^{9/7})=O(n^{1.285...})$ recently obtained by Lee, Magniez and Santha. Our result shows, for the first time, that in the quantum query complexity setting unweighted triangle finding is easier than its edge-weighted version, since for finding an edge-weighted triangle Belovs and Rosmanis proved that any quantum algorithm requires $\Omega(n^{9/7}/\sqrt{\log n})$ queries. Our result also illustrates some limitations of the non-adaptive learning graph approach used to obtain the previous $O(n^{9/7})$ upper bound since, even over unweighted graphs, any quantum algorithm for triangle finding obtained using this approach requires $\Omega(n^{9/7}/\sqrt{\log n})$ queries as well. To bypass the obstacles characterized by these lower bounds, our quantum algorithm uses combinatorial ideas exploiting the graph-theoretic properties of triangle finding, which cannot be used when considering edge-weighted graphs or the non-adaptive learning graph approach."
333,1312.3717,2013,12,15,27,Optimal algorithms for linear algebra by quantum inspiration,Michael Ben-Or;Lior Eldar,"Recent results by Harrow et. al. and by Ta-Shma, suggest that quantum computers may have an exponential advantage in solving a wealth of linear algebraic problems, over classical algorithms. Building on the quantum intuition of these results, we step back into the classical domain, and explore its usefulness in designing classical algorithms. We achieve an algorithm for solving the major linear-algebraic problems in time $O(n^{\omega+\nu})$ for any $\nu>0$, where $\omega$ is the optimal matrix-product constant. Thus our algorithm is optimal w.r.t. matrix multiplication, and comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithm for these problems due to Demmel et. al. Being derived from quantum intuition, our proposed algorithm is completely disjoint from all previous classical algorithms, and builds on a combination of low-discrepancy sequences and perturbation analysis. As such, we hope it motivates further exploration of quantum techniques in this respect, hopefully leading to improvements in our understanding of space complexity and numerical stability of these problems."

In arXiv:1306.3995, Gogolin et al. claimed that even an ideal BosonSampling device's output would be ""operationally indistinguishable"" from a uniform random outcome, at least ""without detailed a priori knowledge""; or at any rate, that telling the two apart might itself be a hard problem. We first answer these claims---explaining why the first is based on a definition of ""a priori knowledge"" so strange that, were it adopted, almost no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure random-number source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle to interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further, and address some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.'s mistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random matrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced by A is far from the uniform distribution in total variation distance. More surprisingly, and directly counter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes these two distributions with constant bias. Finally, we offer three ""bonus"" results about BosonSampling. First, we report an observation of Fernando Brandao: that one can efficiently sample a distribution that has large entropy and that's indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by any circuit of fixed polynomial size. Second, we show that BosonSampling distributions can be efficiently distinguished from uniform even with photon losses and for general initial states. Third, we offer the simplest known proof that FermionSampling is solvable in classical polynomial time, and we reuse techniques from our BosonSampling analysis to characterize random FermionSampling distributions."
335,1305.6973,2013,8,26,27,Lattice quantum codes and exotic topological phases of matter,Jeongwan Haah,"This thesis addresses whether it is possible to build a robust memory device for quantum information. A three-dimensional gapped lattice spin model is found which demonstrates for the first time that a reliable quantum memory at finite temperature is possible, at least to some extent. When quantum information is encoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to thermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without any active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors well localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved faithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the inverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological quantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales exponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square. This spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order, in which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are immobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. The degeneracy of the ground state, though also insensitive to perturbations, is a complicated number-theoretic function of the system size, and the system bifurcates into multiple noninteracting copies of itself under real-space renormalization group transformations. The degeneracy, the excitations, and the renormalization group flow can be analyzed using a framework that exploits the spin model's symmetry and some associated free resolutions of modules over polynomial algebras."

In the quantum k-SAT problem, each constraint is specified by a k-local projector and is satisfied by any state in its nullspace. Bravyi showed that quantum 2-SAT can be solved efficiently on a classical computer and that quantum k-SAT with k greater than or equal to 4 is QMA1-complete. Quantum 3-SAT was known to be contained in QMA1, but its computational hardness was unknown until now. We prove that quantum 3-SAT is QMA1-hard, and therefore complete for this complexity class."
337,1612.09306,2016,7,2,26,Limitations of semidefinite programs for separable states and entangled games,Aram W Harrow;Anand Natarajan;Xiaodi Wu,"Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are a framework for exact or approximate optimization that have widespread application in quantum information theory. We introduce a new method for using reductions to construct integrality gaps for SDPs. These are based on new limitations on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy in approximating two particularly important sets in quantum information theory, where previously no $\omega(1)$-round integrality gaps were known: the set of separable (i.e. unentangled) states, or equivalently, the $2 \rightarrow 4$ norm of a matrix, and the set of quantum correlations; i.e. conditional probability distributions achievable with local measurements on a shared entangled state. In both cases no-go theorems were previously known based on computational assumptions such as the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) which asserts that 3-SAT requires exponential time to solve. Our unconditional results achieve the same parameters as all of these previous results (for separable states) or as some of the previous results (for quantum correlations). In some cases we can make use of the framework of Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer (LRS) to establish integrality gaps for any SDP, not only the SoS hierarchy. Our hardness result on separable states also yields a dimension lower bound of approximate disentanglers, answering a question of Watrous and Aaronson et al. These results can be viewed as limitations on the monogamy principle, the PPT test, the ability of Tsirelson-type bounds to restrict quantum correlations, as well as the SDP hierarchies of Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri, Navascues-Pironio-Acin and Berta-Fawzi-Scholz."
338,1612.04779,2016,12,16,26,Universal Laws of Thermodynamics,Manabendra Nath Bera;Arnau Riera;Maciej Lewenstein;Andreas Winter,"Thermodynamics is one of the most successful physical theories ever formulated. Though it was initially developed to deal with steam engines and, in particular, the problem of conversion of heat into mechanical work, it has prevailed even after the scientific revolutions of relativity and quantum mechanics. Despite its wide range of applicability, it is known that the laws of thermodynamics break down when systems are correlated with their environments. In the presence of correlations, anomalous heat flows from cold to hot baths become possible, as well as memory erasure accompanied by work extraction instead of heat dissipation. Here, we generalize thermodynamics to physical scenarios which allow presence of correlations, including those where strong correlations are present. We exploit the connection between information and physics, and introduce a consistent redefinition of heat dissipation by systematically accounting for the information flow from system to bath in terms of the conditional entropy. As a consequence, the formula for the Helmholtz free energy is accordingly modified. Such a remedy not only fixes the apparent violations of Landauer's erasure principle and the second law due to anomalous heat flows, but it also leads to a reformulation of the laws of thermodynamics that are universally respected. In this information-theoretic approach, correlations between system and environment store work potential. Thus, in this view, the apparent anomalous heat flows are the refrigeration processes driven by such potentials."

Pauli channels can be efficiently simulated and threshold values for Pauli error rates under a variety of error-correcting codes have been obtained. However, realistic quantum systems can undergo noise processes that differ significantly from Pauli noise. In this paper, we present an efficient hard decoding algorithm for optimizing thresholds and lowering failure rates of an error-correcting code under general completely positive and trace-preserving (i.e., Markovian) noise. We use our hard decoding algorithm to study the performance of several error-correcting codes under various non-Pauli noise models by computing threshold values and failure rates for these codes. We compare the performance of our hard decoding algorithm to decoders optimized for depolarizing noise and show improvements in thresholds and reductions in failure rates by several orders of magnitude. Our hard decoding algorithm can also be adapted to take advantage of a code's non-Pauli transversal gates to further suppress noise. For example, we show that using the transversal gates of the 5-qubit code allows arbitrary rotations around certain axes to be perfectly corrected. Furthermore, we show that Pauli twirling can increase or decrease the threshold depending upon the code properties. Lastly, we show that even if the physical noise model differs slightly from the hypothesized noise model used to determine an optimized decoder, failure rates can still be reduced by applying our hard decoding algorithm."

We give a simple test to certify that two systems share an asymptotically large amount of entanglement, n EPR states. The test is efficient: unlike earlier tests that play many games, in sequence or in parallel, our test requires only one or two CHSH games. One system is directed to play a CHSH game on a random specified qubit i, and the other is told to play games on qubits i,j, without knowing which index is i. The test is robust: a success probability within delta of optimal guarantees distance O(n^5/2 sqrtdelta) from n EPR states. However, the test does not tolerate constant delta; it breaks down for delta = Omega~(1/sqrtn). We give an adversarial strategy that succeeds within delta of the optimum probability using only O~(delta^-2) EPR states."
341,1609.08592,2016,2,5,26,The additive classical capacity of quantum channels assisted by noisy entanglement,Quntao Zhuang;Yechao Zhu;Peter W Shor,"We give a capacity formula for the classical information transmission over a noisy quantum channel, with separable encoding by the sender and limited resources provided by the receiver's pre-shared ancilla. Instead of a pure state, we consider the signal-ancilla pair in a mixed state, purified by a ""witness"". Thus, the signal-witness correlation limits the resource available from the signal-ancilla correlation. Our formula characterizes the utility of different forms of resources, including noisy or limited entanglement assistance, for classical communication. With separable encoding, the sender's signals between different channel uses are still allowed to be entangled, yet our capacity formula is additive. In particular, for generalized covariant channels our capacity formula has a simple closed-form. Moreover, our additive capacity formula upper bounds the general coherent attack's information gain in various two-way quantum key distribution protocols. For Gaussian protocols, the additivity of the formula indicates that the collective Gaussian attack is the most powerful."
342,1609.06994,2016,12,28,26,Deconstruction and conditional erasure of quantum correlations,Mario Berta;Fernando G S L Brandão;Christian Majenz;Mark M Wilde,"We define the deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ as the minimum rate of noise needed to apply to the $AE$ systems, such that there is negligible disturbance to the marginal state on the $BE$ systems and the system $A$ of the resulting state is locally recoverable from the $E$ system alone. We refer to such actions as deconstruction operations and protocols implementing them as state deconstruction protocols. State deconstruction generalizes Landauer erasure of a single-party quantum state as well the erasure of correlations of a two-party quantum state. We find that the deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ is equal to its conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) $I(A;B|E)$, thus giving the CQMI an operational interpretation in terms of a state deconstruction protocol. We also define a related task called conditional erasure, in which the goal is to apply noise to systems $AE$ in order to decouple system $A$ from systems $BE$, while causing negligible disturbance to the marginal state of systems $BE$. We find that the optimal rate of noise for conditional erasure is also equal to the CQMI $I(A;B|E)$. State deconstruction and conditional erasure lead to operational interpretations of the quantum discord and squashed entanglement, which are quantum correlation measures based on the CQMI. We find that the quantum discord is equal to the cost of simulating einselection, the process by which a quantum system interacts with an environment, resulting in selective loss of information in the system. The squashed entanglement is equal to half the minimum rate of noise needed for deconstruction/conditional erasure if Alice has available the best possible system $E$ to help in the deconstruction/conditional erasure task."

Two families of such generalizations turn out to be particularly useful: the Petz quantum Renyi divergence $\bar{D}_{\alpha}$ and the minimal quantum Renyi divergence $\tilde{D}_{\alpha}$. In this paper, we prove a reverse Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality that implies a new relation between these two families of divergences, namely that $\alpha \bar{D}_{\alpha}(\rho \| \sigma) \leq \tilde{D}_{\alpha}(\rho \| \sigma)$ for $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and where $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are density operators. This bound suggests defining a ""pretty good fidelity"", whose relation to the usual fidelity implies the known relations between the optimal and pretty good measurement as well as the optimal and pretty good singlet fraction. We also find a new necessary and sufficient condition for optimality of the pretty good measurement and singlet fraction."

We present a scheme to protect the information stored in a system supporting non-cyclic anyons against thermal and measurement errors. The correction procedure builds on the work of Gács and Harrington and operates as a local cellular automaton. In contrast to previously studied schemes, our scheme is valid for both abelian and non-abelian anyons and accounts for measurement errors. We prove the existence of a fault-tolerant threshold and numerically simulate the procedure for a system of Ising anyons. The result of our simulations are consistent with a threshold between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$."

By simulating the dynamics for small systems, we numerically observe a certain stability of the prepared state as a function of the initial Hamiltonian. For small systems or long interpolation times, we argue that the resulting state can be identified by computing suitable effective Hamiltonians. For effective anyon models, this analysis singles out the relevant physical processes and extends the study of the splitting of the topological degeneracy by Bonderson. We illustrate our findings using Kitaev's Majorana chain, effective anyon chains, the toric code and Levin-Wen string-net models."
346,1602.08898,2016,8,31,26,Converse bounds for private communication over quantum channels,Mark M Wilde;Marco Tomamichel;Mario Berta,"This paper establishes several converse bounds on the private transmission capabilities of a quantum channel. The main conceptual development builds firmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum method for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local operations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum privacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach has previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates, including the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement. Here we use this approach along with a ""privacy test"" to establish a general meta-converse bound for private communication, which has a number of applications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's relative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for private communication. For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to second-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private communication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private communication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by unlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for establishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols conducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several channels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds on the private transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic channels."
347,1602.01771,2016,7,11,26,On Quantum Obfuscation,Gorjan Alagic;Bill Fefferman,"Encryption of data is fundamental to secure communication in the modern world. Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of functionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating classical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible [Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate schemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have numerous applications. In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via quantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which encompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe classical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description or a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of obfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box, indistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three variants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many applications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum fully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money. We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of foundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove that quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries can possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic transformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits is impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation is impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs involve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which was recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions exist [Alagic et al '16]."

This answers in the affirmative a natural question that has been open for a long time, as monotonicity had previously only been shown to hold under additional assumptions, such as complete positivity or Schwarz-positivity of the adjoint map. The first step in our proof is to show monotonicity of the sandwiched Renyi divergences under positive trace-preserving maps, extending a proof of the data processing inequality by Beigi [J. Math. Phys. 54, 122202 (2013)] that is based on complex interpolation techniques. Our result calls into question several measures of non-Markovianity that have been proposed, as these would assess all positive trace-preserving time evolutions as Markovian."

An important class of problems where quantum computers possess an advantage is phase estimation, which includes applications like factoring. We introduce a new computational model based on a single squeezed state resource that can perform phase estimation, which we call the power of one qumode. This model is inspired by an interesting computational model known as deterministic quantum computing with one quantum bit (DQC1). Using the power of one qumode, we identify that the amount of squeezing is sufficient to quantify the resource requirements of different computational problems based on phase estimation. In particular, it establishes a quantitative relationship between the resources required for factoring and DQC1. For example, we find the squeezing required to factor has an exponential scaling whereas no squeezing (i.e., a coherent state) is already sufficient to solve the hardest problem in DQC1."

A lower bound shown independently by Kane and Kutin and by Meyer and Pommersheim shows that d/2+1/2 quantum queries are needed to solve this problem with bounded error, whereas an algorithm of Boneh and Zhandry shows that d quantum queries are sufficient. We show that the lower bound is achievable: d/2+1/2 quantum queries suffice to determine the polynomial with bounded error. Furthermore, we show that d/2+1 queries suffice to achieve probability approaching 1 for large q. These upper bounds improve results of Boneh and Zhandry on the insecurity of cryptographic protocols against quantum attacks. We also show that our algorithm's success probability as a function of the number of queries is precisely optimal. Furthermore, the algorithm can be implemented with gate complexity poly(log q) with negligible decrease in the success probability. We end with a conjecture about the quantum query complexity of multivariate polynomial interpolation."
351,1509.07766,2015,2,5,26,When a local Hamiltonian must be frustration-free,Or Sattath;Siddhardh C Morampudi;Christopher R Laumann;Roderich Moessner,"A broad range of quantum optimisation problems can be phrased as the question whether a specific system has a ground state at zero energy, i.e.\ whether its Hamiltonian is frustration free. Frustration-free Hamiltonians, in turn, play a central role for constructing and understanding new phases of matter in quantum many-body physics. Unfortunately, determining whether this is the case is known to be a complexity-theoretically intractable problem. This makes it highly desirable to search for efficient heuristics and algorithms in order to, at least, partially answer this question. Here we prove a general criterion - a sufficient condition - under which a local Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be frustration free by lifting Shearer's theorem from classical probability theory to the quantum world. Remarkably, evaluating this condition proceeds via a fully classical analysis of a hard-core lattice gas at negative fugacity on the Hamiltonian's interaction graph which, as a statistical mechanics problem, is of interest in its own right. We concretely apply this criterion to local Hamiltonians on various regular lattices, while bringing to bear the tools of spin glass physics which permit us to obtain new bounds on the SAT/UNSAT transition in random quantum satisfiability. These also lead us to natural conjectures for when such bounds will be tight, as well as to a novel notion of universality for these computer science problems. Besides providing concrete algorithms leading to detailed and quantitative insights, this underscores the power of marrying classical statistical mechanics with quantum computation and complexity theory."

We do so by studying the exclusion game [C. Perry et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 030504 (2015)] for which there exist instances where the quantum information complexity tends to zero as the size of the input $n$ increases. By showing that the quantum communication complexity of these games scales at least logarithmically in $n$, we obtain our result. We further show that the established lower bounds and gaps still hold even if we allow a small probability of error. However in this case, the $n$-qubit quantum message of the zero-error strategy can be compressed polynomially."
353,1507.00432,2015,10,19,26,Approximate Span Programs,Tsuyoshi Ito;Stacey Jeffery,"Span programs are a model of computation that have been used to design quantum algorithms, mainly in the query model. For any decision problem, there exists a span program that leads to an algorithm with optimal quantum query complexity, but finding such an algorithm is generally challenging. We consider new ways of designing quantum algorithms using span programs. We show how any span program that decides a problem $f$ can also be used to decide ""property testing"" versions of $f$, or more generally, approximate the span program witness size, a property of the input related to $f$. For example, using our techniques, the span program for OR, which can be used to design an optimal algorithm for the OR function, can also be used to design optimal algorithms for: threshold functions, in which we want to decide if the Hamming weight of a string is above a threshold or far below, given the promise that one of these is true; and approximate counting, in which we want to estimate the Hamming weight of the input. We achieve these results by relaxing the requirement that 1-inputs hit some target exactly in the span program, which could make design of span programs easier. We also give an exposition of span program structure, which increases the understanding of this important model. One implication is alternative algorithms for estimating the witness size when the phase gap of a certain unitary can be lower bounded. We show how to lower bound this phase gap in some cases. As applications, we give the first upper bounds in the adjacency query model on the quantum time complexity of estimating the effective resistance between $s$ and $t$, $R_{s,t}(G)$, of $\tilde O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{3/2}}n\sqrt{R_{s,t}(G)})$, and, when $\mu$ is a lower bound on $\lambda_2(G)$, by our phase gap lower bound, we can obtain $\tilde O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}n\sqrt{R_{s,t}(G)/\mu})$, both using $O(\log n)$ space."
354,1506.07080,2015,10,1,26,Maximally entangled states in pseudo-telepathy games,Laura Mančinska,"A pseudo-telepathy game is a nonlocal game which can be won with probability one using some finite-dimensional quantum strategy but not using a classical one. Our central question is whether there exist two-party pseudo-telepathy games which cannot be won with probability one using a maximally entangled state. Towards answering this question, we develop conditions under which maximally entangled states suffice. In particular, we show that maximally entangled states suffice for weak projection games which we introduce as a relaxation of projection games. Our results also imply that any pseudo-telepathy weak projection game yields a device-independent certification of a maximally entangled state. In particular, by establishing connections to the setting of communication complexity, we exhibit a class of games $G_n$ for testing maximally entangled states of local dimension $\Omega(n)$. We leave the robustness of these self-tests as an open question."

Crucially, the corresponding recovery operation should perform well without knowing the information to be reconstructed. In this work, we show that the quantum conditional mutual information measures the performance of such recovery operations. More precisely, we prove that the conditional mutual information $I(A:C|B)$ of a tripartite quantum state $\rho_{ABC}$ can be bounded from below by its distance to the closest recovered state $\mathcal{R}_{B \to BC}(\rho_{AB})$, where the $C$-part is reconstructed from the $B$-part only and the recovery map $\mathcal{R}_{B \to BC}$ merely depends on $\rho_{BC}$. One particular application of this result implies the equivalence between two different approaches to define topological order in quantum systems."
356,1504.05155,2015,7,14,26,The Classification of Reversible Bit Operations,Scott Aaronson;Daniel Grier;Luke Schaeffer,"We present a complete classification of all possible sets of classical reversible gates acting on bits, in terms of which reversible transformations they generate, assuming swaps and ancilla bits are available for free. Our classification can be seen as the reversible-computing analogue of Post's lattice, a central result in mathematical logic from the 1940s. It is a step toward the ambitious goal of classifying all possible quantum gate sets acting on qubits. Our theorem implies a linear-time algorithm (which we have implemented), that takes as input the truth tables of reversible gates G and H, and that decides whether G generates H. Previously, this problem was not even known to be decidable. The theorem also implies that any n-bit reversible circuit can be ""compressed"" to an equivalent circuit, over the same gates, that uses at most 2^n*poly(n) gates and O(1) ancilla bits; these are the first upper bounds on these quantities known, and are close to optimal. Finally, the theorem implies that every non-degenerate reversible gate can implement either every reversible transformation, or every affine transformation, when restricted to an ""encoded subspace."" Briefly, the theorem says that every set of reversible gates generates either all reversible transformations on n-bit strings (as the Toffoli gate does); no transformations; all transformations that preserve Hamming weight (as the Fredkin gate does); all transformations that preserve Hamming weight mod k for some k; all affine transformations (as the Controlled-NOT gate does); all affine transformations that preserve Hamming weight mod 2 or mod 4, inner products mod 2, or a combination thereof; or a previous class augmented by a NOT or NOTNOT gate. Ruling out the possibility of additional classes, not in the list, requires some arguments about polynomials, lattices, and Diophantine equations."
357,1504.04617,2015,7,3,26,Quantum Coding with Finite Resources,Marco Tomamichel;Mario Berta;Joseph M Renes,"The quantum capacity of a memoryless channel is often used as a single figure of merit to characterize its ability to transmit quantum information coherently. The capacity determines the maximal rate at which we can code reliably over asymptotically many uses of the channel. We argue that this asymptotic treatment is insufficient to the point of being irrelevant in the quantum setting where decoherence severely limits our ability to manipulate large quantum systems in the encoder and decoder. For all practical purposes we should instead focus on the trade-off between three parameters: the rate of the code, the number of coherent uses of the channel, and the fidelity of the transmission. The aim is then to specify the region determined by allowed combinations of these parameters. Towards this goal, we find approximate and exact characterizations of the region of allowed triplets for the qubit dephasing channel and for the erasure channel with classical post-processing assistance. In each case the region is parametrized by a second channel parameter, the quantum channel dispersion. In the process we also develop several general inner (achievable) and outer (converse) bounds on the coding region that are valid for all finite-dimensional quantum channels and can be computed efficiently. Applied to the depolarizing channel, this allows us to determine a lower bound on the number of coherent uses of the channel necessary to witness super-additivity of the coherent information."
358,1504.04449,2015,6,24,26,Decoding quantum information via the Petz recovery map,Salman Beigi;Nilanjana Datta;Felix Leditzky,"We obtain a lower bound on the maximum number of qubits, $Q^{n, \varepsilon}({\mathcal{N}})$, which can be transmitted over $n$ uses of a quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$, for a given non-zero error threshold $\varepsilon$. To obtain our result, we first derive a bound on the one-shot entanglement transmission capacity of the channel, and then compute its asymptotic expansion up to the second order. In our method to prove this achievability bound, the decoding map, used by the receiver on the output of the channel, is chosen to be the Petz recovery map (also known as the transpose channel). Our result, in particular, shows that this choice of the decoder can be used to establish the coherent information as an achievable rate for quantum information transmission. Applying our achievability bound to the 50-50 erasure channel (which has zero quantum capacity), we find that there is a sharp error threshold above which $Q^{n, \varepsilon}({\mathcal{N}})$ scales as $\sqrt{n}$."
359,1503.00506,2015,4,29,26,The Role of Topology in Quantum Tomography,Michael Kech;Péter Vrana;Michael M Wolf,"We investigate quantum tomography in scenarios where prior information restricts the state space to a smooth manifold of lower dimensionality. By considering stability we provide a general framework that relates the topology of the manifold to the minimal number of binary measurement settings that is necessary to discriminate any two states on the manifold. We apply these findings to cases where the subset of states under consideration is given by states with bounded rank, fixed spectrum, given unitary symmetry or taken from a unitary orbit. For all these cases we provide both upper and lower bounds on the minimal number of binary measurement settings necessary to discriminate any two states of these subsets."
360,1412.2858,2014,4,21,26,Thermalization time bounds for Pauli stabilizer Hamiltonians,Kristan Temme,"We prove a general lower bound to the spectral gap of the Davies generator for Hamiltonians that can be written as the sum of commuting Pauli operators. These Hamiltonians, defined on the Hilbert space of $N$-qubits, serve as one of the most frequently considered candidates for a self-correcting quantum memory. A spectral gap bound on the Davies generator establishes an upper limit on the life time of such a quantum memory and can be used to estimate the time until the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium when brought into contact with a thermal heat bath. The bound can be shown to behave as $\lambda \geq {\cal O}(N^{-1}\exp(-2\beta \, \overline{\epsilon}))$, where $\overline{\epsilon}$ is a generalization of the well known energy barrier for logical operators. Particularly in the low temperature regime we expect this bound to provide the correct asymptotic scaling of the gap with the system size up to a factor of $N^{-1}$. Furthermore, we discuss conditions and provide scenarios where this factor can be removed and a constant lower bound can be proven"
361,1412.0333,2014,4,20,26,Multipartite quantum correlations and local recoverability,Mark M Wilde,"Characterizing genuine multipartite quantum correlations in quantum physical systems has historically been a challenging problem in quantum information theory. More recently however, the total correlation or multipartite information measure has been helpful in accomplishing this goal, especially with the multipartite symmetric quantum (MSQ) discord [Piani et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 090502, 2008] and the conditional entanglement of multipartite information (CEMI) [Yang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 140501, 2008]. Here we apply a recent and significant improvement of strong subadditivity of quantum entropy [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664] in order to develop these quantities further. In particular, we prove that the MSQ discord is nearly equal to zero if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated is approximately locally recoverable after performing measurements on each of its systems. Furthermore, we prove that the CEMI is a faithful entanglement measure, i.e., it vanishes if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated is a fully separable state. Along the way we provide an operational interpretation of the MSQ discord in terms of the partial state distribution protocol, which in turn, as a special case, gives an interpretation for the original discord quantity. Finally, we prove an inequality that could potentially improve upon the Fawzi-Renner inequality in the multipartite context, but it remains an open question to determine whether this is so."
362,1411.7380,2014,4,20,26,The Complexity of Divisibility,Johannes Bausch;Toby S Cubitt,"We address two sets of long-standing open questions in probability theory, from a computational complexity perspective: divisibility of stochastic maps, and divisibility and decomposability of probability distributions. We prove that finite divisibility of stochastic maps is an NP-complete problem, and extend this result to nonnegative matrices, and completely-positive trace-preserving maps, i.e. the quantum analogue of stochastic maps. We further prove a complexity hierarchy for the divisibility and decomposability of probability distributions, showing that finite distribution divisibility is in P, but decomposability is NP-hard. For the former, we give an explicit polynomial-time algorithm. All results on distributions extend to weak-membership formulations, proving that the complexity of these problems is robust to perturbations."
363,1405.0137,2014,3,3,26,On the informational completeness of local observables,Isaac H Kim,"For a general multipartite quantum state, we formulate a locally checkable condition, under which the expectation values of certain nonlocal observables are completely determined by the expectation values of some local observables. The condition is satisfied by ground states of gapped quantum many-body systems in two spatial dimensions, assuming a widely conjectured form of area law is correct. Its implications on the studies of gapped quantum many-body systems, quantum state tomography, and quantum state verification are discussed. These results are based on a partial characterization of states with small yet nonzero conditional mutual information, which may be of independent interest."
364,1210.6367,2012,12,10,26,Quantum de Finetti Theorems under Local Measurements with Applications,Fernando G S L Brandão;Aram W Harrow,"Quantum de Finetti theorems are a useful tool in the study of correlations in quantum multipartite states. In this paper we prove two new quantum de Finetti theorems, both showing that under tests formed by local measurements one can get a much improved error dependence on the dimension of the subsystems. We also obtain similar results for non-signaling probability distributions. We give the following applications of the results: We prove the optimality of the Chen-Drucker protocol for 3-SAT, under the exponential time hypothesis. We show that the maximum winning probability of free games can be estimated in polynomial time by linear programming. We also show that 3-SAT with m variables can be reduced to obtaining a constant error approximation of the maximum winning probability under entangled strategies of O(m^1/2)-player one-round non-local games, in which the players communicate O(m^1/2) bits all together. We show that the optimization of certain polynomials over the hypersphere can be performed in quasipolynomial time in the number of variables n by considering O(log(n)) rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy of semidefinite programs. As an application to entanglement theory, we find a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for deciding multipartite separability. We consider a result due to Aaronson -- showing that given an unknown n qubit state one can perform tomography that works well for most observables by measuring only O(n) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of the state -- and relax the assumption of having i.i.d copies of the state to merely the ability to select subsystems at random from a quantum multipartite state. The proofs of the new quantum de Finetti theorems are based on information theory, in particular on the chain rule of mutual information."
365,1504.05056,2015,12,2,25,Thermodynamic work from operational principles,Rodrigo Gallego;Jens Eisert;Henrik Wilming,"In recent years we have witnessed a concentrated effort to make sense of thermodynamics for small-scale systems. One of the main difficulties is to capture a suitable notion of work that models realistically the purpose of quantum machines, in an analogous way to the role played, for macroscopic machines, by the energy stored in the idealisation of a lifted weight. Despite of several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models, these are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum machine is expected to perform. In this work, we adopt a novel strategy by considering arbitrary kinds of systems that one can attach to a quantum thermal machine and seeking for work quantifiers. These are functions that measure the value of a transition and generalise the concept of work beyond the model of a lifted weight. We do so by imposing simple operational axioms that any reasonable work quantifier must fulfil and by deriving from them stringent mathematical condition with a clear physical interpretation. Our approach allows us to derive much of the structure of the theory of thermodynamics without taking as a primitive the definition of work. We can derive, for any work quantifier, a quantitative second law in the sense of bounding the work that can be performed using some non-equilibrium resource by the work that is needed to create it. We also discuss in detail the role of reversibility and correlations in connection with the second law. Furthermore, we recover the usual identification of work with energy in degrees of freedom with vanishing entropy as a particular case of our formalism. Our mathematical results can be formulated abstractly and are general enough to carry over to other resource theories than quantum thermodynamics."
366,1612.08091,2016,12,1,25,ProjectQ: An Open Source Software Framework for Quantum Computing,Damian S Steiger;Thomas Häner;Matthias Troyer,"We introduce ProjectQ, an open source software effort for quantum computing. The first release features a compiler framework capable of targeting various types of hardware, a high-performance simulator with emulation capabilities, and compiler plug-ins for circuit drawing and resource estimation. We introduce our Python-embedded domain-specific language, present the features, and provide example implementations for quantum algorithms. The framework allows testing of quantum algorithms through simulation and enables running them on actual quantum hardware using a back-end connecting to the IBM Quantum Experience cloud service. Through extension mechanisms, users can provide back-ends to further quantum hardware, and scientists working on quantum compilation can provide plug-ins for additional compilation, optimization, gate synthesis, and layout strategies."
367,1611.04256,2016,5,2,25,A linear-time benchmarking tool for generalized surface codes,Nicolas Delfosse;Pavithran Iyer;David Poulin,"Quantum information processors need to be protected against errors and faults. One of the most widely considered fault-tolerant architecture is based on surface codes. While the general principles of these codes are well understood and basic code properties such as minimum distance and rate are easy to characterize, a code's average performance depends on the detailed geometric layout of the qubits. To date, optimizing a surface code architecture and comparing different geometric layouts relies on costly numerical simulations. Here, we propose a benchmarking algorithm for simulating the performance of surface codes, and generalizations thereof, that runs in linear time. We implemented this algorithm in a software that generates performance reports and allows to quickly compare different architectures."
368,1608.07325,2016,10,24,25,From clocks to cloners: Catalytic transformations under covariant operations and recoverability,Iman Marvian;Seth Lloyd,"There are various physical scenarios in which one can only implement operations with a certain symmetry. Under such restriction, a system in a symmetry-breaking state can be used as a catalyst, e.g. to prepare another system in a desired symmetry-breaking state. This sort of (approximate) catalytic state transformations are relevant in the context of (i) state preparation using a bounded-size quantum clock or reference frame, where the clock or reference frame acts as a catalyst, (ii) quantum thermodynamics, where again a clock can be used as a catalyst to prepare states which contain coherence with respect to the system Hamiltonian, and (iii) cloning of unknown quantum states, where the given copies of state can be interpreted as a catalyst for preparing the new copies. Using a recent result of Fawzi and Renner on approximate recoverability, we show that the achievable accuracy in this kind of catalytic transformations can be determined by a single function, namely the relative entropy of asymmetry, which is equal to the difference between the entropy of state and its symmetrized version: if the desired state transition does not require a large increase of this quantity, then it can be implemented with high fidelity using only symmetric operations. Our lower bound on the achievable fidelity is tight in the case of cloners, and can be achieved using the Petz recovery map, which interestingly turns out to be the optimal cloning map found by Werner."
369,1606.02278,2016,4,21,25,Perfect Commuting-Operator Strategies for Linear System Games,Richard Cleve;Li Liu;William Slofstra,"Linear system games are a generalization of Mermin's magic square game introduced by Cleve and Mittal. They show that perfect strategies for linear system games in the tensor-product model of entanglement correspond to finite-dimensional operator solutions of a certain set of non-commutative equations. We investigate linear system games in the commuting-operator model of entanglement, where Alice and Bob's measurement operators act on a joint Hilbert space, and Alice's operators must commute with Bob's operators. We show that perfect strategies in this model correspond to possibly-infinite-dimensional operator solutions of the non-commutative equations. The proof is based around a finitely-presented group associated to the linear system which arises from the non-commutative equations."
370,1605.04601,2016,12,20,25,Lower bound on expected communication cost of quantum Huffman coding,Anurag Anshu;Ankit Garg;Aram W Harrow;Penghui Yao,"Data compression is a fundamental problem in quantum and classical information theory. A typical version of the problem is that the sender Alice receives a (classical or quantum) state from some known ensemble and needs to transmit it to the receiver Bob with average error below some specified bound. We consider the case in which the message can have a variable length and goal is to minimize its expected length. For classical case this problem has a well-known solution given by the Huffman coding. In this scheme, expected length of the message is equal to the Shannon entropy of the source (with a constant additive factor) and the protocol succeeds with zero error. This is a single-shot scheme from which the asymptotic result, viz. Shannon's source coding theorem, can be recovered by encoding each input state sequentially. For the quantum case, the asymptotic compression rate is given by the von-Neumann entropy. However, we show that there is no one-shot scheme which is able to match this rate, even if interactive communication is allowed. This is a relatively rare case in quantum information theory where the cost of a quantum task is significantly different from its classical analogue. Our result has implications for direct sum theorems in quantum communication complexity and one-shot formulations of Quantum Reverse Shannon theorem."
371,1605.03679,2016,8,29,25,Resilience to time-correlated noise in quantum computation,H Bombin,"Fault-tolerant quantum computation techniques rely on weakly correlated noise. Here I show that it is enough to assume weak spatial correlations: time correlations can take any form. In particular, single-shot error correction techniques exhibit a noise threshold for quantum memories under spatially local stochastic noise."
372,1603.07805,2016,6,8,25,Topological Order and Memory Time in Marginally Self-Correcting Quantum Memory,Karthik Siva;Beni Yoshida,"We examine two proposals for marginally self-correcting quantum memory, the cubic code by Haah and the welded code by Michnicki. In particular, we prove explicitly that they are absent of topological order above zero temperature, as their Gibbs ensembles can be prepared via a short-depth quantum circuit from classical ensembles. Our proof technique naturally gives rise to the notion of free energy associated with excitations. Further, we develop a framework for an ergodic decomposition of Davies generators in CSS codes which enables formal reduction to simpler classical memory problems. We then show that memory time in the welded code is doubly exponential in inverse temperature via the Peierls argument. These results introduce further connections between thermal topological order and self-correction from the viewpoint of free energy and quantum circuit depth."
373,1603.05182,2016,5,17,25,Fractal symmetries: Ungauging the cubic code,Dominic J Williamson,"Gauging is a ubiquitous tool in many-body physics. It allows one to construct highly entangled topological phases of matter from relatively simple phases and to relate certain characteristics of the two. Here we develop a gauging procedure for general submanifold symmetries of Pauli Hamiltonians, including symmetries of fractal type. We show a relation between the pre- and post-gauging models and use this to construct short-range entangled phases with fractal-like symmetries, one of which is mapped to the cubic code by the gauging."
374,1512.04930,2015,5,13,25,Popescu-Rohrlich correlations imply efficient instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation,Anne Broadbent,"In instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation, two parties cooperate in order to perform a quantum computation on their joint inputs, while being restricted to a single round of simultaneous communication. Previous results showed that instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation is possible, at the cost of an exponential amount of prior shared entanglement (in the size of the input). Here, we show that a linear amount of entanglement suffices, (in the size of the computation), as long as the parties share nonlocal correlations as given by the Popescu-Rohlich box. This means that communication is not required for efficient instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation. Exploiting the well-known relation to position-based cryptography, our result also implies the impossibility of secure position-based cryptography against adversaries with non-signalling correlations. Furthermore, our construction establishes a quantum analogue of the classical communication complexity collapse under non-signalling correlations."
375,1512.02615,2015,3,28,25,On Variational Expressions for Quantum Relative Entropies,Mario Berta;Omar Fawzi;Marco Tomamichel,"Distance measures between quantum states like the trace distance and the fidelity can naturally be defined by optimizing a classical distance measure over all measurement statistics that can be obtained from the respective quantum states. In contrast, Petz showed that the measured relative entropy, defined as a maximization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence over projective measurement statistics, is strictly smaller than Umegaki's quantum relative entropy whenever the states do not commute. We extend this result in two ways. First, we show that Petz' conclusion remains true if we allow general positive valued measures. To do this, we prove that maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence over general positive valued measures results in the measured relative entropy. Second, we extend the result to Rényi relative entropies and show that for non-commuting states the sandwiched Rényi relative entropy is strictly larger than the measured Rényi relative entropy for $\alpha \in (\frac12, \infty)$, and strictly smaller for $\alpha \in [0,\frac12)$. The latter statement provides counterexamples for the data-processing inequality of the sandwiched Rényi relative entropy for $\alpha < \frac12$. Our main tool is a new variational expression for the measured Rényi relative entropy, which we further exploit to show that certain lower bounds on quantum conditional mutual information are superadditive."

Bell's theorem states that this worldview is incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics, as is expressed in Bell's inequalities. Previous experiments convincingly supported the quantum predictions. Yet, every experiment requires assumptions that provide loopholes for a local realist explanation. Here we report a Bell test that closes the most significant of these loopholes simultaneously. Using a well-optimized source of entangled photons, rapid setting generation, and highly efficient superconducting detectors, we observe a violation of a Bell inequality with high statistical significance. The purely statistical probability of our results to occur under local realism does not exceed $3.74 \times 10^{-31}$, corresponding to an 11.5 standard deviation effect."

While it has been shown that such a quantum computer can in principle solve certain small electronic structure problems and idealized model Hamiltonians, the highly relevant problem of directly solving a complex correlated material appears to require a prohibitive amount of resources. Here, we show that by using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that incorporates the power of a small quantum computer into a framework of classical embedding algorithms, the electronic structure of complex correlated materials can be efficiently tackled using a quantum computer. In our approach, the quantum computer solves a small effective quantum impurity problem that is self-consistently determined via a feedback loop between the quantum and classical computation. Use of a quantum computer enables much larger and more accurate simulations than with any known classical algorithm, and will allow many open questions in quantum materials to be resolved once a small quantum computer with around one hundred logical qubits becomes available."
378,1510.02800,2015,11,11,25,Learning optimal quantum models is NP-hard,Cyril J Stark,"Physical modeling closes the gap between perception in terms of measurements and abstraction in terms of theoretical models. Physical modeling is a major objective in physics and is generally regarded as a creative process. How good are computers at solving this task? This question is both of philosophical and practical interest because a positive answer would allow an artificial intelligence to understand the physical world. Quantum mechanics is the most fundamental physical theory and there is a deep belief that nature follows the rules of quantum mechanics. Hence, we raise the question whether computers are able to learn optimal quantum models from measured data. Here we show that in the absence of physical heuristics, the inference of optimal quantum models cannot be computed efficiently (unless P = NP). This result illuminates rigorous limits to the extent to which computers can be used to further our understanding of nature."

For chiral CFTs, the approximation takes the form of a matrix product state. For full CFTs consisting of a chiral and an anti-chiral part, the approximation is given by a finitely correlated state. We show that the bond dimension scales polynomially in the inverse of the approximation error and sub-exponentially in the ultraviolett cutoff. We illustrate our findings using Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between group-covariant MPS and our approximation."
380,1509.05155,2015,10,13,25,Decoupling with random diagonal-unitary matrices,Yoshifumi Nakata;Christoph Hirche;Ciara Morgan;Andreas Winter,"We investigate decoupling, one of the most important primitives in quantum Shannon theory, by replacing the uniformly distributed random unitaries (and more specifically, unitary 2-designs) commonly used to achieve the protocol, with random diagonal-unitaries. In particular, we show that the alternate application of random diagonal-unitaries in the Pauli-$Z$ and -$X$ bases can achieve a decoupling rate equal to that achieved with uniformly distributed random unitaries. This strategy was recently shown to achieve an approximate unitary $2$-design after a number of repetitions of the process. This implies that the strategy gradually achieves decoupling. Here, we prove that even fewer repetitions of the process are sufficient to achieve decoupling. Based on this, we provide a simple quantum circuit achieving decoupling, which can be partitioned into a constant number of commuting parts. We also present applications of our decoupling theorem to coherent state merging and relative thermalization."
381,1507.07775,2015,9,25,25,"Tight uniform continuity bounds for quantum entropies: conditional entropy, relative entropy distance and energy constraints",Andreas Winter,"We present a bouquet of continuity bounds for quantum entropies, falling broadly into two classes: First, a tight analysis of the Alicki-Fannes continuity bounds for the conditional von Neumann entropy, reaching almost the best possible form that depends only on the system dimension and the trace distance of the states. Almost the same proof can be used to derive similar continuity bounds for the relative entropy distance from a convex set of states or positive operators. As applications we give new proofs, with tighter bounds, of the asymptotic continuity of the relative entropy of entanglement, $E_R$, and its regularization $E_R^\infty$, as well as of the entanglement of formation, $E_F$. Using a novel ""quantum coupling"" of density operators, which may be of independent interest, we extend the latter to an asymptotic continuity bound for the regularized entanglement of formation, aka entanglement cost, $E_C=E_F^\infty$. Second, analogous continuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and conditional entropy in infinite dimensional systems under an energy constraint, most importantly systems of multiple quantum harmonic oscillators. While without an energy bound the entropy is discontinuous, it is well-known to be continuous on states of bounded energy. However, a quantitative statement to that effect seems not to have been known. Here, under some regularity assumptions on the Hamiltonian, we find that, quite intuitively, the Gibbs entropy at the given energy roughly takes the role of the Hilbert space dimension in the finite-dimensional Fannes inequality."

This construction results in two-dimensional quantum codes whose tradeoff of encoding rate versus protection is more favorable than for the surface code. These surface codes would require variable length connections between qubits, as determined by the hyperbolic geometry. We provide numerical estimates of the value of the noise threshold and logical error probability of these codes against independent X or Z noise, assuming noise-free error correction."

For 2, 3, and 4 regions, we prove that the strong subadditivity and the monogamy of mutual information give the complete set of inequalities. This is in contrast to the situation for generic quantum systems, where a complete set of entropy inequalities is not known for 4 or more regions. We also find an infinite new family of inequalities applicable to 5 or more regions. The set of all holographic entropy inequalities bounds the phase space of Ryu-Takayanagi entropies, defining the holographic entropy cone. We characterize this entropy cone by reducing geometries to minimal graph models that encode the possible cutting and gluing relations of minimal surfaces. We find that, for a fixed number of regions, there are only finitely many independent entropy inequalities. To establish new holographic entropy inequalities, we introduce a combinatorial proof technique that may also be of independent interest in Riemannian geometry and graph theory."

To show this, we strengthen a previous result by establishing QMA-completeness for approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on simple graphs. Using a connection between the XY and Bose-Hubbard models that we exploited in previous work, this establishes QMA-completeness of the XY model."

In many experimental architectures, the C-NOT gate is relatively 'expensive' and hence we aim to keep the number of these as low as possible. We derive a theoretical lower bound on the number of C-NOT gates required to decompose an arbitrary isometry from m to n qubits, and give three explicit gate decompositions that achieve this bound up to a factor of about two in the leading order. We also perform some bespoke optimizations for certain cases where m and n are small. In addition, we show how to apply our result for isometries to give a decomposition scheme for an arbitrary quantum operation via Stinespring's theorem, and derive a lower bound on the number of C-NOTs in this case too. These results will have an impact on experimental efforts to build a quantum computer, enabling them to go further with the same resources."

Their algorithm takes as input an exactly synthesizable single-qubit unitary--one which can be expressed without error as a product of Clifford and T gates--and outputs a sequence of gates which implements it. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that the length of the sequence, measured by the number of T gates, is smallest possible. In this paper, for each positive even integer $n$ we consider the ""Clifford-cyclotomic"" gate set consisting of the Clifford group plus a z-rotation by $\frac{\pi}{n}$. We present an efficient exact synthesis algorithm which outputs a decomposition using the minimum number of $\frac{\pi}{n}$ z-rotations. For the Clifford+T case $n=4$ the group of exactly synthesizable unitaries was shown to be equal to the group of unitaries with entries over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[e^{i\frac{\pi}{n}},1/2]$. We prove that this characterization holds for a handful of other small values of $n$ but the fraction of positive even integers for which it fails to hold is 100%."
387,1409.7246,2014,1,29,25,Polar codes in network quantum information theory,Christoph Hirche;Ciara Morgan;Mark M Wilde,"Polar coding is a method for communication over noisy classical channels which is provably capacity-achieving and has an efficient encoding and decoding. Recently, this method has been generalized to the realm of quantum information processing, for tasks such as classical communication, private classical communication, and quantum communication. In the present work, we apply the polar coding method to network quantum information theory, by making use of recent advances for related classical tasks. In particular, we consider problems such as the compound multiple access channel and the quantum interference channel. The main result of our work is that it is possible to achieve the best known inner bounds on the achievable rate regions for these tasks, without requiring a so-called quantum simultaneous decoder. Thus, our work paves the way for developing network quantum information theory further without requiring a quantum simultaneous decoder."
388,1408.5728,2014,1,21,25,Sinkhorn normal form for unitary matrices,Martin Idel;Michael M Wolf,"Sinkhorn proved that every entry-wise positive matrix can be made doubly stochastic by multiplying with two diagonal matrices. In this note we prove a recently conjectured analogue for unitary matrices: every unitary can be decomposed into two diagonal unitaries and one whose row- and column sums are equal to one. The proof is non-constructive and based on a reformulation in terms of symplectic topology. As a corollary, we obtain a decomposition of unitary matrices into an interlaced product of unitary diagonal matrices and discrete Fourier transformations. This provides a new decomposition of linear optics arrays into phase shifters and canonical multiports described by Fourier transformations."
389,1407.8217,2014,9,26,25,Communication tasks with infinite quantum-classical separation,Christopher Perry;Rahul Jain;Jonathan Oppenheim,"Quantum resources can be more powerful than classical resources - a quantum computer can solve certain problems exponentially faster than a classical computer, and computing a function of two people's inputs can be done with exponentially less communication with quantum messages than with classical ones. Here we consider a task between two players, Alice and Bob where quantum resources are infinitely more powerful than classical ones. Alice is given a string of length n, and Bob's task is to exclude certain combinations of bits that Alice might have. If Alice must send classical messages, then she must reveal nearly n bits of information to Bob, but if she is allowed to send quantum bits, the amount of information she must reveal goes to zero with increasing n. Next, we consider a version of the task where the parties can only send classical messages but may have access to entanglement. When assisted by entanglement, Alice only needs to send a constant number of bits, while without entanglement, the number of bits Alice must send grows linearly with n. The task is related to the PBR theorem which arises in the context of the foundations of quantum theory."
390,1407.2926,2014,8,26,25,An invariant of topologically ordered states under local unitary transformations,Jeongwan Haah,"For an anyon model in two spatial dimensions described by a modular tensor category, the topological S-matrix encodes the mutual braiding statistics, the quantum dimensions, and the fusion rules of anyons. It is nontrivial whether one can compute the S-matrix from a single ground state wave function. Here, we define a class of Hamiltonians consisting of local commuting projectors and an associated matrix that is invariant under local unitary transformations. We argue that the invariant is equivalent to the topological S-matrix. The definition does not require degeneracy of the ground state. We prove that the invariant depends on the state only, in the sense that it can be computed by any Hamiltonian in the class of which the state is a ground state. As a corollary, we prove that any local quantum circuit that connects two ground states of quantum double models (discrete gauge theories) with non-isomorphic abelian groups, must have depth that is at least linear in the system's diameter. As a tool for the proof, a manifestly Hamiltonian-independent notion of locally invisible operators is introduced. This gives a sufficient condition for a many-body state not to be generated from a product state by any small depth quantum circuit; this is a many-body entanglement witness."

We prove that random Clifford circuits with $O(n \log^2 n)$ gates can be used to encode $k$ qubits in $n$ qubits with a distance $d$ provided $\frac{k}{n} < 1 - \frac{d}{n} \log_2 3 - h(\frac{d}{n})$. In addition, we prove that such circuits typically have a depth of $O( \log^3 n)$."
392,1310.8640,2013,7,11,25,Generic emergence of classical features in quantum Darwinism,Fernando G S L Brandão;Marco Piani;Paweł Horodecki,"Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of classical reality from the underlying quantum reality by the fact that a quantum system is observed indirectly, by looking at parts of its environment, so that only specific information about the system that is redundantly proliferated to many parts of the environment becomes accessible and objective. However it is not clear under what conditions this mechanism holds true. Here we rigorously prove that the emergence of classicality is a general feature of any quantum dynamics: observers who acquire information about a quantum system indirectly have access at most to classical information about one and the same measurement of the quantum system; moreover, if such information is available to many observers, they necessarily agree. Remarkably, our analysis goes beyond the system-environment categorization. We also provide a full characterization of the so-called quantum discord in terms of local redistribution of correlations."

394,1612.05649,2016,11,1,24,Semiclassical Formulation of Gottesman-Knill and Universal Quantum Computation,Lucas Kocia;Peter J Love,"We give a path integral formulation of the time evolution of qudits of odd dimension. This allows us to consider semiclassical evolution of discrete systems in terms of an expansion of the propagator in powers of $\hbar$. The largest power of $\hbar$ required to describe the evolution is a traditional measure of classicality. We show that the action of the Clifford operators on stabilizer states can be fully described by a single contribution of a path integral truncated at order $\hbar^0$ and so are ""classical,"" just like propagation of Gaussians under harmonic Hamiltonians in the continuous case. Such operations have no dependence on phase or quantum interference. Conversely, we show that supplementing the Clifford group with gates necessary for universal quantum computation results in a propagator that can be fully treated by a sum consisting of a finite number of semiclassical path integral contributions truncated at order $\hbar^1$, a number that nevertheless scales exponentially with the number of qudits. The same sum in continuous systems has an infinite number of terms at order $\hbar^1$."
395,1611.01516,2016,2,8,24,Entanglement from Topology in Chern-Simons Theory,Grant Salton;Brian Swingle;Michael Walter,"The way in which geometry encodes entanglement is a topic of much recent interest in quantum many-body physics and the AdS/CFT duality. This relation is particularly pronounced in the case of topological quantum field theories, where topology alone determines the quantum states of the theory. In this work, we study the set of quantum states that can be prepared by the Euclidean path integral in three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Specifically, we consider arbitrary 3-manifolds with a fixed number of torus boundaries in both abelian U(1) and non-abelian SO(3) Chern-Simons theory. For the abelian theory, we find that the states that can be prepared coincide precisely with the set of stabilizer states from quantum information theory. This constrains the multipartite entanglement present in this theory, but it also reveals that stabilizer states can be described by topology. In particular, we find an explicit expression for the entanglement entropy of a many-torus subsystem using only a single replica, as well as a concrete formula for the number of GHZ states that can be distilled from a tripartite state prepared through path integration. For the nonabelian theory, we find a notion of ""state universality"", namely that any state can be prepared to an arbitrarily good approximation. The manifolds we consider can also be viewed as toy models of multi-boundary wormholes in AdS/CFT."
396,1610.05296,2016,11,29,24,Efficiently characterizing the total error in quantum circuits,Arnaud C Dugas;Joel J Wallman;Joseph Emerson,"Current methods of characterizing quantum devices focus on diagnosing individual components. While important, this falls short of the primary goal, namely, determining when the total noise in a quantum circuit is sufficiently small, so that the output of a quantum computer is reliable. In this work, we first obtain an optimal bound on the total fidelity of a circuit in terms of the component fidelities, which can be efficiently estimated by randomized benchmarking. This optimal bound grows quadratically in the length of the circuit. We then obtain an improved bound using additional information about the noise, namely, the unitarity, which can also be efficiently estimated. This improved bound smoothly interpolates between the worst-case quadratic and best-case linear scalings. We then show that our analysis substantially improves the bounds on the infidelities of individual gates obtained using interleaved randomized benchmarking."
397,1610.03632,2016,11,8,24,Noise Threshold of Quantum Supremacy,Keisuke Fujii,"Demonstrating quantum supremacy, a complexity-guaranteed quantum advantage against over the best classical algorithms by using less universal quantum devices, is an important near-term milestone for quantum information processing. Here we develop a threshold theorem for quantum supremacy with noisy quantum circuits in the pre-threshold region, where quantum error correction does not work directly. We show that, even in such a region, we can virtually simulate quantum error correction by postselection. This allows us to show that the output sampled from the noisy quantum circuits (without postselection) cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computers based on a stable complexity theoretical conjecture, i.e., non-collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. By applying this to fault-tolerant quantum computation with the surface codes, we obtain the threshold value $2.84\%$ for quantum supremacy, which is much higher than the standard threshold $0.75\%$ for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with the same circuit-level noise model. Moreover, contrast to the standard noise threshold, the origin of quantum supremacy in noisy quantum circuits is quite clear; the threshold is determined purely by the threshold of magic state distillation, which is essential to gain a quantum advantage."
398,1610.01337,2016,10,18,24,Thermalization and Return to Equilibrium on Finite Quantum Lattice Systems,Terry Farrelly;Fernando G S L Brandão;Marcus Cramer,"Thermal states are the bedrock of statistical physics. Nevertheless, when and how they actually arise in closed quantum systems is not fully understood. We consider this question for systems with local Hamiltonians on finite quantum lattices. In a first step, we show that states with exponentially decaying correlations equilibrate after a quantum quench. Then we show that the equilibrium state is locally equivalent to a thermal state, provided that the free energy of the equilibrium state is sufficiently small and the thermal state has exponentially decaying correlations. As an application, we look at a related important question: When are thermal states stable against noise? In other words, if we locally disturb a closed quantum system in a thermal state, will it return to thermal equilibrium? We rigorously show that this occurs when the correlations in the thermal state are exponentially decaying. All our results come with finite-size bounds, which are crucial for the growing field of quantum thermodynamics and other physical applications."
399,1608.04508,2016,10,13,24,Separation between quantum Lovász number and entanglement-assisted zero-error classical capacity,Xin Wang;Runyao Duan,"Quantum Lovász number, as a natural generalization of the celebrated Lovász number in graph theory, is the best known efficiently computable upper bound of the entanglement-assisted zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel. However, it remains an intriguing open problem whether this number always coincides with the entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity. Here we show that there is a strict gap between these two quantities for a class of explicitly constructed qutrit-to-qutrit channels. Our key approach is to show that for this class of channels both the one-shot zero-error communication capacity and the one-shot zero-error simulation cost in the presence of quantum no-signalling correlations (QNSC), a more broader class of resources than entanglement, are exactly four, while the quantum Lovász number is strictly larger than that. Interestingly, for this class of channels, the quantum fractional packing number is strictly larger than the QNSC-assisted or quantum feedback-assisted zero-error classical capacity. Note that these quantities are all equal for classical channels."
400,1608.02943,2016,10,6,24,Estimating the fidelity of T gates using standard interleaved randomized benchmarking,Robin Harper;Steven T Flammia,"Randomized benchmarking (RB) is an important protocol for robustly characterizing the error rates of quantum gates. The technique is typically applied to the Clifford gates since they form a group that satisfies a convenient technical condition of forming a unitary 2-design, in addition to having a tight connection to fault-tolerant quantum computing and an efficient classical simulation. In order to achieve universal quantum computing one must add at least one additional gate such as the T gate (also known as the $\pi$/8 gate). Here we propose and analyze a simple variation of the standard interleaved RB protocol that can accurately estimate the average fidelity of the T gate while retaining the many advantages of a unitary 2-design and the fidelity guarantees that such a design delivers, as well as the efficient classical simulation property of the Clifford group. Our work complements prior methods that have succeeded in estimating T gate fidelities, but only by relaxing the 2-design constraint and using a more complicated data analysis."
401,1607.03637,2016,8,17,24,Can a quantum state over time resemble a quantum state at a single time?,Dominic C Horsman;Chris Heunen;Matthew F Pusey;Jonathan Barrett;Robert W Spekkens,"Standard quantum theory represents a composite system at a given time by a joint state, but it does not prescribe a joint state for a composite of systems at different times. If a more even-handed treatment of space and time is possible, then such a joint state should be definable, and one might expect it to satisfy the following five conditions: that it is a Hermitian operator on the tensor product of the single-time Hilbert spaces; that it represents probabilistic mixing appropriately; that it has the appropriate classical limit; that it has the appropriate single-time marginals; that composing over multiple time-steps is associative. We show that no construction satisfies all these requirements. If an even-handed treatment of space and time is possible, therefore, one or more axioms must be dropped. In particular, if Hermiticity is dropped, then we show that the construction is fixed uniquely up to an ordering convention."
402,1607.00041,2016,8,11,24,Sandwiched Rényi Convergence for Quantum Evolutions,Alexander Müller-Hermes;Daniel Stilck Franca,We study the speed of convergence of a primitive quantum time evolution towards its fixed point in the distance of sandwiched Rényi divergences. For each of these distance measures the convergence is typically exponentially fast and the best exponent is given by a constant (similar to a logarithmic Sobolev constant) depending only on the generator of the time evolution. We establish relations between these constants and the logarithmic Sobolev constants as well as the spectral gap. An important consequence of these relations is the derivation of mixing time bounds for time evolutions directly from logarithmic Sobolev inequalities without relying on notions like lp-regularity. We also derive strong converse bounds for the classical capacity of a quantum time evolution.
403,1606.07413,2016,7,14,24,Parallelizing quantum circuit synthesis,Olivia Di Matteo;Michele Mosca,"Quantum circuit synthesis is the process in which an arbitrary unitary operation is decomposed into a sequence of gates from a universal set, typically one which a quantum computer can implement both efficiently and fault-tolerantly. As physical implementations of quantum computers improve, the need is growing for tools which can effectively synthesize components of the circuits and algorithms they will run. Existing algorithms for exact, multi-qubit circuit synthesis scale exponentially in the number of qubits and circuit depth, leaving synthesis intractable for circuits on more than a handful of qubits. Even modest improvements in circuit synthesis procedures may lead to significant advances, pushing forward the boundaries of not only the size of solvable circuit synthesis problems, but also in what can be realized physically as a result of having more efficient circuits. We present a method for quantum circuit synthesis using deterministic walks. Also termed pseudorandom walks, these are walks in which once a starting point is chosen, its path is completely determined. We apply our method to construct a parallel framework for circuit synthesis, and implement one such version performing optimal $T$-count synthesis over the Clifford+$T$ gate set. We use our software to present examples where parallelization offers a significant speedup on the runtime, as well as directly confirm that the 4-qubit 1-bit full adder has optimal $T$-count 7 and $T$-depth 3."
404,1606.05565,2016,7,6,24,Where does quantum uncertainty come from?,Filip Rozpędek;Jędrzej Kaniewski;Patrick J Coles;Stephanie Wehner,"The quantum uncertainty principle famously predicts that there exist measurements that are inherently incompatible, in the sense that their outcomes cannot be predicted simultaneously. In contrast, no such uncertainty exists in the classical domain, where all uncertainty results from ignorance about the exact state of the physical system. Here, we critically examine the concept of preparation uncertainty and ask whether similarly in the quantum regime, some of the uncertainty that we observe can actually also be understood as a lack of information, albeit a lack of quantum information. We answer this question affirmatively by showing that for the well known measurements employed in BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD), the amount of uncertainty can indeed be related to the amount of available information about additional registers determining the choice of the measurement. We proceed to show that also for other measurements the amount of uncertainty is in part connected to a lack of information. Finally, we discuss the conceptual implications of our observation to the security of cryptographic protocols that make use of BB84 states."
405,1606.04085,2016,7,4,24,Tensor surgery and tensor rank,Matthias Christandl;Jeroen Zuiddam,"We introduce a method for transforming low-order tensors into higher-order tensors and apply it to tensors defined by graphs and hypergraphs. The transformation proceeds according to a surgery-like procedure that splits vertices, creates and absorbs virtual edges and inserts new vertices and edges. We show that tensor surgery is capable of preserving the low rank structure of an initial tensor decomposition and thus allows to prove nontrivial upper bounds on tensor rank, border rank and asymptotic rank of the final tensors. We illustrate our method with a number of examples. Tensor surgery on the triangle graph, which corresponds to the matrix multiplication tensor, leads to nontrivial rank upper bounds for all odd cycle graphs, which correspond to the tensors of iterated matrix multiplication. In the asymptotic setting we obtain upper bounds in terms of the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ and the rectangular matrix multiplication parameter $\alpha$. These bounds are optimal if $\omega$ equals two. We also give examples that illustrate that tensor surgery on general graphs might involve the absorption of virtual hyperedges and we provide an example of tensor surgery on a hypergraph. In the context of quantum information theory, our results may be interpreted as upper bounds on the number of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states needed in order to create a network of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states by stochastic local operations and classical communication. They also imply new upper bounds on the nondeterministic quantum communication complexity of the equality problem when played among pairs of players."
406,1606.00608,2016,6,24,24,Matrix Product Density Operators: Renormalization Fixed Points and Boundary Theories,J Ignacio Cirac;David Pérez-García;Norbert Schuch;Frank Verstraete,"We consider the tensors generating matrix product states and density operators in a spin chain. For pure states, we revise the renormalization procedure introduced by F. Verstraete et al. in 2005 and characterize the tensors corresponding to the fixed points. We relate them to the states possessing zero correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate ground states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. For mixed states, we introduce the concept of renormalization fixed points and characterize the corresponding tensors. We also relate them to concepts like finite correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate Gibbs states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. One of the main result of this work is that the resulting fixed points can be associated to the boundary theories of two-dimensional topological states, through the bulk-boundary correspondence introduced by Cirac et al. in 2011."
407,1605.09013,2016,6,20,24,Flexible constrained de Finetti reductions and applications,Cécilia Lancien;Andreas Winter,"De Finetti theorems show how sufficiently exchangeable states are well-approximated by convex combinations of i.i.d. states. Recently, it was shown that in many quantum information applications a more relaxed de Finetti reduction (i.e. only a matrix inequality between the symmetric state and one of de Finetti form) is enough, and that it leads to more concise and elegant arguments. Here we show several uses and general flexible applicability of a constrained de Finetti reduction in quantum information theory, which was recently discovered by Duan, Severini and Winter. In particular we show that the technique can accommodate other symmetries commuting with the permutation action, and permutation-invariant linear constraints. We then demonstrate that, in some cases, it is also fruitful with convex constraints, in particular separability in a bipartite setting. This is a constraint particularly interesting in the context of the complexity class $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ of interactive quantum Merlin-Arthur games with unentangled provers, and our results relate to the soundness gap amplification of $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ protocols by parallel repetition. It is also relevant for the regularization of certain entropic channel parameters. Finally, we explore an extension to infinite-dimensional systems, which usually pose inherent problems to de Finetti techniques in the quantum case."
408,1605.03266,2016,6,14,24,A Quantum Approach to the Unique Sink Orientation Problem,Dave Bacon,"We consider quantum algorithms for the unique sink orientation problem on cubes. This problem is widely considered to be of intermediate computational complexity. This is because there no known polynomial algorithm (classical or quantum) from the problem and yet it arrises as part of a series of problems for which it being intractable would imply complexity theoretic collapses. We give a reduction which proves that if one can efficiently evaluate the kth power of the unique sink orientation outmap, then there exists a polynomial time quantum algorithm for the unique sink orientation problem on cubes."
409,1604.07199,2016,6,3,24,Completely positive semidefinite rank,Anupam Prakash;Jamie Sikora;Antonios Varvitsiotis;Zhaohui Wei,"An $n\times n$ matrix $X$ is called completely positive semidefinite (cpsd) if there exist $d\times d$ Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ (for some $d\ge 1$) such that $X_{ij}= {\rm Tr}(P_iP_j),$ for all $i,j \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$. The cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix is the smallest $d\ge 1$ for which such a representation is possible. In this work we initiate the study of the cpsd-rank which we motivate twofold. First, the cpsd-rank is a natural non-commutative analogue of the completely positive rank of a completely positive matrix. Second, we show that the cpsd-rank is physically motivated as it can be used to upper and lower bound the size of a quantum system needed to generate a quantum behavior. In this work we present several properties of the cpsd-rank. Unlike the completely positive rank which is at most quadratic in the size of the matrix, no general upper bound is known on the cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix. In fact, we show that the cpsd-rank can be exponential in terms of the size. Specifically, for any $n\ge1,$ we construct a cpsd matrix of size $2n$ whose cpsd-rank is $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$. Our construction is based on Gram matrices of Lorentz cone vectors, which we show are cpsd. The proof relies crucially on the connection between the cpsd-rank and quantum behaviors. In particular, we use a known lower bound on the size of matrix representations of extremal quantum correlations which we apply to high-rank extreme points of the $n$-dimensional elliptope. Lastly, we study cpsd-graphs, i.e., graphs $G$ with the property that every doubly nonnegative matrix whose support is given by $G$ is cpsd. We show that a graph is cpsd if and only if it has no odd cycle of length at least $5$ as a subgraph. This coincides with the characterization of cp-graphs."
410,1603.06049,2016,5,31,24,How local is the information in MPS/PEPS tensor networks?,Anurag Anshu;Itai Arad;Aditya Jain,"Two dimensional tensor networks such as projected entangled pairs states (PEPS) are generally hard to contract. This is arguably the main reason why variational tensor network methods in 2D are still not as successful as in 1D. However, this is not necessarily the case if the tensor network represents a gapped ground state of a local Hamiltonian; such states are subject to many constraints and contain much more structure. In this paper we introduce a new approach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in ground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS tensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to estimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network around the observable. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this is often easier to do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the spanning vectors of the local patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a semi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the expectation value. We test our approach in 1D systems, where we show how the expectation value can be calculated up to at least 3 or 4 digits of precision, even when the patch radius is smaller than the correlation length."
411,1601.07940,2016,5,12,24,Improved Semidefinite Programming Upper Bound on Distillable Entanglement,Xin Wang;Runyao Duan,"A new additive and semidefinite programming (SDP) computable entanglement measure is introduced to upper bound the amount of distillable entanglement in bipartite quantum states by operations completely preserving the positivity of partial transpose (PPT). This quantity is always smaller than or equal to the logarithmic negativity, the previously best known SDP bound on distillable entanglement, and the inequality is strict in general. Furthermore, a succinct SDP characterization of the one-copy PPT deterministic distillable entanglement for any given state is also obtained, which provides a simple but useful lower bound on the PPT distillable entanglement. Remarkably, there is a genuinely mixed state of which both bounds coincide with the distillable entanglement while being strictly less than the logarithmic negativity."
412,1512.07892,2015,4,26,24,Further extensions of Clifford circuits and their classical simulation complexities,Dax Enshan Koh,"Extended Clifford circuits straddle the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Whether such circuits are efficiently classically simulable seems to depend delicately on the ingredients of the circuits. While some combinations of ingredients lead to efficiently classically simulable circuits, other combinations that might just be slightly different, lead to circuits which are likely not. We extend the results of Jozsa and Van den Nest (arXiv:1305.6190) by studying two further extensions of Clifford circuits. Firstly, we consider how the classical simulation complexity changes when we allow for more general measurements. Secondly, we investigate different notions of what it means to ""classically simulate"" a quantum circuit. These further extensions give us 24 new combinations of ingredients compared to Jozsa and Van den Nest, and we give a complete classification of their classical simulation complexities. Our results provide more examples where seemingly modest changes to the ingredients of Clifford circuits lead to large changes in the classical simulation complexity under plausible complexity assumptions."
413,1512.01210,2015,3,22,24,Nearly optimal separations between communication (or query) complexity and partitions,Robin Kothari,"We show a nearly quadratic separation between deterministic communication complexity and the logarithm of the partition number, which is essentially optimal. This improves upon a recent power 1.5 separation of Göös, Pitassi, and Watson (FOCS 2015). In query complexity, we establish a nearly quadratic separation between deterministic (and even randomized) query complexity and subcube partition complexity, which is also essentially optimal. We also establish a nearly power 1.5 separation between quantum query complexity and subcube partition complexity, the first superlinear separation between the two measures. Lastly, we show a quadratic separation between quantum query complexity and one-sided subcube partition complexity. Our query complexity separations use the recent cheat sheet framework of Aaronson, Ben-David, and the author. Our query functions are built up in stages by alternating function composition with the cheat sheet construction. The communication complexity separation follows from lifting the query separation to communication complexity."

We interpret this architecture as a classical error-correcting code, which is highly robust against weakly correlated bit-flip noise, and we analyze the code's performance using a belief-propagation decoding algorithm. Our observations may also apply to more general encoding schemes and noise models."

In such games, the winning conditions for Alice and Bob may depend on outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part of the shared quantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to randomly selected questions. Our study of this class of games was inspired by the monogamy-of-entanglement games introduced by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski, and Wehner, which they also generalize. We prove that a natural extension of the Navascues--Pironio--Acin hierarchy of semidefinite programs converges to the optimal commuting operator value of extended nonlocal games, and we prove two extensions of results of Tomamichel et al. concerning monogamy-of-entanglement games."
416,1510.01406,2015,12,4,24,Qubit metrology for building a fault-tolerant quantum computer,John M Martinis,"Recent progress in quantum information has led to the start of several large national and industrial efforts to build a quantum computer. Researchers are now working to overcome many scientific and technological challenges. The program's biggest obstacle, a potential showstopper for the entire effort, is the need for high-fidelity qubit operations in a scalable architecture. This challenge arises from the fundamental fragility of quantum information, which can only be overcome with quantum error correction. In a fault-tolerant quantum computer the qubits and their logic interactions must have errors below a threshold: scaling up with more and more qubits then brings the net error probability down to appropriate levels ~ $10^{-18}$ needed for running complex algorithms. Reducing error requires solving problems in physics, control, materials and fabrication, which differ for every implementation. I explain here the common key driver for continued improvement - the metrology of qubit errors."
417,1509.03626,2015,11,3,24,"Gapped boundaries, group cohomology and fault-tolerant logical gates",Beni Yoshida,"This paper attempts to establish the connection among classifications of gapped boundaries in topological phases of matter, bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates in quantum error-correcting codes. We begin by presenting constructions of gapped boundaries for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycles functions ($d\geq 2$). We point out that the system supports $m$-dimensional excitations ($m<d$), which we shall call fluctuating charges, that are superpositions of point-like electric charges characterized by $m$-dimensional bosonic SPT wavefunctions. There exist gapped boundaries where electric charges or magnetic fluxes may not condense by themselves, but may condense only when accompanied by fluctuating charges. Magnetic fluxes and codimension-$2$ fluctuating charges exhibit non-trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, involving more than two excitations. The statistical angle can be computed by taking slant products of underlying cocycle functions sequentially. We find that excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary can be characterized by trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, generalizing the notion of the Lagrangian subgroup. As an application, we construct fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycle functions. Namely, corresponding logical gates belong to the $d$th level of the Clifford hierarchy, but are outside of the $(d-1)$th level, if cocycle functions have non-trivial sequences of slant products."
418,1508.00860,2015,10,9,24,How to combine three quantum states,Maris Ozols,"We devise a ternary operation for combining three quantum states: it consists of permuting the input systems in a continuous fashion and then discarding all but one of them. This generalizes a binary operation recently studied by Audenaert et al. [arXiv:1503.04213] in the context of entropy power inequalities. In fact, our ternary operation continuously interpolates between all such nested binary operations. Our construction is based on a unitary version of Cayley's theorem: we use representation theory to show that any finite group can be naturally embedded in a continuous subgroup of the unitary group. Formally, this amounts to characterizing when a linear combination of certain permutations is unitary."
419,1507.08969,2015,10,7,24,Towards Practical Quantum Variational Algorithms,David Wecker;Matthew B Hastings;Matthias Troyer,"The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin-orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation."

Under certain conditions, identified by Turaev, the appropriately normalized trace of these representations yields a link invariant. Any Yang-Baxter solution can be interpreted as a two-qudit quantum gate. Here we show that if this gate is non-entangling, then the resulting invariant of knots is trivial. We thus obtain a general connection between topological entanglement and quantum entanglement, as suggested by Kauffman et al."
421,1503.07208,2015,8,5,24,Topological color code and symmetry-protected topological phases,Beni Yoshida,"We study $(d-1)$-dimensional excitations in the $d$-dimensional color code that are created by transversal application of the $R_{d}$ phase operators on connected subregions of qubits. We find that such excitations are superpositions of electric charges and can be characterized by fixed-point wavefunctions of $(d-1)$-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with $(\mathbb{Z}_{2})^{\otimes d}$ symmetry. While these SPT excitations are localized on $(d-1)$-dimensional boundaries, their creation requires operations acting on all qubits inside the boundaries, reflecting the non-triviality of emerging SPT wavefunctions. Moreover, these SPT-excitations can be physically realized as transparent gapped domain walls which exchange excitations in the color code. Namely, in the three-dimensional color code, the domain wall, associated with the transversal $R_{3}$ operator, exchanges a magnetic flux and a composite of a magnetic flux and loop-like SPT excitation, revealing rich possibilities of boundaries in higher-dimensional TQFTs. We also find that magnetic fluxes and loop-like SPT excitations exhibit non-trivial three-loop braiding statistics in three dimensions as a result of the fact that the $R_{3}$ phase operator belongs to the third-level of the Clifford hierarchy. We believe that the connection between SPT excitations, fault-tolerant logical gates and gapped domain walls, established in this paper, can be generalized to a large class of topological quantum codes and TQFTs."
422,1503.05203,2015,8,3,24,Weak values in a classical theory with an epistemic restriction,Angela Karanjai;Eric G Cavalcanti;Stephen D Bartlett;Terry G Rudolph,"Weak measurement of a quantum system followed by postselection based on a subsequent strong measurement gives rise to a quantity called the weak value: a complex number for which the interpretation has long been debated. We analyse the procedure of weak measurement and postselection, and the interpretation of the associated weak value, using a theory of classical mechanics supplemented by an epistemic restriction that is known to be operationally equivalent to a subtheory of quantum mechanics. Both the real and imaginary components of the weak value appear as phase space displacements in the postselected expectation values of the measurement device's position and momentum distributions, and we recover the same displacements as in the quantum case by studying the corresponding evolution in the classical theory. By using this analogous classical theory, we gain insight into the appearance of the weak value as a result of the statistical effects of post selection, and this provides us with an operational interpretation of the weak value, both its real and imaginary parts. We find that the imaginary part of the weak value is a measure of how much postselection biases the mean phase space distribution for a given amount of measurement disturbance. All such biases proportional to the imaginary part of the weak value vanish in the limit where disturbance due to measurement goes to zero. Our analysis also offers intuitive insight into how measurement disturbance can be minimised and the limits of weak measurement."

In contrast, information-theoretic entropy, introduced by Shannon, is a measure of uncertainty. In this Letter, we connect these two notions of entropy, using an axiomatic framework for thermodynamics [Lieb, Yngvason, Proc. Roy. Soc.(2013)]. In particular, we obtain a direct relation between the Clausius entropy and the Shannon entropy, or its generalisation to quantum systems, the von Neumann entropy. More generally, we find that entropy measures relevant in non-equilibrium thermodynamics correspond to entropies used in one-shot information theory."

For this scheme, we establish contextuality and Wigner function negativity as computational resources, extending results of [M. Howard et al., Nature 510, 351--355 (2014)] to two-level systems. For this purpose, we define a Wigner function suited to systems of $n$ rebits, and prove a corresponding discrete Hudson's theorem. We introduce contextuality witnesses for rebit states, and discuss the compatibility of our result with state-independent contextuality."

These processes can perform quantum computations, but it is challenging to design graphs with desired scattering behavior. In this paper, we study and construct momentum switches, graphs that route particles depending on their momenta. We also give an example where there is no exact momentum switch, although we construct an arbitrarily good approximation."
426,1406.3898,2014,1,29,24,Connecting global and local energy distributions in quantum spin models on a lattice,Itai Arad;Tomotaka Kuwahara;Zeph Landau,"Generally, the local interactions in a many-body quantum spin system on a lattice do not commute with each other. Consequently, the Hamiltonian of a local region will generally not commute with that of the entire system, and so the two cannot be measured simultaneously. The connection between the probability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global Hamiltonians will depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these two Hamiltonians. In this paper we characterize the relation between these two distributions. On one hand, we upperbound the probability of measuring an energy $\tau$ in a local region, if the global system is in a superposition of eigenstates with energies $\epsilon<\tau$. On the other hand, we bound the probability of measuring a global energy $\epsilon$ in a bipartite system that is in a tensor product of eigenstates of its two subsystems. Very roughly, we show that due to the local nature of the governing interactions, these distributions are identical to what one encounters in the commuting case, up to some exponentially small corrections. Finally, we use these bounds to study the spectrum of a locally truncated Hamiltonian, in which the energies of a contiguous region have been truncated above some threshold energy $\tau$. We show that the lower part of the spectrum of this Hamiltonian is exponentially close to that of the original Hamiltonian. A restricted version of this result in 1D was a central building block in a recent improvement of the 1D area-law."
427,1406.2973,2014,9,19,24,Approximating Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians efficiently with PEPS,András Molnár;Norbert Schuch;Frank Verstraete;J Ignacio Cirac,"We analyze the error of approximating Gibbs states of local quantum spin Hamiltonians on lattices with Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) as a function of the bond dimension ($D$), temperature ($\beta^{-1}$), and system size ($N$). First, we introduce a compression method in which the bond dimension scales as $D=e^{O(\log^2(N/\epsilon))}$ if $\beta<O(\log (N))$. Second, building on the work of Hastings [Phys. Rev. B 73, 085115 (2006)], we derive a polynomial scaling relation, $D=\left(N/\epsilon\right)^{O(\beta)}$. This implies that the manifold of PEPS forms an efficient representation of Gibbs states of local quantum Hamiltonians. From those bounds it also follows that ground states can be approximated with $D=N^{O(\log(N))}$ whenever the density of states only grows polynomially in the system size. All results hold for any spatial dimension of the lattice."

Like its predecessor arXiv:quant-ph/0105039, ""Notes on a Paulian Idea,"" it is a collection of letters written to various friends and colleagues, most of whom regularly circuit this archive. The unifying theme of all the letters is that each has something to do with the quantum. Particularly, the collection chronicles the emergence of Quantum Bayesianism as a robust view of quantum theory, eventually evolving into the still-more-radical ""QBism"" (with the B standing for no particular designation anymore), as it took its most distinctive turn away from various Copenhagen Interpretations. Included are many anecdotes from the history of quantum information theory: for instance, the story of the origin of the terms ""qubit"" and ""quantum information"" from their originator's own mouth, a copy of a rejection letter written by E. T. Jaynes for one of Rolf Landauer's original erasure-cost principle papers, and much more. Specialized indices are devoted to historical, technical, and philosophical matters. More roundly, the document is an attempt to provide an essential ingredient, unavailable anywhere else, for turning QBism into a live option within the vast spectrum of quantum foundational thought."
429,1403.6102,2014,6,17,24,Renyi generalizations of the conditional quantum mutual information,Mario Berta;Kaushik P Seshadreesan;Mark M Wilde,"The conditional quantum mutual information $I(A;B|C)$ of a tripartite state $\rho_{ABC}$ is an information quantity which lies at the center of many problems in quantum information theory. Three of its main properties are that it is non-negative for any tripartite state, that it decreases under local operations applied to systems $A$ and $B$, and that it obeys the duality relation $I(A;B|C)=I(A;B|D)$ for a four-party pure state on systems $ABCD$. The conditional mutual information also underlies the squashed entanglement, an entanglement measure that satisfies all of the axioms desired for an entanglement measure. As such, it has been an open question to find Rényi generalizations of the conditional mutual information, that would allow for a deeper understanding of the original quantity and find applications beyond the traditional memoryless setting of quantum information theory. The present paper addresses this question, by defining different $\alpha$-Rényi generalizations $I_{\alpha}(A;B|C)$ of the conditional mutual information, some of which we can prove converge to the conditional mutual information in the limit $\alpha\rightarrow1$. Furthermore, we prove that many of these generalizations satisfy non-negativity, duality, and monotonicity with respect to local operations on one of the systems $A$ or $B$ (with it being left as an open question to prove that monotoniticity holds with respect to local operations on both systems). The quantities defined here should find applications in quantum information theory and perhaps even in other areas of physics, but we leave this for future work. We also state a conjecture regarding the monotonicity of the Rényi conditional mutual informations defined here with respect to the Rényi parameter $\alpha$. We prove that this conjecture is true in some special cases and when $\alpha$ is in a neighborhood of one."
430,1402.4145,2014,6,12,24,Unbounded entanglement in nonlocal games,Laura Mančinska;Thomas Vidick,"Quantum entanglement is known to provide a strong advantage in many two-party distributed tasks. We investigate the question of how much entanglement is needed to reach optimal performance. For the first time we show that there exists a purely classical scenario for which no finite amount of entanglement suffices. To this end we introduce a simple two-party nonlocal game $H$, inspired by Lucien Hardy's paradox. In our game each player has only two possible questions and can provide bit strings of any finite length as answer. We exhibit a sequence of strategies which use entangled states in increasing dimension $d$ and succeed with probability $1-O(d^{-c})$ for some $c\geq 0.13$. On the other hand, we show that any strategy using an entangled state of local dimension $d$ has success probability at most $1-\Omega(d^{-2})$. In addition, we show that any strategy restricted to producing answers in a set of cardinality at most $d$ has success probability at most $1-\Omega(d^{-2})$. Finally, we generalize our construction to derive similar results starting from any game $G$ with two questions per player and finite answers sets in which quantum strategies have an advantage."
431,1312.1695,2013,5,13,24,Gate count estimates for performing quantum chemistry on small quantum computers,Dave Wecker;Bela Bauer;Bryan K Clark;Matthew B Hastings;Matthias Troyer,"As quantum computing technology improves and quantum computers with a small but non-trivial number of N > 100 qubits appear feasible in the near future the question of possible applications of small quantum computers gains importance. One frequently mentioned application is Feynman's original proposal of simulating quantum systems, and in particular the electronic structure of molecules and materials. In this paper, we analyze the computational requirements for one of the standard algorithms to perform quantum chemistry on a quantum computer. We focus on the quantum resources required to find the ground state of a molecule twice as large as what current classical computers can solve exactly. We find that while such a problem requires about a ten-fold increase in the number of qubits over current technology, the required increase in the number of gates that can be coherently executed is many orders of magnitude larger. This suggests that for quantum computation to become useful for quantum chemistry problems, drastic algorithmic improvements will be needed."
432,1310.3188,2013,3,25,24,Renormalisation as an inference problem,Cédric Bény;Tobias J Osborne,"In physics we attempt to infer the rules governing a system given only the results of imprecise measurements. This is an ill-posed problem because certain features of the system's state cannot be resolved by the measurements. However, by ignoring the irrelevant features, an effective theory can be made for the remaining observable relevant features. We explain how these relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom can be concretely characterised using quantum distinguishability metrics, thus solving the ill-posed inference problem. This framework then allows us to provide an information-theoretic formulation of the renormalisation group, applicable to both statistical physics and quantum field theory. Using this formulation we show that, given a natural model for an experimentalist's spatial and field-strength measurement uncertainties, the n-point correlation functions of bounded momenta emerge as relevant observables. Our methods also provide a way to extend renormalisation techniques to effective models which are not based on the usual quantum field formalism. In particular, we can explain in elementary terms, using the example of a simple classical system, some of the problems occurring in quantum field theory and their solution."
433,1308.5788,2013,2,19,24,Quantum interactive proofs and the complexity of separability testing,Gus Gutoski;Patrick Hayden;Kevin Milner;Mark M Wilde,"We identify a formal connection between physical problems related to the detection of separable (unentangled) quantum states and complexity classes in theoretical computer science. In particular, we show that to nearly every quantum interactive proof complexity class (including BQP, QMA, QMA(2), and QSZK), there corresponds a natural separability testing problem that is complete for that class. Of particular interest is the fact that the problem of determining whether an isometry can be made to produce a separable state is either QMA-complete or QMA(2)-complete, depending upon whether the distance between quantum states is measured by the one-way LOCC norm or the trace norm. We obtain strong hardness results by proving that for each n-qubit maximally entangled state there exists a fixed one-way LOCC measurement that distinguishes it from any separable state with error probability that decays exponentially in n."

This is an exponential improvement over existing methods for Hamiltonian simulation. In addition, its scaling with respect to time is close to linear, and its scaling with respect to the time derivative of the Hamiltonian is logarithmic. These scalings improve upon most existing methods. Our method is to use a compressed Lie-Trotter formula, based on recent ideas for efficient discrete-time simulations of continuous-time quantum query algorithms."

Adiabatic quantum computation and other ``hands-off"" approaches relieve the need for rapid, precise pulsing to control the system, inspiring at least one high-profile effort to realize a hands-off quantum computing device. But is hands-off incompatible with fault-tolerant? Concerted effort and many innovative ideas have not resolved this question but have instead deepened it, linking it to fundamental problems in quantum complexity theory. Here we present a hands-off approach that is provably (a) capable of scalable universal quantum computation in a non-degenerate ground state and (b) fault-tolerant against an analogue of the usual local stochastic fault model. A satisfying physical and numerical argument indicates that (c) it is also fault-tolerant against thermal excitation below a threshold temperature independent of the computation size."

Here we study transfer matrices of quantum states in a topological phase using the tensor network formalism. We demonstrate that topological quantum order requires a particular type of `symmetry breaking' for the fixed point subspace of the transfer matrix, and relate physical anyon excitations to domain wall excitations at the level of the transfer matrix. A topological phase transition to a trivial phase triggers a change in the fixed point subspace to either a larger or smaller symmetry and we explain how this relates to a condensation or confinement of the corresponding anyon sectors. The tensor network formalism enables us to determine the structure of the topological sectors in two-dimensional gapped phases very efficiently, therefore opening novel avenues for studying fundamental open questions related to anyon condensation."

We give a quantum algorithm for simulating the evolution of an n-qubit system for time t within precision epsilon. If the Lindbladian consists of poly(n) operators that can each be expressed as a linear combination of poly(n) tensor products of Pauli operators then the gate cost of our algorithm is O(t polylog(t/epsilon) poly(n)). We also show that this efficiency cannot be obtained via a trivial reduction of Lindblad evolution to Hamiltonian evolution in a larger system. Instead, the approach of our algorithm is to use a novel variation of the ""linear combinations of unitaries"" construction that pertains to channels."
438,1611.08802,2016,4,1,23,Relative entropies and their use in quantum information theory,Felix Leditzky,"This dissertation investigates relative entropies, also called generalized divergences, and how they can be used to characterize information-theoretic tasks in quantum information theory. The main goal is to further refine characterizations of the optimal rates for quantum source coding, state redistribution, and measurement compression with quantum side information via second order asymptotic expansions and strong converse theorems. The dissertation consists of a mathematical and an information-theoretic part. In the mathematical part, we focus on the $\alpha$-sandwiched Rényi divergence ($\alpha$-SRD). We first investigate the limit $\alpha\to 0$ to determine whether this recovers the well-known $0$-Rényi relative divergence. We then prove various new results for entropic quantities derived from the $\alpha$-SRD, including dimension bounds and useful bounds in terms of the fidelity between two quantum states. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality (viz. monotonicity under quantum operations) for the $\alpha$-SRD, and give applications to entropic bounds. In the information-theoretic part, we first derive the second order asymptotics of visible quantum source coding using a mixed source. For the achievability part, we develop universal quantum source codes achieving a given second order rate for a memoryless source. As a corollary of the main result, we obtain the second order asymptotics of quantum source coding using a single memoryless source. We then prove strong converse theorems for state redistribution (with or without feedback) and measurement compression with quantum side information. The key ingredients in proving these theorems are the aforementioned fidelity bounds on Rényi entropic quantities derived from the $\alpha$-SRD."

The growing field of high-dimensional expanders in recent years has had increasing interaction with quantum theory and presents a possibility of providing an affirmative resolution of the quantum LDPC conjecture. Indeed, existence of high-dimensional expanders of bounded degree and large systole and co-systole would translate into quantum codes with low-weight parity checks and large distance. Alas, we show that trying to leverage the mere ""random-like"" appearance of such high-dimensional expanders to find good quantum codes may be futile: $d$-complexes that are $\epsilon$-far from perfectly random, with $\epsilon < 1$, have a systole with small Hamming weight. In particular, if the complex has $n$ vertices, we bound the size of its systole by $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{1/(2d)}) n$. Quantum codes aside, our work places a first upper-bound on the systole of high-dimensional expanders with small discrepancy, and specifically Ramanujan complexes."
440,1610.05238,2016,11,16,23,Shortcuts to quantum network routing,Eddie Schoute;Laura Mančinska;Tanvirul Islam;Iordanis Kerenidis;Stephanie Wehner,"A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once. Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a model of entanglement generation."
441,1609.08172,2016,10,26,23,The Clifford group fails gracefully to be a unitary 4-design,Huangjun Zhu;Richard Kueng;Markus Grassl;David Gross,"A unitary t-design is a set of unitaries that is ""evenly distributed"" in the sense that the average of any t-th order polynomial over the design equals the average over the entire unitary group. In various fields -- e.g. quantum information theory -- one frequently encounters constructions that rely on matrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices to sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This results in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent unitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford group. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a 4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which the Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design. Our results show that for various applications in quantum information theory and in the theory of convex signal recovery, Clifford orbits perform almost as well as those of true 4-designs. Technically, it turns out that in a precise sense, the 4th tensor power of the Clifford group affords only one more invariant subspace than the 4th tensor power of the unitary group. That additional subspace is a stabilizer code -- a structure extensively studied in the field of quantum error correction codes. The action of the Clifford group on this stabilizer code can be decomposed explicitly into previously known irreps of the discrete symplectic group. We give various constructions of exact complex projective 4-designs or approximate 4-designs of arbitrarily high precision from Clifford orbits. Building on results from coding theory, we give strong evidence suggesting that these orbits actually constitute complex projective 5-designs."

As the number of quantum components grows, it becomes imperative to consider the energetic expense of such elementary operations. Here we determine the fundamental energy requirements for physical implementations of any general quantum measurement. We show that the exact costs for projective measurements depend on the outcome probabilities only, causing more severe constraints on error correction and control protocols than previously known. In contrast, energy can be extracted from certain measurement processes even if their outcome is recorded. Our results constitute fundamental physical limitations against which to benchmark implementations of future quantum devices as they grow in complexity."

Among its strengths are the plethora of known ways in which fault-tolerant Clifford operations can be performed, namely, by deforming the topology of the surface, by the fusion and splitting of codes and even by braiding engineered Majorana modes using twist defects. Here we present a unified framework to describe these methods, which is required to better compare different schemes, and to facilitate the design of hybrid schemes. Novel to our unification is the identification of twist defects with the corners of the planar code. This identification enables us to find new ways of performing single-qubit Clifford gates by exchanging the corners of the planar code via code deformation. We analyse the ways in which all of the different schemes can be combined, and propose a novel hybrid encoding. We also show how all of the Clifford gates can be implemented on a single code without loss of distance, thus offering an attractive alternative to ancilla-mediated schemes to complete the Clifford group with lattice surgery."

We consider the problem of identifying a shifted version of the characteristic function of a (known) difference set. We present a generic quantum algorithm that can be used to tackle any hidden shift problem for any difference set in any abelian group. We discuss special cases of this framework where the resulting quantum algorithm is efficient. This includes: a) Paley difference sets based on quadratic residues in finite fields, which allows to recover the shifted Legendre function quantum algorithm, b) Hadamard difference sets, which allows to recover the shifted bent function quantum algorithm, and c) Singer difference sets based on finite geometries. The latter class allows us to define instances of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem that can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer."

We show that in a fairly general setting, a simple extension of a nonlocal game can certify instead the absence of quantum nonlocality. Through contraposition, our result implies that a super-classical performance for such a game ensures that a player's output is unpredictable to the other player. Previously such output unpredictability was known with respect to a third party."
447,1607.01302,2016,9,8,23,A Resource Theory for Work and Heat,Carlo Sparaciari;Jonathan Oppenheim;Tobias Fritz,"Several recent results in the field of quantum thermodynamics have been obtained using the tools of quantum information theory and resource theories. So far, the resource theories utilised to describe quantum thermodynamics have assumed the existence of an infinite thermal reservoir, by declaring that thermal states at some background temperature come for free. Here, we propose a resource theory of quantum thermodynamics without a background temperature, so that no states at all come for free. We apply this resource theory to the case of many non-interacting systems, and show that states are classified by their entropy and average energy. This implies that thermodynamics can be described in a two-dimensional convex set that we call the energy-entropy diagram. The answers to many resource-theoretic questions about thermodynamics can be read off from this diagram, such as the efficiency of a heat engine consisting of finite reservoirs or the rate of conversion between two states. This allows us to consider a resource theory which puts work and heat on an equal footing, and serves as a model for more general resource theories."
448,1606.08028,2016,8,29,23,Squashed entanglement and approximate private states,Mark M Wilde,"The squashed entanglement is a fundamental entanglement measure in quantum information theory, finding application as an upper bound on the distillable secret key or distillable entanglement of a quantum state or a quantum channel. This paper simplifies proofs that the squashed entanglement is an upper bound on distillable key for finite-dimensional quantum systems and solidifies such proofs for infinite-dimensional quantum systems. More specifically, this paper establishes that the logarithm of the dimension of the key system (call it $\log_{2}K$) in an $\varepsilon$-approximate private state is bounded from above by the squashed entanglement of that state plus a term that depends only $\varepsilon$ and $\log_{2}K$. Importantly, the extra term does not depend on the dimension of the shield systems of the private state. The result holds for the bipartite squashed entanglement, and an extension of this result is established for two different flavors of the multipartite squashed entanglement."
449,1605.07197,2016,8,9,23,Quantum computation with realistic magic state factories,Joe O'Gorman;Earl T Campbell,"Leading approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation dedicate a significant portion of the hardware to computational factories that churn out high-fidelity ancillas called magic states. Consequently, efficient and realistic factory design is of paramount importance. Here we present the most detailed resource assessment to date of magic state factories within a surface code quantum computer, along the way introducing a number of new techniques. We show that the block codes of Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. A 86, 052329 (2012)] have been systematically undervalued; we track correlated errors both numerically and analytically, providing fidelity estimates without appeal to the union bound. We also introduce a subsystem code realisation of these protocols with constant time and low ancilla cost. Additionally, we confirm that magic state factories have space-time costs that scale as a constant factor of surface code costs. We find that the magic state factory required for post-classical factoring can be as small as 6.3 million data qubits, ignoring ancilla qubits, assuming $10^{-4}$ error gates, and the availability of long range interactions."

Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation with completeness $c$ and soundness $s$, either with or without a witness (corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into a new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method known requires extra workspace of ${O \bigl( p \log \frac{1}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like logarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper presents error-reduction methods for unitary quantum computations (i.e., computations without intermediate measurements) that require extra workspace of just ${O \bigl( \log \frac{p}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This in particular gives the first methods of strong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with two-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in complexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in bounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper bound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong amplification for matchgate computations."
451,1604.04340,2016,6,28,23,A parallel repetition theorem for all entangled games,Henry Yuen,"The behavior of games repeated in parallel, when played with quantumly entangled players, has received much attention in recent years. Quantum analogues of Raz's classical parallel repetition theorem have been proved for many special classes of games. However, for general entangled games no parallel repetition theorem was known. We prove that the entangled value of a two-player game $G$ repeated $n$ times in parallel is at most $c_G n^{-1/4} \log n$ for a constant $c_G$ depending on $G$, provided that the entangled value of $G$ is less than 1. In particular, this gives the first proof that the entangled value of a parallel repeated game must converge to 0 for all games whose entangled value is less than 1. Central to our proof is a combination of both classical and quantum correlated sampling."

Our cost model assumes that the attack is run on a surface code based fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our estimates rely on a time-area metric that costs the number of logical qubits times the depth of the circuit in units of surface code cycles. As a surface code cycle involves a significant classical processing stage, our cost estimates allow for crude, but direct, comparisons of classical and quantum algorithms. We exhibit a circuit for a pre-image attack on SHA-256 that is approximately $2^{153.8}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately $2^{12.6}$ logical qubits. This yields an overall cost of $2^{166.4}$ logical-qubit-cycles. Likewise we exhibit a SHA3-256 circuit that is approximately $2^{146.5}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately $2^{20}$ logical qubits for a total cost of, again, $2^{166.5}$ logical-qubit-cycles. Both attacks require on the order of $2^{128}$ queries in a quantum black-box model, hence our results suggest that executing these attacks may be as much as $275$ billion times more expensive than one would expect from the simple query analysis."

In this setting, sender and receiver do not know the specific channel that will be used for communication, but only know the set that the channel is selected from. We investigate different variations of the problem: uninformed users, informed receiver, informed sender, and feedback assistance. We derive single-letter formulas for all corresponding channel capacities. Our proofs are based on one-shot decoupling bounds and properties of smooth entropies."

Most research in this area has focused either on the information-theoretic advantages of quantum protocols or on the security of classical cryptographic schemes against quantum attacks. In this work, we initiate the study of another relevant topic: the encryption of quantum data in the computational setting. In this direction, we establish quantum versions of several fundamental classical results. First, we develop natural definitions for private-key and public-key encryption schemes for quantum data. We then define notions of semantic security and indistinguishability, and, in analogy with the classical work of Goldwasser and Micali, show that these notions are equivalent. Finally, we construct secure quantum encryption schemes from basic primitives. In particular, we show that quantum-secure one-way functions imply IND-CCA1-secure symmetric-key quantum encryption, and that quantum-secure trapdoor one-way permutations imply semantically-secure public-key quantum encryption."
455,1602.00703,2016,4,1,23,Direct certification of a class of quantum simulations,D Hangleiter;Martin Kliesch;Martin Schwarz;Jens Eisert,"One of the main challenges in the field of quantum simulation and computation is to identify ways to certify the correct functioning of a device when a classical efficient simulation is not available. In such a situation one cannot simply classically keep track of the dynamics of the device. In this note, we discuss weak-membership notions of the certification for ground state preparations of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on simple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. These considerations have applications to classically intractable analog quantum simulations: for example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can realise universal quantum computers. Our certification approach is non-interactive and thus avoids challenges arising from interactive proof systems. Moreover, our certification protocol is applicable to recent results on so-called IQP circuits aiming at the demonstration of quantum supremacy."
456,1601.03843,2016,3,9,23,Uncertainty relations for general phase spaces,Reinhard F Werner,"We describe a setup for obtaining uncertainty relations for arbitrary pairs of observables related by Fourier transform. The physical examples discussed here are standard position and momentum, number and angle, finite qudit systems, and strings of qubits for quantum information applications. The uncertainty relations allow an arbitrary choice of metric for the distance of outcomes, and the choice of an exponent distinguishing e.g., absolute or root mean square deviations. The emphasis of the article is on developing a unified treatment, in which one observable takes values in an arbitrary locally compact abelian group and the other in the dual group. In all cases the phase space symmetry implies the equality of measurement uncertainty bounds and preparation uncertainty bounds, and there is a straightforward method for determining the optimal bounds."
457,1512.03145,2015,2,4,23,Can small quantum systems learn?,Nathan Wiebe;Christopher E Granade,"We examine the question of whether quantum mechanics places limitations on the ability of small quantum devices to learn. We specifically examine the question in the context of Bayesian inference, wherein the prior and posterior distributions are encoded in the quantum state vector. We conclude based on lower bounds from Grover's search that an efficient blackbox method for updating the distribution is impossible. We then address this by providing a new adaptive form of approximate quantum Bayesian inference that is polynomially faster than its classical analogue and tractable if the quantum system is augmented with classical memory or if the low-order moments of the distribution are protected using a repetition code. This work suggests that there may be a connection between fault tolerance and the capacity of a quantum system to learn from its surroundings."
458,1511.05161,2015,2,3,23,A geometric protocol for a robust Majorana magic gate,Torsten Karzig;Yuval Oreg;Gil Refael;Michael H Freedman,"A universal quantum computer requires a full set of basic quantum gates. With Majorana bound states one can form all necessary quantum gates in a topologically protected way, bar one. In this manuscript we present a protocol that achieves the missing, so called, $\pi/8$ 'magic' phase gate. The protocol is based on the manipulation of geometric phases in a universal manner, and does not require fine tuning for distinct physical realizations. The protocol converges exponentially with the number of steps in the geometric path. Furthermore, the magic gate protocol relies on the most basic hardware previously suggested for topologically protected gates, and can be extended to any-phase-gate, where $\pi/8$ is substituted by any $\alpha$."

For example the class of functions computable with classical physics actually exactly coincides with the class computable quantum-mechanically. It is strongly believed, but not proven, that quantum computing provides exponential speed-up for a range of problems, such as factoring. Here we address a computational scenario of ""randomness processing"" in which quantum theory provably yields, not only resource reduction over classical stochastic physics, but a strictly larger class of problems which can be solved. Beyond new foundational insights into the nature and malleability of randomness, and the distinction between quantum and classical information, these results also offer the potential of developing classically intractable simulations with currently accessible quantum technologies."

This was long recognized by the visionary Richard Feynman who pointed out in the 1980s that quantum mechanical problems were better solved with quantum machines. It was only in 1994 that Peter Shor came up with an algorithm that is able to calculate the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than known possible with a classical computer. This paradigmatic algorithm stimulated the flourishing research in quantum information processing and the quest for an actual implementation of a quantum computer. Over the last fifteen years, using skillful optimizations, several instances of a Shor algorithm have been implemented on various platforms and clearly proved the feasibility of quantum factoring. For general scalability, though, a different approach has to be pursued. Here, we report the realization of a fully scalable Shor algorithm as proposed by Kitaev. For this, we demonstrate factoring the number fifteen by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four ""cache-qubits"", together with the implementation of generalized arithmetic operations, known as modular multipliers. The scalable algorithm has been realized with an ion-trap quantum computer exhibiting success probabilities in excess of 90%."

Rev. Lett. 115, 020501] for the characterization of the statistical correlations arising from finite dimensional quantum systems. First, we introduce the dimension-constrained noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) paradigm, where a number of polynomial inequalities are defined and optimization is conducted over all feasible operator representations of bounded dimensionality. Important problems in device independent and semi-device independent quantum information science can be formulated (or almost formulated) in this framework. We present effective SDP hierarchies to attack the general dimension-constrained NPO problem (and related ones) and prove their asymptotic convergence. To illustrate the power of these relaxations, we use them to derive new dimension witnesses for temporal and Bell-type correlation scenarios, and also to bound the probability of success of quantum random access codes."
463,1507.06334,2015,9,22,23,Optimal state discrimination and unstructured search in nonlinear quantum mechanics,Andrew M Childs;Joshua Young,"Nonlinear variants of quantum mechanics can solve tasks that are impossible in standard quantum theory, such as perfectly distinguishing nonorthogonal states. Here we derive the optimal protocol for distinguishing two states of a qubit using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a model of nonlinear quantum mechanics that arises as an effective description of Bose-Einstein condensates. Using this protocol, we present an algorithm for unstructured search in the Gross-Pitaevskii model, obtaining an exponential improvement over a previous algorithm of Meyer and Wong. This result establishes a limitation on the effectiveness of the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. More generally, we demonstrate similar behavior under a family of related nonlinearities, giving evidence that the ability to quickly discriminate nonorthogonal states and thereby solve unstructured search is a generic feature of nonlinear quantum mechanics."
464,1504.05376,2015,8,3,23,A Minimax Converse for Quantum Channel Coding,Joseph M Renes,"We prove a one-shot ""minimax"" converse bound for quantum channel coding assisted by positive partial transpose channels between sender and receiver. The bound is similar in spirit to the converse by Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verdu [IEEE Trans. Info. Theory 56, 2307-2359 (2010)] for classical channel coding, and also enjoys the saddle point property enabling the order of optimizations to be interchanged. Equivalently, the bound can be formulated as a semidefinite program satisfying strong duality. The convex nature of the bound implies channel symmetries can substantially simplify the optimization, enabling us to explicitly compute the finite blocklength behavior for several simple qubit channels. In particular, we find that finite blocklength converse statements for the classical erasure channel apply to the assisted quantum erasure channel, while bounds for the classical binary symmetric channel apply to both the assisted dephasing and depolarizing channels. This implies that these qubit channels inherit statements regarding the asymptotic limit of large blocklength, such as the strong converse or second-order converse rates, from their classical counterparts. Moreover, for the dephasing channel, the finite blocklength bounds are as tight as those for the classical binary symmetric channel, since coding for classical phase errors yields equivalently-performing unassisted quantum codes."
465,1503.02269,2015,7,28,23,Local Hamiltonians with Approximation-Robust Entanglement,Lior Eldar,"Quantum entanglement is considered, by and large, to be a very delicate and non-robust phenomenon that is very hard to maintain in the presence of noise, or non-zero temperatures. In recent years however, and motivated, in part, by a quest for a quantum analog of the PCP theorem researches have tried to establish whether or not we can preserve quantum entanglement at ""constant"" temperatures that are independent of system size. This would imply that any quantum state with energy at most, say 0.05 of the total available energy of the Hamiltonian, would be highly-entangled. To this date, no such systems were found, and moreover, it became evident that even embedding local Hamiltonians on robust, albeit ""non-physical"" topologies, namely expanders, does not guarantee entanglement robustness. In this study, we indicate that such robustness may be possible after all: We construct an infinite family of O(1)-local Hamiltonians, corresponding to check terms of a quantum error-correcting code with the following property of inapproximability: any quantum state with energy at most 0.05 w.r.t. the total available energy cannot be even approximately simulated by classical circuits of bounded (sub-logarithmic) depth. In a sense, this implies that even providing a ""witness"" to the fact that the local Hamiltonian can be ""almost"" satisfied, already requires some measure of long-range entanglement. Our construction is but a first step in what, we believe, is a whole range of possible entanglement - robust local Hamiltonians. A natural next step, we believe, is to devise such local Hamiltonians that resist approximation in terms of bounded-depth quantum circuits (e.g. NLTS), and even find such robust forms of entanglement that are useful for some computation."

Most notably, unitary 2-designs are known to achieve decoupling, a fundamental primitive of paramount importance in quantum Shannon theory. Here we prove that unitary 2-designs can be implemented approximately using random diagonal-unitaries."

Quantum computers are suggested as one route to propagating quantum systems far more efficiently than ordinary numerical methods. In the past few years, researchers have actively been improving quantum simulation algorithms, especially those in second quantization. This work continues to advance the state-of-the-art by unifying several diverging approaches under a common framework. In particular, it highlights the similarities and differences of the first and second quantized algorithms which are usually presented in a distinct fashion. By combining aspects of the two approaches, this work moves towards an online second quantized algorithm operating within a single-Fock space. This paper also unifies a host of approaches to algorithmic quantum measurement by removing superficial differences. The aim of the effort is not only to give a high-level understanding of quantum simulation, but to move towards experimentally realizable algorithms with practical applications in chemistry and beyond."

Our method can simulate the time evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. As in another recent algorithm, the cost of our method depends only logarithmically on the inverse of the desired precision, which is optimal. However, we simplify the algorithm and its analysis by using a method for implementing linear combinations of unitary operations to directly apply the truncated Taylor series."
469,1412.1907,2014,2,27,23,Contagious error sources would need time travel to prevent quantum computation,Gil Kalai;Greg Kuperberg,"We consider an error model for quantum computing that consists of ""contagious quantum germs"" that can infect every output qubit when at least one input qubit is infected. Once a germ actively causes error, it continues to cause error indefinitely for every qubit it infects, with arbitrary quantum entanglement and correlation. Although this error model looks much worse than quasi-independent error, we show that it reduces to quasi-independent error with the technique of quantum teleportation. The construction, which was previously described by Knill, is that every quantum circuit can be converted to a mixed circuit with bounded quantum depth. We also consider the restriction of bounded quantum depth from the point of view of quantum complexity classes."
470,1410.5487,2014,2,13,23,Quantum error suppression with commuting Hamiltonians: Two-local is too local,Iman Marvian;Daniel A Lidar,"We consider error suppression schemes in which quantum information is encoded into the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian comprising a sum of commuting terms. Since such Hamiltonians are gapped they are considered natural candidates for protection of quantum information and topological or adiabatic quantum computation. However, we prove that they cannot be used to this end in the 2-local case. By making the favorable assumption that the gap is infinite we show that single-site perturbations can generate a degeneracy splitting in the ground subspace of this type of Hamiltonians which is of the same order as the magnitude of the perturbation, and is independent of the number of interacting sites and their Hilbert space dimensions, just as in the absence of the protecting Hamiltonian. This splitting results in decoherence of the ground subspace, and we demonstrate that for natural noise models the coherence time is proportional to the inverse of the degeneracy splitting. Our proof involves a new version of the no-hiding theorem which shows that quantum information cannot be approximately hidden in the correlations between two quantum systems, and should be of independent interest. The main reason that 2-local commuting Hamiltonians cannot be used for quantum error suppression is that their ground subspaces have only short-range (two-body) entanglement."

We show that individual physical gates on the underlying qubits that compose the code are restricted to have entries of the form $e^{i \pi c/2^k}$ along their diagonal, resulting in a similarly restricted class of logical gates that can be implemented in this manner. Moreover, we show that all diagonal logical gates that can be implemented transversally by individual physical diagonal gates must belong to the Clifford hierarchy. Furthermore, we can use this result to prove a conjecture about transversal gates made by Zeng et al. in 2007."

If the model of the system is sensitive to noise from the environment, or small perturbations to the original interactions, it will not properly model the robustness of the real physical system it aims to describe, or be useful when engineering novel systems for quantum information processing. We show that local observables and correlation functions of local Liouvillians are stable to local perturbations if the dynamics is rapidly mixing and has a unique fixed point. No other condition is required."
473,1409.5041,2014,10,22,23,Quasi-quantization: classical statistical theories with an epistemic restriction,Robert W Spekkens,"A significant part of quantum theory can be obtained from a single innovation relative to classical theories, namely, that there is a fundamental restriction on the sorts of statistical distributions over physical states that can be prepared. This is termed an ""epistemic restriction"" because it implies a fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge that any observer can have about the physical state of a classical system. This article provides an overview of epistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical theory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and discrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction called classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all known epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic structure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to an arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a kind of quasi-quantization scheme; ""quasi"" because it generally only yields a theory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and measurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and because in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is a distortion of such a subset. Finally, we propose to classify quantum phenomena as weakly or strongly nonclassical by whether or not they can arise in an epistricted theory."

In this article, we show that general quantum computations can be encoded into the physics of wave packets propagating through a planar graph, with scattering interactions governed by the fermionic Hubbard model. Therefore, simulating the model on planar graphs is as hard as simulating quantum computation. We give two different arguments, demonstrating that the simulation is difficult both for wave packets prepared as excitations of the fermionic vacuum, and for hole wave packets at filling fraction one-half in the limit of strong coupling. In the latter case, which is described by the t-J model, there is only reflection and no transmission in the scattering events, as would be the case for classical hard spheres. In that sense, the construction provides a quantum mechanical analog of the Fredkin-Toffoli billiard ball computer."
475,1409.3426,2014,9,30,23,No-Signalling Assisted Zero-Error Capacity of Quantum Channels and an Information Theoretic Interpretation of the Lovasz Number,Runyao Duan;Andreas Winter,"We study the one-shot zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel assisted by quantum no-signalling correlations, and the reverse problem of exact simulation of a prescribed channel by a noiseless classical one. Quantum no-signalling correlations are viewed as two-input and two-output completely positive and trace preserving maps with linear constraints enforcing that the device cannot signal. Both problems lead to simple semidefinite programmes (SDPs) that depend only on the Kraus operator space of the channel. In particular, we show that the zero-error classical simulation cost is precisely the conditional min-entropy of the Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix of the given channel. The zero-error classical capacity is given by a similar-looking but different SDP; the asymptotic zero-error classical capacity is the regularization of this SDP, and in general we do not know of any simple form. Interestingly however, for the class of classical-quantum channels, we show that the asymptotic capacity is given by a much simpler SDP, which coincides with a semidefinite generalization of the fractional packing number suggested earlier by Aram Harrow. This finally results in an operational interpretation of the celebrated Lovasz $\vartheta$ function of a graph as the zero-error classical capacity of the graph assisted by quantum no-signalling correlations, the first information theoretic interpretation of the Lovasz number."

One framework considers Thermal Operations---unitaries which conserve energy. The other framework considers all maps which preserve the Gibbs state at a given temperature. Thermal Operations preserve the Gibbs state; hence a natural question which arises is whether the two frameworks are equivalent. Classically, this is true---Gibbs-Preserving Maps are no more powerful than Thermal Operations. Here, we show that this no longer holds in the quantum regime: a Gibbs-Preserving Map can generate coherent superpositions of energy levels while Thermal Operations cannot. This gap has an impact on clarifying a mathematical framework for quantum thermodynamics."

We demonstrate how smooth computable functions $f$ can be synthesized from two basic primitives. This synthesis approach constitutes a manifestly quantum form of arithmetic that differs greatly from the approaches commonly used in quantum algorithms. The key advantage of our approach is that it requires far fewer qubits than existing approaches: as a case in point, we show that using as few as $3$ ancilla qubits, one can obtain RUS circuits for approximate multiplication and reciprocals. We also analyze the costs of performing multiplication and inversion on a quantum computer using conventional approaches and find that they can require too many qubits to execute on a small quantum computer, unlike our approach."

In this paper, we describe an explicit algorithm for constructing this transformation between a pair of equivalent irreps, assuming we are given an algorithm to compute the matrix elements of these irreps. Along the way, we derive a generalization of the classical orthogonality relations for matrix elements of irreps of finite groups. We give an explicit form of such unitary matrices for the important case of conjugated Young-Yamanouchi representations, when our group $G$ is symmetric group $S(N)$."

In this paper, we prove that the estimates produced by randomized benchmarking (both standard and interleaved) for arbitrary Markovian noise sources are remarkably precise by showing that the variance due to sampling random gate sequences is small. We discuss how to choose experimental parameters, in particular the number and lengths of random sequences, in order to characterize average gate errors with rigorous confidence bounds. We also show that randomized benchmarking can be used to reliably characterize time-dependent Markovian noise (e.g., when noise is due to a magnetic field with fluctuating strength). Moreover, we identify a necessary property for time-dependent noise that is violated by some sources of non-Markovian noise, which provides a test for non-Markovianity."
481,1403.0505,2014,5,12,23,A search for quantum coin-flipping protocols using optimization techniques,Ashwin Nayak;Jamie Sikora;Levent Tunçel,"Coin-flipping is a cryptographic task in which two physically separated, mistrustful parties wish to generate a fair coin-flip by communicating with each other. Chailloux and Kerenidis (2009) designed quantum protocols that guarantee coin-flips with near optimal bias. The probability of any outcome in these protocols is provably at most $1/\sqrt{2} + \delta$ for any given $\delta > 0$. However, no explicit description of these protocols is known, and the number of rounds in the protocols tends to infinity as $\delta$ goes to 0. In fact, the smallest bias achieved by known explicit protocols is $1/4$ (Ambainis, 2001). We take a computational optimization approach, based mostly on convex optimization, to the search for simple and explicit quantum strong coin-flipping protocols. We present a search algorithm to identify protocols with low bias within a natural class, protocols based on bit-commitment (Nayak and Shor, 2003) restricting to commitment states used by Mochon (2005). An analysis of the resulting protocols via semidefinite programs (SDPs) unveils a simple structure. For example, we show that the SDPs reduce to second-order cone programs. We devise novel cheating strategies in the protocol by restricting the semidefinite programs and use the strategies to prune the search. The techniques we develop enable a computational search for protocols given by a mesh over the parameter space. The protocols have up to six rounds of communication, with messages of varying dimension and include the best known explicit protocol (with bias 1/4). We conduct two kinds of search: one for protocols with bias below 0.2499, and one for protocols in the neighbourhood of protocols with bias 1/4. Neither of these searches yields better bias. Based on the mathematical ideas behind the search algorithm, we prove a lower bound on the bias of a class of four-round protocols."
482,1401.7081,2014,4,28,23,Graph-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Correlations,Adán Cabello;Simone Severini;Andreas Winter,"Correlations in Bell and noncontextuality inequalities can be expressed as a positive linear combination of probabilities of events. Exclusive events can be represented as adjacent vertices of a graph, so correlations can be associated to a subgraph. We show that the maximum value of the correlations for classical, quantum, and more general theories is the independence number, the Lovász number, and the fractional packing number of this subgraph, respectively. We also show that, for any graph, there is always a correlation experiment such that the set of quantum probabilities is exactly the Grötschel-Lovász-Schrijver theta body. This identifies these combinatorial notions as fundamental physical objects and provides a method for singling out experiments with quantum correlations on demand."
483,1311.7685,2013,4,25,23,An optimal quantum algorithm for the oracle identification problem,Robin Kothari,"In the oracle identification problem, we are given oracle access to an unknown N-bit string x promised to belong to a known set C of size M and our task is to identify x. We present a quantum algorithm for the problem that is optimal in its dependence on N and M. Our algorithm considerably simplifies and improves the previous best algorithm due to Ambainis et al. Our algorithm also has applications in quantum learning theory, where it improves the complexity of exact learning with membership queries, resolving a conjecture of Hunziker et al. The algorithm is based on ideas from classical learning theory and a new composition theorem for solutions of the filtered $\gamma_2$-norm semidefinite program, which characterizes quantum query complexity. Our composition theorem is quite general and allows us to compose quantum algorithms with input-dependent query complexities without incurring a logarithmic overhead for error reduction. As an application of the composition theorem, we remove all log factors from the best known quantum algorithm for Boolean matrix multiplication."
484,1310.6718,2013,3,4,23,Generation of Universal Linear Optics by Any Beamsplitter,Adam Bouland;Scott Aaronson,"In 1994, Reck et al. showed how to realize any unitary transformation on a single photon using a product of beamsplitters and phaseshifters. Here we show that any single beamsplitter that nontrivially mixes two modes, also densely generates the set of unitary transformations (or orthogonal transformations, in the real case) on the single-photon subspace with m>=3 modes. (We prove the same result for any two-mode real optical gate, and for any two-mode optical gate combined with a generic phaseshifter.) Experimentally, this means that one does not need tunable beamsplitters or phaseshifters for universality: any nontrivial beamsplitter is universal for linear optics. Theoretically, it means that one cannot produce ""intermediate"" models of linear optical computation (analogous to the Clifford group for qubits) by restricting the allowed beamsplitters and phaseshifters: there is a dichotomy; one either gets a trivial set or else a universal set. No similar classification theorem for gates acting on qubits is currently known. We leave open the problem of classifying optical gates that act on three or more modes."
485,1308.4134,2013,1,29,23,An algorithm for the T-count,David Gosset;Vadym Kliuchnikov;Michele Mosca;Vincent Russo,"We consider quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates. In this context the T gate has a special status since it confers universal computation when added to the (classically simulable) Clifford gates. However it can be very expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. We therefore view this gate as a resource which should be used only when necessary. Given an n-qubit unitary U we are interested in computing a circuit that implements it using the minimum possible number of T gates (called the T-count of U). A related task is to decide if the T-count of U is less than or equal to m; we consider this problem as a function of N=2^n and m. We provide a classical algorithm which solves it using time and space both upper bounded as O(N^m poly(m,N)). We implemented our algorithm and used it to show that any Clifford+T circuit for the Toffoli or the Fredkin gate requires at least 7 T gates. This implies that the known 7 T gate circuits for these gates are T-optimal. We also provide a simple expression for the T-count of single-qubit unitaries."

Here we characterize the power of matchgates acting on arbitrary graphs. Specifically, we show that they are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and that they are classically simulable on a cycle. We also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction, a proper subset of matchgates related to some implementations of quantum computing."
487,1306.4352,2013,10,25,23,An improved Landauer Principle with finite-size corrections,David Reeb;Michael M Wolf,"Landauer's Principle relates entropy decrease and heat dissipation during logically irreversible processes. Most theoretical justifications of Landauer's Principle either use thermodynamic reasoning or rely on specific models based on arguable assumptions. Here, we aim at a general and minimal setup to formulate Landauer's Principle in precise terms. We provide a simple and rigorous proof of an improved version of the Principle, which is formulated in terms of an equality rather than an inequality. The proof is based on quantum statistical mechanics concepts rather than on thermodynamic argumentation. From this equality version, we obtain explicit improvements of Landauer's bound that depend on the effective size of the thermal reservoir and reduce to Landauer's bound only for infinite-sized reservoirs."
488,1509.03770,2015,8,20,22,Practical Bayesian Tomography,Christopher E Granade;Joshua Combes;David G Cory,"In recent years, Bayesian methods have been proposed as a solution to a wide range of issues in quantum state and process tomography. State-of-the-art Bayesian tomography solutions suffer from three problems: numerical intractability, a lack of informative prior distributions, and an inability to track time-dependent processes. Here, we address all three problems. First, we use modern statistical methods, as pioneered by Huszár and Houlsby and by Ferrie, to make Bayesian tomography numerically tractable. Our approach allows for practical computation of Bayesian point and region estimators for quantum states and channels. Second, we propose the first priors on quantum states and channels that allow for including useful experimental insight. Finally, we develop a method that allows tracking of time-dependent states and estimates the drift and diffusion processes affecting a state. We provide source code and animated visual examples for our methods."
489,1507.07184,2015,8,8,22,Stable low-rank matrix recovery via null space properties,Maryia Kabanava;Richard Kueng;Holger Rauhut;Ulrich Terstiege,"The problem of recovering a matrix of low rank from an incomplete and possibly noisy set of linear measurements arises in a number of areas. In order to derive rigorous recovery results, the measurement map is usually modeled probabilistically. We derive sufficient conditions on the minimal amount of measurements ensuring recovery via convex optimization. We establish our results via certain properties of the null space of the measurement map. In the setting where the measurements are realized as Frobenius inner products with independent standard Gaussian random matrices we show that $10 r (n_1 + n_2)$ measurements are enough to uniformly and stably recover an $n_1 \times n_2$ matrix of rank at most $r$. We then significantly generalize this result by only requiring independent mean-zero, variance one entries with four finite moments at the cost of replacing $10$ by some universal constant. We also study the case of recovering Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices from measurement matrices proportional to rank-one projectors. For $m \geq C r n$ rank-one projective measurements onto independent standard Gaussian vectors, we show that nuclear norm minimization uniformly and stably reconstructs Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices with high probability. Next, we partially de-randomize this by establishing an analogous statement for projectors onto independent elements of a complex projective 4-designs at the cost of a slightly higher sampling rate $m \geq C rn \log n$. Moreover, if the Hermitian matrix to be recovered is known to be positive semidefinite, then we show that the nuclear norm minimization approach may be replaced by minimizing the $\ell_2$-norm of the residual subject to the positive semidefinite constraint. Then no estimate of the noise level is required a priori. We discuss applications in quantum physics and the phase retrieval problem."
490,1302.5733,2013,6,19,22,Obstructions To Classically Simulating The Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm,Matthew B Hastings;Michael H Freedman,"We consider the adiabatic quantum algorithm for systems with ""no sign problem"", such as the transverse field Ising mode, and analyze the equilibration time for quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) on these systems. We ask: if the spectral gap is only inverse polynomially small, will equilibration methods based on slowly changing the Hamiltonian parameters in the QMC simulation succeed in a polynomial time? We show that this is not true, by constructing counter-examples. Some examples are Hamiltonians where the space of configurations where the wavefunction has non-negligible amplitude has a nontrivial fundamental group, causing the space of trajectories in imaginary time to break into disconnected components, with only negligible probability outside these components. For the simplest example we give with an abelian fundamental group, QMC does not equilibrate but still solves the optimization problem. More severe effects leading to failure to solve the optimization can occur when the fundamental group is a free group on two generators. Other examples where QMC fails have a trivial fundamental group, but still use ideas from topology relating group presentations to simplicial complexes. We define gadgets to realize these Hamiltonians as the effective low-energy dynamics of a transverse field Ising model. We present some analytic results on equilibration times which may be of some independent interest in the theory of equilibration of Markov chains. Conversely, we show that a small spectral gap implies slow equilibration at low temperature for some initial conditions and for a natural choice of local QMC updates."

Coming up with exact quantum algorithms that substantially outperform the best classical algorithm has been a quite challenging task. In this paper, we present two new exact quantum algorithms for natural problems: 1) for the problem EXACT_k^n in which we have to determine whether the sequence of input bits x_1, ..., x_n contains exactly k values x_i=1; 2) for the problem THRESHOLD_k^n in which we have to determine if at least k of n input bits are equal to 1."
492,1612.05080,2016,7,28,22,"$SU(p,q)$ coherent states and a Gaussian de Finetti theorem",Anthony Leverrier,"We prove a generalization of the quantum de Finetti theorem when the local space is not finite-dimensional but rather an infinite-dimensional Fock space. In particular, instead of considering the action of the permutation group on $n$ copies of that space, we consider the action of the unitary group $U(n)$ on the creation operators of the $n$ modes. We define a natural generalization of the symmetric subspace as the space of states invariant under unitaries in $U(n)$. Our main result is a complete characterization of this subspace, which turns out to be spanned by a family of generalized coherent states related to the Lie group $SU(p,q)$. These (Gaussian) coherent states resolve the identity on the subspace, which then implies a Gaussian de Finetti theorem stating that tracing over a few modes of a unitary-invariant state gives a state close to a mixture of Gaussian states."
493,1612.00762,2016,2,26,22,Structured Filtering,Christopher E Granade;Nathan Wiebe,"A major challenge facing existing sequential Monte-Carlo methods for parameter estimation in physics stems from the inability of existing approaches to robustly deal with experiments that have different mechanisms that yield the results with equivalent probability. We address this problem here by proposing a form of particle filtering that clusters the particles that comprise the sequential Monte-Carlo approximation to the posterior before applying a resampler. Through a new graphical approach to thinking about such models, we are able to devise an artificial-intelligence based strategy that automatically learns the shape and number of the clusters in the support of the posterior. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to randomized gap estimation and a form of low circuit-depth phase estimation where existing methods from the physics literature either exhibit much worse performance or even fail completely."

This paper gives an ideosyncratic overview of applications, exact results and computational aspects of diagonalizing transfer matrices and matrix product operators. The results in this paper are a mixture of classic results, presented from the point of view of tensor networks, and of new results. Topics discussed are exact solutions of transfer matrices in equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, tensor network states, matrix product operator algebras, and numerical matrix product state methods for finding extremal eigenvectors of matrix product operators."
495,1611.07995,2016,12,16,22,Factoring using 2n+2 qubits with Toffoli based modular multiplication,Thomas Häner;Martin Roetteler;Krysta M Svore,"We describe an implementation of Shor's quantum algorithm to factor n-bit integers using only 2n+2 qubits. In contrast to previous space-optimized implementations, ours features a purely Toffoli based modular multiplication circuit. The circuit depth and the overall gate count are in O(n^3) and O(n^3 log(n)), respectively. We thus achieve the same space and time costs as Takahashi et al., while using a purely classical modular multiplication circuit. As a consequence, our approach evades most of the cost overheads originating from rotation synthesis and enables testing and localization of faults in both, the logical level circuit and an actual quantum hardware implementation. Our new (in-place) constant-adder, which is used to construct the modular multiplication circuit, uses only dirty ancilla qubits and features a circuit size and depth in O(n log(n)) and O(n), respectively."

So far, there is no universal method to overcome this problem. However, recent years brought a new class of non-perturbative Hamiltonian techniques named tensor networks, where the sign problem is absent. In previous work, we have demonstrated that this approach, in particular matrix product states in 1+1 dimensions, can be used to perform precise calculations in a lattice gauge theory, the massless and massive Schwinger model. We have computed the mass spectrum of this theory, its thermal properties and real-time dynamics. In this work, we review these results and we extend our calculations to the case of two flavours and non-zero chemical potential. We are able to reliably reproduce known analytical results for this model, thus demonstrating that tensor networks can tackle the sign problem of a lattice gauge theory at finite density."

Quantum coherence in many-body systems embodies the essence of entanglement and is an essential ingredient for a plethora of physical phenomena in quantum optics, quantum information, solid state physics, and nanoscale thermodynamics. In recent years, research on the presence and functional role of quantum coherence in biological systems has also attracted a considerable interest. Despite the fundamental importance of quantum coherence, the development of a rigorous theory of quantum coherence as a physical resource has only been initiated recently. In this Colloquium we discuss and review the development of this rapidly growing research field that encompasses the characterization, quantification, manipulation, dynamical evolution, and operational application of quantum coherence."
498,1608.07569,2016,11,28,22,Information-theoretic limitations on approximate quantum cloning and broadcasting,Marius Lemm;Mark M Wilde,"We prove new quantitative limitations on the existence of an approximate simultaneous cloning or broadcasting of mixed states. The results are based on information-theoretic (entropic) considerations and generalize the well known no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems. In the special case when one of the states involved is the maximally mixed state of the symmetric subspace of $n$ qudits, we prove entropy inequalities which show how universal cloning machines and symmetrized partial trace channels are dual to each other. This duality manifests itself both in the algebraic sense of adjointness of quantum channels and in the operational sense that a universal cloning machine can be used as an approximate recovery channel for a symmetrized partial trace channel and vice versa."
499,1607.00932,2016,11,28,22,Optimal Quantum Sample Complexity of Learning Algorithms,Srinivasan Arunachalam;Ronald de Wolf,"$ \newcommand{\eps}{\varepsilon} $In learning theory, the VC dimension of a concept class $C$ is the most common way to measure its ""richness."" In the PAC model $$ \Theta\Big(\fracd\eps + \frac\log(1/\delta)\eps\Big) $$ examples are necessary and sufficient for a learner to output, with probability $1-\delta$, a hypothesis $h$ that is $\eps$-close to the target concept $c$. In the related agnostic model, where the samples need not come from a $c\in C$, we know that $$ \Theta\Big(\fracd\eps^2 + \frac\log(1/\delta)\eps^2\Big) $$ examples are necessary and sufficient to output an hypothesis $h\in C$ whose error is at most $\eps$ worse than the best concept in $C$. Here we analyze quantum sample complexity, where each example is a coherent quantum state. This model was introduced by Bshouty and Jackson, who showed that quantum examples are more powerful than classical examples in some fixed-distribution settings. However, Atici and Servedio, improved by Zhang, showed that in the PAC setting, quantum examples cannot be much more powerful: the required number of quantum examples is $$ \Omega\Big(\fracd^1-\eta\eps + d + \frac\log(1/\delta)\eps\Big)\mbox for all \eta> 0. $$ Our main result is that quantum and classical sample complexity are in fact equal up to constant factors in both the PAC and agnostic models. We give two approaches. The first is a fairly simple information-theoretic argument that yields the above two classical bounds and yields the same bounds for quantum sample complexity up to a $\log(d/\eps)$ factor. We then give a second approach that avoids the log-factor loss, based on analyzing the behavior of the ""Pretty Good Measurement"" on the quantum state identification problems that correspond to learning. This shows classical and quantum sample complexity are equal up to constant factors."
500,1606.01904,2016,10,24,22,A unified framework for magic state distillation and multi-qubit gate-synthesis with reduced resource cost,Earl T Campbell;Mark Howard,"The standard approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation is to store information in a quantum error correction code, such as the surface code, and process information using a strategy that can be summarized as distill-then-synthesize. In the distill step, one performs several rounds of distillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such magic state provides one good $T$ gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the optimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many $T$ gates interleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood for multi-qubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth analysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and multi-qubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation protocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This is because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the same number of $T$-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic error suppression. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a costly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional results on the multi-qubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient algorithm for synthesising unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling as optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing controlled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly optimal. We observe that the gate-synthesis cost, measured by $T$-count, is often strictly subadditive. Numerous explicit applications of our techniques are also presented."

We review the idea that the informational principle of minimal complexity determines a dual holographic bulk spacetime from a minimal quantum circuit U preparing a given boundary state from a trivial reference state. We describe how this idea may be extended to determine the relationship between the fluctuations of the bulk holographic geometry and the fluctuations of the boundary low-energy subspace. In this way we obtain, for every quantum system, an Einstein-like equation of motion for what might be interpreted as a bulk gravity theory dual to the boundary system."

We disprove both conjectures by explicitly constructing a special class of mixed two-qubit states. We then introduce an additive semidefinite programming (SDP) lower bound $E_M$ for the asymptotic Rains' bound, and it immediately becomes a computable lower bound for entanglement cost of bipartite states. Furthermore, $E_M$ is also proved to be the best known upper bound of the PPT-assisted deterministic distillable entanglement, and gives the asymptotic rates for all pure states and some class of genuinely mixed states."
503,1603.03999,2016,6,9,22,The Classification of Stabilizer Operations over Qubits,Daniel Grier;Luke Schaeffer,"We present a complete classification of quantum stabilizer gates in terms of the functions they generate assuming the ability to swap qubits and use ancillary workspace. Because we view these stabilizer circuits as subroutines of some general quantum computation, we insist that any ancilla qubits used during the computation must not change in an input-dependent manner. This is the first attempt at a quantum extension of the classification of reversible classical gates introduced by Aaronson et al., another part of an ambitious program to classify all quantum gate sets. The classification uses, at its center, a reinterpretation of the tableau representation of stabilizer gates to give circuit decompositions, from which elementary generators can easily be extracted. There are a total of 57 different stabilizer classes generated in this way, 30 of which arise from the single-qubit subgroups of the Clifford group. At a high level, the remaining classes are arranged according to the bases they preserve. For instance, the CNOT gate preserves the X and Z bases because it maps X-basis elements to X-basis elements and Z-basis elements to Z-basis elements. The remaining classes are characterized by more subtle tableau invariants; for instance, the T_4 and phase gate generate a proper subclass of Z-preserving gates."
504,1512.04193,2015,6,8,22,Gauge color codes in two dimensions,Cody Jones;Peter Brooks;Jim Harrington,"We present a family of quantum error-correcting codes that support a universal set of transversal logic gates using only local operations on a two-dimensional array of physical qubits. The construction is a subsystem version of color codes where gauge fixing through local measurements dynamically determines which gates are transversal. Although the operations are local, the underlying code is not topological in structure, which is how the construction circumvents no-go constraints imposed by the Bravyi-König and Pastawski-Yoshida theorems. We provide strong evidence that the encoding has no error threshold in the conventional sense, though it is still possible to have logical gates with error probability much lower than that of physical gates."
505,1512.00602,2015,5,26,22,Relativistic quantum cryptography,Jędrzej Kaniewski,"In this thesis we explore the benefits of relativistic constraints for cryptography. We first revisit non-communicating models and its applications in the context of interactive proofs and cryptography. We propose bit commitment protocols whose security hinges on communication constraints and investigate its limitations. We explain how some non-communicating models can be justified by special relativity and study the limitations of such models. In particular, we present a framework for analysing security of multiround relativistic protocols. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to analysing specific protocols. We start by considering a recently proposed two-round quantum bit commitment protocol. We propose a fault-tolerant variant of the protocol, present a complete security analysis and report on an experimental implementation performed in collaboration with an experimental group at the University of Geneva. We also propose a new, multiround classical bit commitment protocol and prove its security against classical adversaries. This demonstrates that in the classical world an arbitrarily long commitment can be achieved even if the agents are restricted to occupy a finite region of space. Moreover, the protocol is easy to implement and we report on an experiment performed in collaboration with the Geneva group."

Derivations of these laws assume that an experimenter has very precise control of the system and heat bath. Here we show that these multitude of laws can be saturated using two very simple operations: changing the energy levels of the system and thermalizing over any two system energy levels. Using these two operations, one can distill the optimal amount of work from a system, as well as perform the reverse formation process. Even more surprisingly, using only these two operations and one ancilla qubit in a thermal state, one can transform any state into any other state allowable by the second laws. We thus have the remarkable result that the second laws hold for fine-grained manipulation of system and bath, but can be achieved using very coarse control. This brings the full array of thermal operations into a regime accessible by experiment, and establishes the physical relevance of these second laws."

We ensure that all relevant events in our Bell test are spacelike separated by placing the parties far enough apart and by using fast random number generators and high-speed polarization measurements. A high-quality polarization-entangled source of photons, combined with high-efficiency, low-noise, single-photon detectors, allows us to make measurements without requiring any fair-sampling assumptions. Using a hypothesis test, we compute p-values as small as $5.9\times 10^{-9}$ for our Bell violation while maintaining the spacelike separation of our events. We estimate the degree to which a local realistic system could predict our measurement choices. Accounting for this predictability, our smallest adjusted p-value is $2.3 \times 10^{-7}$. We therefore reject the hypothesis that local realism governs our experiment."
508,1511.02839,2015,12,15,22,Instantaneous non-local computation of low T-depth quantum circuits,Florian Speelman,"Instantaneous non-local quantum computation requires multiple parties to jointly perform a quantum operation, using pre-shared entanglement and a single round of simultaneous communication. We study this task for its close connection to position-based quantum cryptography, but it also has natural applications in the context of foundations of quantum physics and in distributed computing. The best known general construction for instantaneous non-local quantum computation requires a pre-shared state which is exponentially large in the number of qubits involved in the operation, while efficient constructions are known for very specific cases only. We partially close this gap by presenting new schemes for efficient instantaneous non-local computation of several classes of quantum circuits, using the Clifford+T gate set. Our main result is a protocol which uses entanglement exponential in the T-depth of a quantum circuit, able to perform non-local computation of quantum circuits with a (poly-)logarithmic number of layers of T gates with quasi-polynomial entanglement. Our proofs combine ideas from blind and delegated quantum computation with the garden-hose model, a combinatorial model of communication complexity which was recently introduced as a tool for studying certain schemes for quantum position verification. As an application of our results, we also present an efficient attack on a recently-proposed scheme for position verification by Chakraborty and Leverrier."

Within the paradigm of compressed sensing, this is made computationally efficient by minimizing the nuclear norm as a convex surrogate for rank. In this work, we identify an improved regularizer based on the so-called diamond norm, a concept imported from quantum information theory. We show that - for a class of matrices saturating a certain norm inequality - the descent cone of the diamond norm is contained in that of the nuclear norm. This suggests superior reconstruction properties for these matrices and we explicitly characterize this set. We demonstrate numerically that the diamond norm indeed outperforms the nuclear norm in a number of relevant applications: These include signal analysis tasks such as blind matrix deconvolution or the retrieval of certain unitary basis changes, as well as the quantum information problem of process tomography with random measurements. The diamond norm is defined for matrices that can be interpreted as order-4 tensors and it turns out that the above condition depends crucially on that tensorial structure. In this sense, this work touches on an aspect of the notoriously difficult tensor completion problem."

Benchmarking procedures that scale to enable characterization of $n$-qubit circuits rely on efficient procedures for manipulating those circuits and, as such, have been limited to subgroups of the Clifford group. However, universal quantum computers require additional, non-Clifford gates to approximate arbitrary unitary transformations. We define a scalable randomized benchmarking procedure over $n$-qubit unitary matrices that correspond to protected non-Clifford gates for a class of stabilizer codes. We present efficient methods for representing and composing group elements, sampling them uniformly, and synthesizing corresponding $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-sized circuits. The procedure provides experimental access to two independent parameters that together characterize the average gate fidelity of a group element."
511,1510.00377,2015,11,11,22,Reversible circuit compilation with space constraints,Alex Parent;Martin Roetteler;Krysta M Svore,"We develop a framework for resource efficient compilation of higher-level programs into lower-level reversible circuits. Our main focus is on optimizing the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by the limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three main techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing classical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first, wherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to modify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is introduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing to clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to ""garbage collection"" for reversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to transform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space constraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed. We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a subset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which can then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific language for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a number of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including reversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions, reversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational circuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method, REVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an only moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to compile the reversible networks."
512,1510.00102,2015,11,10,22,Interactive proofs with approximately commuting provers,Matthew Coudron;Thomas Vidick,"The class $\MIP^*$ of promise problems that can be decided through an interactive proof system with multiple entangled provers provides a complexity-theoretic framework for the exploration of the nonlocal properties of entanglement. Little is known about the power of this class. The only proposed approach for establishing upper bounds is based on a hierarchy of semidefinite programs introduced independently by Pironio et al. and Doherty et al. This hierarchy converges to a value that is only known to coincide with the provers' maximum success probability in a given proof system under a plausible but difficult mathematical conjecture, Connes' embedding conjecture. No bounds on the rate of convergence are known. We introduce a rounding scheme for the hierarchy, establishing that any solution to its $N$-th level can be mapped to a strategy for the provers in which measurement operators associated with distinct provers have pairwise commutator bounded by $O(\ell^2/\sqrt{N})$ in operator norm, where $\ell$ is the number of possible answers per prover. Our rounding scheme motivates the introduction of a variant of $\MIP^*$, called $\MIP_\delta^*$, in which the soundness property is required to hold as long as the commutator of operations performed by distinct provers has norm at most $\delta$. Our rounding scheme implies the upper bound $\MIP_\delta^* \subseteq \DTIME(\exp(\exp(\poly)/\delta^2))$. In terms of lower bounds we establish that $\MIP^*_{2^{-\poly}}$, with completeness $1$ and soundness $1-2^{-\poly}$, contains $\NEXP$. The relationship of $\MIP_\delta^*$ to $\MIPstar$ has connections with the mathematical literature on approximate commutation. Our rounding scheme gives an elementary proof that the Strong Kirchberg Conjecture implies that $\MIPstar$ is computable. We discuss applications to device-independent cryptography."

We provide a renormalization group picture by interpreting this compression as an application of Wilson's numerical renormalization group along the imaginary time direction appearing in the path integral representation of the state. The location of the physical index is considered as an impurity in the transfer matrix and static MPS correlation functions are reinterpreted as dynamical impurity correlations. Coarse-graining the transfer matrix is performed using a hybrid variational ansatz based on matrix product operators, combining ideas of MPS and the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz. Through numerical comparison with conventional MPS algorithms, we explicitly verify the impurity interpretation of MPS compression, as put forward by [V. Zauner et al., New J. Phys. 17, 053002 (2015)] for the transverse-field Ising model. Additionally, we motivate the conceptual usefulness of endowing MPS with an internal layered structure by studying restricted variational subspaces to describe elementary excitations on top of the ground state, which serves to elucidate a transparent renormalization group structure ingrained in MPS descriptions of ground states."

Here, we call an uncertainty relation optimal, if the lower bound can be attained for any value of either of the corresponding uncertainties. In this work we establish optimal uncertainty relations by characterising the optimal lower bound in scenarios similar to the Maassen-Uffink type. We disprove a conjecture by Englert et al. and generalise various previous results. However, we are still far from a complete understanding and, based on numerical investigation and analytical results in small dimension, we present a number of conjectures."

Quantum computers can be exponentially faster than conventional computers for problems such as factoring. Besides full-scale quantum computers, more restricted models such as quantum versions of finite automata have been studied. In this paper, we survey various models of quantum finite automata and their properties. We also provide some open questions and new directions for researchers."
516,1506.08883,2015,10,2,22,How Quantum Are Non-Negative Wavefunctions?,Matthew B Hastings,"We consider wavefunctions which are non-negative in some tensor product basis. We study what possible teleportation can occur in such wavefunctions, giving a complete answer in some cases (when one system is a qubit) and partial answers elsewhere. We use this to show that a one-dimensional wavefunction which is non-negative and has zero correlation length can be written in a ""coherent Gibbs state"" form, as explained later. We conjecture that such holds in higher dimensions. Additionally, some results are provided on possible teleportation in general wavefunctions, explaining how Schmidt coefficients before measurement limit the possible Schmidt coefficients after measurement, and on the absence of a ""generalized area law""\citegenarealaw even for Hamiltonians with no sign problem. One of the motivations for this work is an attempt to prove a conjecture about ground state wavefunctions which have an ""intrinsic"" sign problem that cannot be removed by any quantum circuit. We show a weaker version of this, showing that the sign problem is intrinsic for commuting Hamiltonians in the same phase as the double semion model under the technical assumption that TQO-2 holds\citetqo2."

Problems of this form include the entangled value of two-prover games, entanglement-assisted coding for classical channels and quantum-proof randomness extractors. We introduce an asymptotically converging hierarchy of efficiently computable semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations for this quantum optimization. This allows us to give upper bounds on the quantum advantage for all of these problems. Compared to previous work of Pironio, Navascues and Acin, our hierarchy has additional constraints. By means of examples, we illustrate the importance of these new constraints both in practice and for analytical properties. Moreover, this allows us to give a hierarchy of SDP outer approximations for the completely positive semidefinite cone introduced by Laurent and Piovesan."
518,1506.07002,2015,7,9,22,Parallel repetition and concentration for (sub-)no-signalling games via a flexible constrained de Finetti reduction,Cécilia Lancien;Andreas Winter,"We use a recently discovered constrained de Finetti reduction (aka ""Post-Selection Lemma"") to study the parallel repetition of multi-player non-local games under no-signalling strategies. Since the technique allows us to reduce general strategies to independent plays, we obtain parallel repetition (corresponding to winning all rounds) in the same way as exponential concentration of the probability to win a fraction larger than the value of the game. Our proof technique leads us naturally to a relaxation of no-signalling (NS) strategies, which we dub sub-no-signalling (SNOS). While for two players the two concepts coincide, they differ for three or more players. Our results are most complete and satisfying for arbitrary number of sub-no-signalling players, where we get universal parallel repetition and concentration for any game, while the no-signalling case is obtained as a corollary, but only for games with ""full support""."
519,1506.03542,2015,7,1,22,Efficient Quantum Compression for Ensembles of Identically Prepared Mixed States,Yuxiang Yang;Giulio Chiribella;Daniel Ebler,"We present one-shot compression protocols that optimally encode ensembles of $N$ identically prepared mixed states into $O(\log N)$ qubits. In contrast to the case of pure-state ensembles, we find that the number of encoding qubits drops down discontinuously as soon as a nonzero error is tolerated and the spectrum of the states is known with sufficient precision. For qubit ensembles, this feature leads to a 25% saving of memory space. Our compression protocols can be implemented efficiently on a quantum computer."

This entropy increase can be quantified by a logarithmic-Sobolev constant of the Liouvillian generating the noise. We prove a universal lower bound on this constant that stays invariant under taking tensor-powers. Our methods involve a new comparison method to relate logarithmic-Sobolev constants of different Liouvillians and a technique to compute logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities of Liouvillians with eigenvectors forming a projective representation of a finite abelian group. Our bounds improve upon similar results established before and as an application we prove an upper bound on continuous-time quantum capacities. In the last part of this work we study entropy production estimates of discrete-time doubly-stochastic quantum channels by extending the framework of discrete-time logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities to the quantum case."
521,1503.08800,2015,6,24,22,Qudit Colour Codes and Gauge Colour Codes in All Spatial Dimensions,Fern H E Watson;Earl T Campbell;Hussain Anwar;Daniel E Browne,"Two-level quantum systems, qubits, are not the only basis for quantum computation. Advantages exist in using qudits, d-level quantum systems, as the basic carrier of quantum information. We show that color codes, a class of topological quantum codes with remarkable transversality properties, can be generalized to the qudit paradigm. In recent developments it was found that in three spatial dimensions a qubit color code can support a transversal non-Clifford gate, and that in higher spatial dimensions additional non-Clifford gates can be found, saturating Bravyi and König's bound [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 170503 (2013)]. Furthermore, by using gauge fixing techniques, an effective set of Clifford gates can be achieved, removing the need for state distillation. We show that the qudit color code can support the qudit analogues of these gates, and show that in higher spatial dimensions a color code can support a phase gate from higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy which can be proven to saturate Bravyi and König's bound in all but a finite number of special cases. The methodology used is a generalisation of Bravyi and Haah's method of triorthogonal matrices [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], which may be of independent interest. For completeness, we show explicitly that the qudit color codes generalize to gauge color codes, and share the many of the favorable properties of their qubit counterparts."
522,1503.04822,2015,6,12,22,Renormalising entanglement distillation,Stephan Waeldchen;Janina Gertis;Earl T Campbell;Jens Eisert,"Entanglement distillation refers to the task of transforming a collection of weakly entangled pairs into fewer highly entangled ones. It is a core ingredient in quantum repeater protocols, needed to transmit entanglement over arbitrary distances in order to realise quantum key distribution schemes. Usually, it is assumed that the initial entangled pairs are i.i.d. distributed and uncorrelated with each other, an assumption that might not be reasonable at all in any entanglement generation process involving memory channels. Here, we introduce a framework that captures entanglement distillation in the presence of natural correlations arising from memory channels. Conceptually, we bring together ideas from condensed-matter physics - that of renormalisation and of matrix-product states and operators - with those of local entanglement manipulation, Markov chain mixing, and quantum error correction. We identify meaningful parameter regions for which we prove convergence to maximally entangled states, arising as the fixed points of a matrix-product operator renormalisation flow."
523,1503.03100,2015,5,19,22,Minimax quantum tomography: the ultimate bounds on accuracy,Christopher Ferrie;Robin Blume-Kohout,"A minimax estimator has the minimum possible error (""risk"") in the worst case. We construct the first minimax estimators for quantum state tomography with relative entropy risk. The minimax risk of non-adaptive tomography scales as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, in contrast to that of classical probability estimation which is $O(1/N)$. We trace this deficiency to sampling mismatch: future observations that determine risk may come from a different sample space than the past data that determine the estimate. This makes minimax estimators very biased, and we propose a computationally tractable alternative with similar behavior in the worst case, but superior accuracy on most states."
524,1412.8766,2014,3,31,22,Quantum homomorphic encryption for circuits of low $T$-gate complexity,Anne Broadbent;Stacey Jeffery,"Fully homomorphic encryption is an encryption method with the property that any computation on the plaintext can be performed by a party having access to the ciphertext only. Here, we formally define and give schemes for quantum homomorphic encryption, which is the encryption of quantum information such that quantum computations can be performed given the ciphertext only. Our schemes allows for arbitrary Clifford group gates, but become inefficient for circuits with large complexity, measured in terms of the non-Clifford portion of the circuit (we use the ""$\pi/8$"" non-Clifford group gate, which is also known as the $T$-gate). More specifically, two schemes are proposed: the first scheme has a decryption procedure whose complexity scales with the square of the number of $T$-gates (compared with a trivial scheme in which the complexity scales with the total number of gates); the second scheme uses a quantum evaluation key of length given by a polynomial of degree exponential in the circuit's $T$-gate depth, yielding a homomorphic scheme for quantum circuits with constant $T$-depth. Both schemes build on a classical fully homomorphic encryption scheme. A further contribution of ours is to formally define the security of encryption schemes for quantum messages: we define quantum indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks in both the public and private-key settings. In this context, we show the equivalence of several definitions. Our schemes are the first of their kind that are secure under modern cryptographic definitions, and can be seen as a quantum analogue of classical results establishing homomorphic encryption for circuits with a limited number of multiplication gates. Historically, such results appeared as precursors to the breakthrough result establishing classical fully homomorphic encryption."
525,1412.8671,2014,3,18,22,Computation in generalised probabilistic theories,Ciarán M Lee;Jonathan Barrett,"From the existence of an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring, it is likely that quantum computation is intrinsically more powerful than classical computation. At present, the best upper bound known for the power of quantum computation is that BQP is in AWPP. This work investigates limits on computational power that are imposed by physical principles. To this end, we define a circuit-based model of computation in a class of operationally-defined theories more general than quantum theory, and ask: what is the minimal set of physical assumptions under which the above inclusion still holds? We show that given only an assumption of tomographic locality (roughly, that multipartite states can be characterised by local measurements), efficient computations are contained in AWPP. This inclusion still holds even without assuming a basic notion of causality (where the notion is, roughly, that probabilities for outcomes cannot depend on future measurement choices). Following Aaronson, we extend the computational model by allowing post-selection on measurement outcomes. Aaronson showed that the corresponding quantum complexity class is equal to PP. Given only the assumption of tomographic locality, the inclusion in PP still holds for post-selected computation in general theories. Thus in a world with post-selection, quantum theory is optimal for computation in the space of all general theories. We then consider if relativised complexity results can be obtained for general theories. It is not clear how to define a sensible notion of an oracle in the general framework that reduces to the standard notion in the quantum case. Nevertheless, it is possible to define computation relative to a `classical oracle'. Then, we show there exists a classical oracle relative to which efficient computation in any theory satisfying the causality assumption and tomographic locality does not include NP."

The input is a set of linear equations each of which contains exactly three boolean variables and each equation says that the sum of the variables mod 2 is 0 or is 1. Every variable is in no more than D equations. A random string will satisfy 1/2 of the equations. We show that the level one QAOA will efficiently produce a string that satisfies $\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{101 D^{1/2}\, l n\, D}\right)$ times the number of equations. A recent classical algorithm achieved $\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{constant}{D^{1/2}}\right)$. We also show that in the typical case the quantum computer will output a string that satisfies $\left(\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3e}\, D^{1/2}}\right)$ times the number of equations."
527,1412.4067,2014,12,31,22,Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and recoverability,Mario Berta;Marius Lemm;Mark M Wilde,"The relative entropy is a principal measure of distinguishability in quantum information theory, with its most important property being that it is non-increasing with respect to noisy quantum operations. Here, we establish a remainder term for this inequality that quantifies how well one can recover from a loss of information by employing a rotated Petz recovery map. The main approach for proving this refinement is to combine the methods of [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664] with the notion of a relative typical subspace from [Bjelakovic and Siegmund-Schultze, arXiv:quant-ph/0307170]. Our paper constitutes partial progress towards a remainder term which features just the Petz recovery map (not a rotated Petz map), a conjecture which would have many consequences in quantum information theory. A well known result states that the monotonicity of relative entropy with respect to quantum operations is equivalent to each of the following inequalities: strong subadditivity of entropy, concavity of conditional entropy, joint convexity of relative entropy, and monotonicity of relative entropy with respect to partial trace. We show that this equivalence holds true for refinements of all these inequalities in terms of the Petz recovery map. So either all of these refinements are true or all are false."

Our presentation is self-contained, and assumes only basic concepts from quantum error correction. We provide an explicit construction of a family of color codes in arbitrary dimensions and describe some of their crucial properties. Within this framework, we explicitly show how to transversally implement the generalized phase gate $R_n=\text{diag}(1,e^{2\pi i/2^n})$, which deviates from the method in ""Gauge Color Codes"", allowing an arguably simpler proof. We describe how to implement the Hadamard gate $H$ fault-tolerantly using code switching. In three dimensions, this yields, together with the transversal $CNOT$, a fault-tolerant universal gate set $\{H,CNOT,R_3\}$ without state-distillation."

The technique is largely inspired by Wolfowitz's combinatorial approach using types of sequences. As a by-product of our approach which is independent of previous ones, both in the coding theorem and the converse, we can give a new proof of Holevo's information bound."

We build upon these results by showing that a small quantum simulators can be used to characterize and learn control models for larger devices for wide classes of physically realistic Hamiltonians. This leads to a new application for small quantum computers: characterizing and controlling larger quantum computers. Our protocol achieves this by using Bayesian inference in concert with Lieb-Robinson bounds and interactive quantum learning methods to achieve compressed simulations for characterization. Whereas Fisher information analysis shows that current methods which employ short-time evolution are suboptimal, interactive quantum learning allows us to overcome this limitation. We illustrate the efficiency of our bootstrapping protocol by showing numerically that an 8-qubit Ising model simulator can be used to calibrate and control a 50 qubit Ising simulator while using only about 750 kilobits of experimental data."

532,1407.8202,2014,9,10,22,Efficient Approximation of Quantum Channel Capacities,David Sutter;Tobias Sutter;Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani;Renato Renner,"We propose an iterative method for approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a discrete input alphabet and a finite dimensional output, possibly under additional constraints on the input distribution. Based on duality of convex programming, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the capacity. To provide an $\varepsilon$-close estimate to the capacity, the presented algorithm requires $O(\tfrac{(N \vee M) M^3 \log(N)^{1/2}}{\varepsilon})$, where $N$ denotes the input alphabet size and $M$ the output dimension. We then generalize the method for the task of approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a bounded continuous input alphabet and a finite dimensional output. For channels with a finite dimensional quantum mechanical input and output, the idea of a universal encoder allows us to approximate the Holevo capacity using the same method. In particular, we show that the problem of approximating the Holevo capacity can be reduced to a multidimensional integration problem. For families of quantum channels fulfilling a certain assumption we show that the complexity to derive an $\varepsilon$-close solution to the Holevo capacity is subexponential or even polynomial in the problem size. We provide several examples to illustrate the performance of the approximation scheme in practice."
533,1407.2320,2014,9,5,22,A unified view on Hardy's paradox and the CHSH inequality,Laura Mančinska;Stephanie Wehner,"Bell's inequality fundamentally changed our understanding of quantum mechanics. Bell's insight that non-local correlations between quantum systems cannot be explained classically can be verified experimentally, and has numerous applications in modern quantum information. Today, the CHSH inequality is probably the most well-known Bell inequality and it has given us a wealth of understanding in what differentiates the classical from the quantum world. Yet, there are certainly other means of quantifying ""Bell non-locality without inequalities"" such as the famous Hardy's paradox. As such, one may wonder whether these are entirely different approaches to non-locality. For this anniversary issue, we unify the perspective of the CHSH inequality and Hardy Paradox into one family of non-local games which include both as special cases."

Certain cases of quantum rewinding are handled by the results by Watrous (SIAM J Comput, 2009) and Unruh (Eurocrypt 2012), yet in general the problem remains elusive. We show that this is not only due to a lack of proof techniques: relative to an oracle, we show that classically secure proofs and proofs of knowledge are insecure in the quantum setting. More specifically, sigma-protocols, the Fiat-Shamir construction, and Fischlin's proof system are quantum insecure under assumptions that are sufficient for classical security. Additionally, we show that for similar reasons, computationally binding commitments provide almost no security guarantees in a quantum setting. To show these results, we develop the ""pick-one trick"", a general technique that allows an adversary to find one value satisfying a given predicate, but not two."

Quantum states and operations can be protected from errors using protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Here we present a step towards this by implementing a quantum error correcting code, encoding one qubit in entangled states distributed over 7 trapped-ion qubits. We demonstrate the capability of the code to detect one bit flip, phase flip or a combined error of both, regardless on which of the qubits they occur. Furthermore, we apply combinations of the entire set of logical single-qubit Clifford gates on the encoded qubit to explore its computational capabilities. The implemented 7-qubit code is the first realization of a complete Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code and constitutes a central building block for FTQC schemes based on concatenated elementary quantum codes. It also represents the smallest fully functional instance of the color code, opening a route towards topological FTQC."

Hence, computer science should not only be regarded as an applied science; it is also of central importance to the foundations of science."

The standard Feynman-Kitaev construction uses one global clock for all qubits while we consider a different construction in which a clock is assigned to each interacting qubit. This makes it possible to capture the spatio-temporal structure of the original quantum circuit into features of the circuit Hamiltonian. The construction is inspired by the original two-dimensional interacting fermionic model (see http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.63.040302) We prove that for one-dimensional quantum circuits the gap of the circuit Hamiltonian is appropriately lower-bounded, partially using results on mixing times of Markov chains, so that the applications of this construction for QMA (and partially for quantum adiabatic computation) go through. For one-dimensional quantum circuits, the dynamics generated by the circuit Hamiltonian corresponds to diffusion of a string around the torus."
540,1310.6749,2013,3,24,22,Simulating Quantum Circuits with Sparse Output Distributions,Martin Schwarz;Maarten Van den Nest,"We show that several quantum circuit families can be simulated efficiently classically if it is promised that their output distribution is approximately sparse i.e. the distribution is close to one where only a polynomially small, a priori unknown subset of the measurement probabilities are nonzero. Classical simulations are thereby obtained for quantum circuits which---without the additional sparsity promise---are considered hard to simulate. Our results apply in particular to a family of Fourier sampling circuits (which have structural similarities to Shor's factoring algorithm) but also to several other circuit families, such as IQP circuits. Our results provide examples of quantum circuits that cannot achieve exponential speed-ups due to the presence of too much destructive interference i.e. too many cancelations of amplitudes. The crux of our classical simulation is an efficient algorithm for approximating the significant Fourier coefficients of a class of states called computationally tractable states. The latter result may have applications beyond the scope of this work. In the proof we employ and extend sparse approximation techniques, in particular the Kushilevitz-Mansour algorithm, in combination with probabilistic simulation methods for quantum circuits."
541,1310.3235,2013,1,21,22,Hardness of decoding quantum stabilizer codes,Pavithran Iyer;David Poulin,"In this article we address the computational hardness of optimally decoding a quantum stabilizer code. Much like classical linear codes, errors are detected by measuring certain check operators which yield an error syndrome, and the decoding problem consists of determining the most likely recovery given the syndrome. The corresponding classical problem is known to be NP-complete, and a similar decoding problem for quantum codes is also known to be NP-complete. However, this decoding strategy is not optimal in the quantum setting as it does not take into account error degeneracy, which causes distinct errors to have the same effect on the code. Here, we show that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is computationally much harder than optimal decoding of classical linear codes, it is #P."
542,1309.7062,2013,11,26,22,Fibre bundle framework for unitary quantum fault tolerance,Daniel Gottesman;Lucy Liuxuan Zhang,"We introduce a differential geometric framework for describing families of quantum error-correcting codes and for understanding quantum fault tolerance. This work unifies the notion of topological fault tolerance with fault tolerance in other kinds of quantum error-correcting codes. In particular, we use fibre bundles with a natural flat projective connection to study the transformation of codewords under unitary fault-tolerant evolutions. We show that the fault-tolerant logical operations are given by the monodromy group for either of two bundles, both of which have flat projective connections. As concrete realizations of the general framework, we construct the bundles explicitly for two examples of fault-tolerant families of operations, the qudit transversal gates and the string operators in the toric code."

It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1d and 2d quantum lattice systems are also discussed."
544,1609.08571,2016,10,14,21,Increasing the quantum UNSAT penalty of the circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction,Johannes Bausch;Elizabeth Crosson,"The Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonian used in the proof of QMA-completeness of the local Hamiltonian problem has a ground state energy which scales as $\Omega((1-\sqrt{\epsilon}) T^{-3})$ when it is applied to a circuit of size $T$ and maximum acceptance probability $\epsilon$. We refer to this quantity as the quantum UNSAT penalty, and using a modified form of the Feynman Hamiltonian with a non-uniform history state as its ground state we improve its scaling to $\Omega((1-\sqrt{\epsilon})T^{-2})$, without increasing the number of local terms or their operator norms. As part of the proof we show how to construct a circuit Hamiltonian for any desired probability distribution on the time steps of the quantum circuit (which, for example, can be used to increase the probability of measuring a history state in the final step of the computation). Next we show a tight $\mathcal{O}(T^{-2})$ upper bound on the product of the spectral gap and ground state overlap with the endpoints of the computation for any clock Hamiltonian that is tridiagonal in the time register basis, which shows that the scaling of the quantum UNSAT penalty achieved by our construction cannot be further improved within this framework. Our proof of the upper bound applies a quantum-to-classical mapping for arbitrary tridiagonal Hermitian matrices combined with a sharp bound on the spectral gap of birth-and-death Markov chains. In the context of universal adiabatic computation we show how to reduce the number of qubits required to represent the clock by a constant factor over the standard construction, but show that it is otherwise already optimal in the sense we consider and cannot be further improved with tridiagonal clock Hamiltonians, which agrees with a similar upper bound from a previous study."

Linear network codes are examples of such protocols in which the local computations performed at the nodes in the network are limited to linear transformations of their input data (represented as elements of a ring, such as the integers modulo 2). The quantum linear network coding protocols of Kobayashi et al [arXiv:0908.1457 and arXiv:1012.4583] coherently simulate classical linear network codes, using supplemental classical communication. We demonstrate that these protocols correspond in a natural way to measurement-based quantum computations with graph states over over qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0301052, arXiv:quant-ph/0603226, and arXiv:0704.1263] having a structure directly related to the network."

However, the cost, size, and power requirements of current QRNGs has prevented them from becoming widespread. In the meantime, the quality of the cameras integrated in mobile telephones has improved significantly, so that now they are sensitive to light at the few-photon level. We demonstrate how these can be used to generate random numbers of a quantum origin."
547,1402.3626,2014,9,28,21,Strong converse for the quantum capacity of the erasure channel for almost all codes,Mark M Wilde;Andreas Winter,"A strong converse theorem for channel capacity establishes that the error probability in any communication scheme for a given channel necessarily tends to one if the rate of communication exceeds the channel's capacity. Establishing such a theorem for the quantum capacity of degradable channels has been an elusive task, with the strongest progress so far being a so-called ""pretty strong converse"". In this work, Morgan and Winter proved that the quantum error of any quantum communication scheme for a given degradable channel converges to a value larger than $1/\sqrt{2}$ in the limit of many channel uses if the quantum rate of communication exceeds the channel's quantum capacity. The present paper establishes a theorem that is a counterpart to this ""pretty strong converse"". We prove that the large fraction of codes having a rate exceeding the erasure channel's quantum capacity have a quantum error tending to one in the limit of many channel uses. Thus, our work adds to the body of evidence that a fully strong converse theorem should hold for the quantum capacity of the erasure channel. As a side result, we prove that the classical capacity of the quantum erasure channel obeys the strong converse property."
548,1309.3310,2013,3,17,21,Using concatenated quantum codes for universal fault-tolerant quantum gates,Tomas Jochym-O'Connor;Raymond Laflamme,"We propose a method for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using concatenated quantum error correcting codes. Namely, other than computational basis state preparation as required by the DiVincenzo criteria [1], our scheme requires no special ancillary state preparation to achieve universality, as opposed to schemes such as magic state distillation. The concatenation scheme exploits the transversal properties of two different codes, combining them to provide a means to protect against low-weight arbitrary errors. We give the required properties of the error correcting codes to ensure universal fault-tolerance and discuss a particular example using the 7-qubit Steane and 15-qubit Reed-Muller codes. We believe that optimizing the codes used in such a scheme could provide a useful alternative to state distillation schemes that exhibit high overhead costs."

Gradient descent algorithms find local minima by moving along the direction of steepest descent while Newton's method takes into account curvature information and thereby often improves convergence. Here, we develop quantum versions of these iterative optimization algorithms and apply them to homogeneous polynomial optimization with a unit norm constraint. In each step, multiple copies of the current candidate are used to improve the candidate using quantum phase estimation, an adapted quantum principal component analysis scheme, as well as quantum matrix multiplications and inversions. The required operations perform polylogarithmically in the dimension of the solution vector, an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms, which scale polynomially. The quantum algorithm can therefore be beneficial for high dimensional problems where a relatively small number of iterations is sufficient."
550,1611.10107,2016,2,18,21,Private quantum computation: An introduction to blind quantum computing and related protocols,Joseph F Fitzsimons,"Quantum technologies hold the promise of not only faster algorithmic processing of data, via quantum computation, but also of more secure communications, in the form of quantum cryptography. In recent years, a number of protocols have emerged which seek to marry these concepts for the purpose of securing computation rather than communication. These protocols address the task of securely delegating quantum computation to an untrusted device while maintaining the privacy, and in some instances the integrity, of the computation. We present a review of the progress to date in this emerging area."
551,1611.07332,2016,9,14,21,Robustness of QMA against witness noise,Friederike Anna Dziemba,"Using the tool of concatenated stabilizer coding, we prove that the complexity class QMA remains unchanged even if every witness qubit is disturbed by constant noise. This result may not only be relevant for physical implementations of verifying protocols but also attacking the relationship between the complexity classes QMA, QCMA and BQP, which can be reformulated in this unified framework of a verifying protocol receiving a disturbed witness. While QCMA and BQP are described by fully dephasing and depolarizing channels on the witness qubits, respectively, our result proves QMA to be robust against 27% dephasing and 18% depolarizing noise."
552,1610.06897,2016,12,28,21,Contextuality under weak assumptions,Andrew W Simmons;Joel J Wallman;Hakop Pashayan;Stephen D Bartlett;Terry G Rudolph,"The presence of contextuality in quantum theory was first highlighted by Bell, Kochen and Specker, who discovered that for quantum systems of three or more dimensions, measurements cannot be viewed as revealing pre-existing properties of the system. More precisely, no model can assign deterministic outcomes to the projectors of a quantum measurement in a way that depends only on the projector and not the context (the full set of projectors) in which it appeared, despite the fact that the Born rule probabilities associated with projectors are independent of the context. A more general, operational definition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens, which we will term ""probabilistic contextuality"", drops the assumption of determinism and allows for operations other than measurements to be considered contextual. Probabilistic noncontextuality represents the postulate that elements of an operational theory that cannot be distinguished from each other based on the statistics of arbitrarily many repeated experiments are ontologically identical. In this paper, we introduce a framework that enables us to distinguish between different noncontextuality assumptions in terms of the relationships between the ontological representations of objects in the theory given a certain relation between their operational representations. This framework can be used to motivate and define a ""possibilistic"" analogue, encapsulating the idea that elements of an operational theory that cannot be unambiguously distinguished operationally can also not be unambiguously distinguished ontologically. We then prove that possibilistic noncontextuality is equivalent to an alternative notion proposed by Hardy. Finally, we demonstrate that these weaker noncontextuality assumptions are sufficient to prove alternative versions of known ""no-go"" theorems that constrain $\psi$-epistemic models for quantum mechanics."
553,1610.06546,2016,12,1,21,Hamiltonian Simulation by Qubitization,Guang Hao Low;Isaac L Chuang,"Given a Hermitian operator $\hat{H}=\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ that is the projection of an oracle $\hat{U}$ by state $|G\rangle$ created with oracle $\hat{G}$, the problem of Hamiltonian simulation is approximating the time evolution operator $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ at time $t$ with error $\epsilon$. We show that this can be done with query complexity $\mathcal{O}(t+\log{(1/\epsilon))}$ to $\hat{G},\hat{U}$ that is optimal not just in asymptotic limits, but for all values $t,\epsilon$. Furthermore, only $2$ additional ancilla qubits are required in total, together with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional single and two-qubit gates per query. Our approach to Hamiltonian simulation subsumes important prior art considering Hamiltonians which are $d$-sparse or a linear combination of unitaries, leading to significant improvements in space complexity, as well as a quadratic speed-up for precision simulations. It also motivates useful new instances, such as where $\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ is a density matrix. A key technical result is `qubitization' which uses controlled-$\hat{U}$ and controlled-$\hat{G}$ to embed $\hat{H}$ in an invariant $\text{SU}(2)$ subspace. A large class of operator functions of $\hat{H}$ can then be computed with optimal query complexity, of which $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ is a special case."
554,1610.03574,2016,11,23,21,Robust self-testing of many-qubit states,Anand Natarajan;Thomas Vidick,"We introduce a simple two-player test which certifies that the players apply tensor products of Pauli $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Z$ observables on the tensor product of $n$ EPR pairs. The test has constant robustness: any strategy achieving success probability within an additive $\varepsilon$ of the optimal must be $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$-close, in the appropriate distance measure, to the honest $n$-qubit strategy. The test involves $2n$-bit questions and $2$-bit answers. The key technical ingredient is a quantum version of the classical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld. As applications of our result we give (i) the first robust self-test for $n$ EPR pairs; (ii) a quantum multiprover interactive proof system for the local Hamiltonian problem with a constant number of provers and classical questions and answers, and a constant completeness-soundness gap independent of system size; (iii) a robust protocol for delegated quantum computation."

Via a reduction to the s-t connectivity problem, we describe quantum algorithms for deciding both properties in $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time and using $O(\log n)$ classical and quantum bits of storage in the adjacency matrix model. We then present quantum algorithms for deciding the two properties in the adjacency array model, which run in time $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d_m})$ and also require $O(\log n)$ space, where $d_m$ is the maximum degree of any vertex in the input graph."
556,1609.07496,2016,10,21,21,"Dynamical maps, quantum detailed balance and Petz recovery map",Álvaro M Alhambra;Mischa P Woods,"Markovian master equations (formally known as quantum dynamical semigroups) can be used to describe the evolution of a quantum state $\rho$ when in contact with a memoryless thermal bath. This approach has had much success in describing the dynamics of real-life open quantum systems in the lab. Such dynamics increase the entropy of the state $\rho$ and the bath until both systems reach thermal equilibrium, at which point entropy production stops. Our main result is to show that the entropy production at time $t$ is bounded by the relative entropy between the original state and the state at time $2t$. The bound puts strong constraints on how quickly a state can thermalise, and we conjecture that the factor of $2$ is tight. The proof makes use of a key physically relevant property of these dynamical semigroups -- detailed balance, showing that this property is intimately connected with the field of recovery maps from quantum information theory. We envisage that the connections made here between the two fields will have further applications. We also use this connection to show that a similar relation can be derived when the fixed point is not thermal."

The OTOC encodes forward and reverse evolutions and has deep connections with the flow of time. So do fluctuation relations such as Jarzynski's Equality, derived in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. I unite these two powerful, seemingly disparate tools by deriving a Jarzynski-like equality for the OTOC. The equality's left-hand side equals the OTOC. The right-hand side suggests a protocol for measuring the OTOC indirectly. The protocol is platform-nonspecific and can be performed with weak measurement or with interference. Time evolution need not be reversed in any interference trial. The equality opens holography, condensed matter, and quantum information to new insights from fluctuation relations and vice versa."
558,1608.06318,2016,10,4,21,Privacy Amplification Against Active Quantum Adversaries,Gil Cohen;Thomas Vidick,"Privacy amplification is the task by which two cooperating parties transform a shared weak secret, about which an eavesdropper may have side information, into a uniformly random string uncorrelated from the eavesdropper. Privacy amplification against passive adversaries, where it is assumed that the communication is over a public but authenticated channel, can be achieved in the presence of classical as well as quantum side information by a single-message protocol based on strong extractors. In 2009 Dodis and Wichs devised a two-message protocol to achieve privacy amplification against active adversaries, where the public communication channel is no longer assumed to be authenticated, through the use of a strengthening of strong extractors called non-malleable extractors which they introduced. Dodis and Wichs only analyzed the case of classical side information. We consider the task of privacy amplification against active adversaries with quantum side information. Our main result is showing that the Dodis-Wichs protocol remains secure in this scenario provided its main building block, the non-malleable extractor, satisfies a notion of quantum-proof non-malleability which we introduce. We show that an adaptation of a recent construction of non-malleable extractors due to Chattopadhyay et al. is quantum proof, thereby providing the first protocol for privacy amplification that is secure against active quantum adversaries. Our protocol is quantitatively comparable to the near-optimal protocols known in the classical setting."
559,1608.04461,2016,9,27,21,Thermodynamics and the structure of quantum theory,Marius Krumm;Howard Barnum;Jonathan Barrett;Markus P Müller,"Despite its enormous empirical success, the formalism of quantum theory still raises fundamental questions: why is nature described in terms of complex Hilbert spaces, and what modifications of it could we reasonably expect to find in some regimes of physics? Results in quantum gravity and general ideas of what a fundamental theory should look like suggest that thermodynamics plays a major role in the foundations of physics. In this paper, we address the question of which parts of quantum theory are already determined by compatibility with thermodynamics, and which aspects may still admit modification. We employ two postulates that any probabilistic theory with reasonable thermodynamic behavior should arguably satisfy. In the framework of generalized probabilistic theories, we show that these postulates already imply important aspects of quantum theory, like self-duality and analogues of projective measurements, subspaces and eigenvalues. However, they may still admit a class of theories beyond quantum mechanics. Using a thought experiment by von Neumann, we show that these theories admit a consistent thermodynamic notion of entropy, and prove that the second law holds for projective measurements and mixing procedures. Furthermore, we generalize the concept of state majorization, crucial to recent work in fine-grained quantum thermodynamics, to this class of theories, study additional entropy-like quantities based on measurement probabilities and convex decomposition probabilities, and uncover a relation between one of these quantities and Sorkin's notion of higher-order interference."

These results use the i.i.d. model of the quantum noise. In this paper we consider quantum Gaussian signal+noise model with time-continuous stationary coloured noise. A proof of the coding theorem for the classical capacity of quantum broadband gauge-covariant Gaussian channels is given. We also discuss and compare the ""broadband"" and the ""bandpass"" models of time-continuous time-continuous stationary coloured noise."

Despite being non-universal, the model cannot be classically efficiently simulated unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Equipped with the intrinsic one-instance property, a single fixed unitary evolution in our model is sufficient to produce classically intractable results, compared to several other models that rely on average-case or worst-case hardness. We propose an implementation scheme for our Hamiltonian model using cold atoms in a square lattice, with the requirements well within the reach of current experimental technology. We formulate a scheme to certify the correct functioning of this quantum machine. The certification requires only a polynomial number of local measurements assuming measurement imperfections are sufficiently small."
562,1606.03443,2016,8,17,21,Corrected quantum walk for optimal Hamiltonian simulation,Dominic W Berry;Leonardo Novo,"We describe a method to simulate Hamiltonian evolution on a quantum computer by repeatedly using a superposition of steps of a quantum walk, then applying corrections to correct the weightings for the numbers of steps of the quantum walk. This correction enables us to obtain efficiency which is the same as the lower bound up to double-logarithmic factors for all parameter regimes. The scaling of the complexity is $O\left( \tau \frac{\log\log\tau}{\log\log\log\tau} + \log(1/\epsilon) \right)$ where $\tau := t\|H\|_{\max}d$, for $\epsilon$ the allowable error, $t$ the time, $\|H\|_{\max}$ the max-norm of the Hamiltonian, and $d$ the sparseness. This technique should also be useful for improving the scaling of the Taylor series approach to simulation, which is relevant to applications such as quantum chemistry."

Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem."

Protocols that achieve this are referred to as clean and the associated cost as the clean communication complexity. Here we present clean protocols for calculating the Inner Product of two $n$-bit strings, showing that (in the absence of pre-shared entanglement) at most $n+3$ qubits or $n+O(\sqrt{n})$ bits of communication are required. The quantum protocol provides inspiration for obtaining the optimal method to implement distributed CNOT gates in parallel whilst minimizing the amount of quantum communication. For more general functions, we show that nearly all Boolean functions require close to $2n$ bits of classical communication to compute and close to $n$ qubits if the parties have access to pre-shared entanglement. Both of these values are maximal for their respective paradigms."

But since qubits are noisy and error-prone, they will depend on fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) to compute reliably. Quantum error correction can protect against general noise if -- and only if -- the error in each physical qubit operation is smaller than a certain threshold. The threshold for general errors is quantified by their diamond norm. Until now, qubits have been assessed primarily by randomized benchmarking (RB), which reports a different ""error rate"" that is not sensitive to all errors, cannot be compared directly to diamond norm thresholds, and cannot efficiently certify a qubit for FTQEC. We use gate set tomography (GST) to completely characterize the performance of a trapped-Yb$^+$-ion qubit and certify it rigorously as suitable for FTQEC by establishing that its diamond norm error rate is less than $6.7\times10^{-4}$ with $95\%$ confidence."

It is known that with quantum resources, such as entanglement and quantum channels, one can obtain significant reductions in the communication complexity of some tasks. In this work, we study the role of the quantum superposition of the direction of communication as a resource for communication complexity. We present a tripartite communication task for which such a superposition allows for an exponential saving in communication, compared to one-way quantum (or classical) communication; the advantage also holds when we allow for protocols with bounded error probability."

The bound is based on the max-relative entropy of entanglement and its proof uses a new inequality for the sandwiched Rényi divergences based on complex interpolation techniques. We provide explicit examples of quantum channels where our bound improves both the transposition bound (on the quantum capacity assisted by classical communication) and the bound based on the squashed entanglement introduced by Takeoka et al.. As an application we study a repeater version of the private capacity assisted by classical communication and provide an example of a quantum channel with negligible private repeater capacity.

We present a software architecture for compiling quantum programs from a high-level language program to hardware-specific instructions. We describe the necessary layers of abstraction and their differences and similarities to classical layers of a computer-aided design flow. For each layer of the stack, we discuss the underlying methods for compilation and optimization.

In this paper, we give an analytic reformulation of Moshkovitz's fortification framework, which was originally cast in combinatorial terms. This reformulation allows us to expand the scope of the fortification method to new settings. First, we show any game (not just projection games) can be fortified, and give a simple proof of parallel repetition for general fortified games. Then, we prove parallel repetition and fortification theorems for games with players sharing quantum entanglement, as well as games with more than two players. This gives a new gap amplification method for general games in the quantum and multiplayer settings, which has recently received much interest. An important component of our work is a variant of the fortification transformation, called ""ordered fortification"", that preserves the entangled value of a game. The original fortification of Moshkovitz does not in general preserve the entangled value of a game, and this was a barrier to extending the fortification framework to the quantum setting."

Central to quantum algorithms are small angle rotations, which can be fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an unconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation routine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on the work of Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A, 91, 042315 (2015)] by compressing their circuit. Additionally, we present a method of diluting magic states that reduces costs associated with very small angle rotations. We quantify performance by the expected number of noisy magic states consumed per rotation, and compare with other protocols. For modest size angles, our protocols offer a factor 24 improvement over the best known gate synthesis protocols and a factor 2 over the Duclos-Cianci and Poulin protocol. For very small angle rotations, the dilution protocol dramatically reduces costs, giving several orders magnitude improvement over competitors. There also exists an intermediary regime of small, but not very small, angles where our approach gives a marginal improvement over gate synthesis. We discuss how different performance metrics may alter these conclusions."

The phase function describes symmetries of the resource state of the MBQC, specifies the computational output, and acts as a contextuality witness. It is also a topological object, namely a 1-cochain in group cohomology. Non-exactness of the cochain reveals the presence of contextuality, and is a precondition for quantum speedup."

While the result is not completely tight, leaving some gap between the region of error and privacy parameters for which the converse bound holds, and a larger no-go region, it represents a further step towards an understanding of strong converses of wiretap channels [cf.

573,1512.05903,2015,2,15,21,Quantum algorithms and the finite element method,Ashley Montanaro;Sam Pallister,"The finite element method is used to approximately solve boundary value problems for differential equations. The method discretises the parameter space and finds an approximate solution by solving a large system of linear equations. Here we investigate the extent to which the finite element method can be accelerated using an efficient quantum algorithm for solving linear equations. We consider the representative general question of approximately computing a linear functional of the solution to a boundary value problem, and compare the quantum algorithm's theoretical performance with that of a standard classical algorithm -- the conjugate gradient method. Prior work had claimed that the quantum algorithm could be exponentially faster, but did not determine the overall classical and quantum runtimes required to achieve a predetermined solution accuracy. Taking this into account, we find that the quantum algorithm can achieve a polynomial speedup, the extent of which grows with the dimension of the partial differential equation. In addition, we give evidence that no improvement of the quantum algorithm could lead to a super-polynomial speedup when the dimension is fixed and the solution satisfies certain smoothness properties."
574,1511.04385,2015,1,26,21,Factoring Safe Semiprimes with a Single Quantum Query,Frédéric Grosshans;Thomas Lawson;François Morain;Benjamin Smith,"Shor's factoring algorithm (SFA), by its ability to efficiently factor large numbers, has the potential to undermine contemporary encryption. At its heart is a process called order finding, which quantum mechanics lets us perform efficiently. SFA thus consists of a quantum order finding algorithm (QOFA), bookended by classical routines which, given the order, return the factors. But, with probability up to $1/2$, these classical routines fail, and QOFA must be rerun. We modify these routines using elementary results in number theory, improving the likelihood that they return the factors. We present a new quantum factoring algorithm based on QOFA which is better than SFA at factoring safe semiprimes, an important class of numbers used in RSA encryption (and reputed to be the hardest to factor). With just one call to QOFA, our algorithm almost always factors safe semiprimes. As well as a speed-up, improving efficiency gives our algorithm other, practical advantages: unlike SFA, it does not need a randomly picked input, making it simpler to construct in the lab; and in the (unlikely) case of failure, the same circuit can be rerun, without modification. We consider generalising this result to other cases, although we do not find a simple extension, and conclude that SFA is still the best algorithm for general numbers (non safe semiprimes, in other words). Even so, we present some simple number theoretic tricks for improving SFA in this case."
575,1511.03730,2015,12,21,21,A deterministic polynomial time algorithm for non-commutative rational identity testing with applications,Ankit Garg;Leonid Gurvits;Rafael Oliveira;Avi Wigderson,"In this paper we present a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for testing if a symbolic matrix in non-commuting variables over $\mathbb{Q}$ is invertible or not. The analogous question for commuting variables is the celebrated polynomial identity testing (PIT) for symbolic determinants. In contrast to the commutative case, which has an efficient probabilistic algorithm, the best previous algorithm for the non-commutative setting required exponential time (whether or not randomization is allowed). The algorithm efficiently solves the ""word problem"" for the free skew field, and the identity testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting variables, two problems which had only exponential-time algorithms prior to this work. The main contribution of this paper is a complexity analysis of an existing algorithm due to Gurvits, who proved it was polynomial time for certain classes of inputs. We prove it always runs in polynomial time. The main component of our analysis is a simple (given the necessary known tools) lower bound on central notion of capacity of operators (introduced by Gurvits). We extend the algorithm to actually approximate capacity to any accuracy in polynomial time, and use this analysis to give quantitative bounds on the continuity of capacity (the later is used in a subsequent paper on Brascamp-Lieb inequalities). Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and algorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and motivations. They arise independently in (commutative) invariant theory and representation theory, linear algebra, optimization, linear system theory, quantum information theory, approximation of the permanent and naturally in non-commutative algebra. We provide a detailed account of some of these sources and their interconnections."
576,1511.03675,2015,11,16,21,Membership in moment polytopes is in NP and coNP,Peter Bürgisser;Matthias Christandl;Ketan D Mulmuley;Michael Walter,"We show that the problem of deciding membership in the moment polytope associated with a finite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact, connected Lie group is in NP and coNP. This is the first non-trivial result on the computational complexity of this problem, which naively amounts to a quadratically-constrained program. Our result applies in particular to the Kronecker polytopes, and therefore to the problem of deciding positivity of the stretched Kronecker coefficients. In contrast, it has recently been shown that deciding positivity of a single Kronecker coefficient is NP-hard in general [Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley and Walter, arXiv:1507.02955]. We discuss the consequences of our work in the context of complexity theory and the quantum marginal problem."

For our analysis we consider an entanglement-based protocol based on BBM92 as well as a prepare-and-measure protocol based on BB84. Our presentation differs from previous work in that we are careful to model all the randomness that is used throughout the protocol and take care of all the transcripts of the communication over the public channel. We hope that this work will be a good starting point for readers interested in finite key analysis of protocols in quantum cryptography."

We prove that the set of primitive CP maps of fixed Kraus rank is path-connected and we provide a complete classification of the connected components of irreducible CP maps at given Kraus rank and fixed peripheral spectrum in terms of a multiplicity index. These findings are then applied to analyse 1D quantum phases by studying equivalence classes of translational invariant Matrix Product States that correspond to the connected components of the respective CP maps. Our results extend the previously obtained picture in that they do not require blocking of physical sites, they lead to analytic paths and they allow to decompose into ergodic components and to study the breaking of translational symmetry."
579,1505.01265,2015,9,7,21,A new property of the Lovász number and duality relations between graph parameters,Antonio Acín;Runyao Duan;David E Roberson;Ana Belén Sainz;Andreas Winter,"We show that for any graph $G$, by considering ""activation"" through the strong product with another graph $H$, the relation $\alpha(G) \leq \vartheta(G)$ between the independence number and the Lovász number of $G$ can be made arbitrarily tight: Precisely, the inequality \[ \alpha(G \times H) ≤\vartheta(G \times H) = \vartheta(G)\,\vartheta(H) \]becomes asymptotically an equality for a suitable sequence of ancillary graphs $H$. This motivates us to look for other products of graph parameters of $G$ and $H$ on the right hand side of the above relation. For instance, a result of Rosenfeld and Hales states that \[ \alpha(G \times H) ≤\alpha^*(G)\,\alpha(H), \]with the fractional packing number $\alpha^*(G)$, and for every $G$ there exists $H$ that makes the above an equality; conversely, for every graph $H$ there is a $G$ that attains equality. These findings constitute some sort of duality of graph parameters, mediated through the independence number, under which $\alpha$ and $\alpha^*$ are dual to each other, and the Lovász number $\vartheta$ is self-dual. We also show duality of Schrijver's and Szegedy's variants $\vartheta^-$ and $\vartheta^+$ of the Lovász number, and explore analogous notions for the chromatic number under strong and disjunctive graph products."
580,1504.05307,2015,6,30,21,The effect of noise correlations on randomized benchmarking,Harrison Ball;Thomas M Stace;Steven T Flammia;Michael J Biercuk,"Among the most popular and well studied quantum characterization, verification and validation techniques is randomized benchmarking (RB), an important statistical tool used to characterize the performance of physical logic operations useful in quantum information processing. In this work we provide a detailed mathematical treatment of the effect of temporal noise correlations on the outcomes of RB protocols. We provide a fully analytic framework capturing the accumulation of error in RB expressed in terms of a three-dimensional random walk in ""Pauli space."" Using this framework we derive the probability density function describing RB outcomes (averaged over noise) for both Markovian and correlated errors, which we show is generally described by a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters depending on the correlation structure. Long temporal correlations impart large nonvanishing variance and skew in the distribution towards high-fidelity outcomes -- consistent with existing experimental data -- highlighting potential finite-sampling pitfalls and the divergence of the mean RB outcome from worst-case errors in the presence of noise correlations. We use the Filter-transfer function formalism to reveal the underlying reason for these differences in terms of effective coherent averaging of correlated errors in certain random sequences. We conclude by commenting on the impact of these calculations on the utility of single-metric approaches to quantum characterization, verification, and validation."

The basic concepts and useful tools underlying fault-tolerant quantum computation, such as universal quantum computation, stabilizer formalism, and measurement-based quantum computation, are also provided in a pedagogical way. Topological quantum computation by brading the defects on the surface code is explained in both circuit-based and measurement-based models in such a way that their relation is clear. The interdisciplinary connections between quantum error correction codes and subjects in other fields such as topological order in condensed matter physics and spin glass models in statistical physics are also discussed.

582,1503.00577,2015,5,7,21,Understanding nature from experimental observations: a theory independent test for gravitational decoherence,Corsin Pfister;Jędrzej Kaniewski;Marco Tomamichel;Atul Mantri;R Schmucker;N McMahon;G J Milburn;Stephanie Wehner,"Quantum mechanics and the theory of gravity are presently not compatible. A particular question is whether gravity causes decoherence - an unavoidable source of noise. Several models for gravitational decoherence have been proposed, not all of which can be described quantum mechanically. In parallel, several experiments have been proposed to test some of these models, where the data obtained by such experiments is analyzed assuming quantum mechanics. Since we may need to modify quantum mechanics to account for gravity, however, one may question the validity of using quantum mechanics as a calculational tool to draw conclusions from experiments concerning gravity. Here we propose an experiment to estimate gravitational decoherence whose conclusions hold even if quantum mechanics would need to be modified. We first establish a general information-theoretic notion of decoherence which reduces to the standard measure within quantum mechanics. Second, drawing on ideas from quantum information, we propose a very general experiment that allows us to obtain a quantitative estimate of decoherence of any physical process for any physical theory satisfying only very mild conditions.Finally, we propose a concrete experiment using optomechanics to estimate gravitational decoherence in any such theory, including quantum mechanics as a special case. Our work raises the interesting question whether other properties of nature could similarly be established from experimental observations alone - that is, without already having a rather well formed theory of nature like quantum mechanics to make sense of experimental data."
583,1502.03149,2015,4,22,21,The general structure of quantum resource theories,Fernando G S L Brandão;Gilad Gour,"In recent years it was recognized that properties of physical systems such as entanglement, athermality, and asymmetry, can be viewed as resources for important tasks in quantum information, thermodynamics, and other areas of physics. This recognition followed by the development of specific quantum resource theories (QRTs), such as entanglement theory, determining how quantum states that cannot be prepared under certain restrictions may be manipulated and used to circumvent the restrictions. Here we discuss the general structure of QRTs, and show that under a few assumptions (such as convexity of the set of free states), a QRT is asymptotically reversible if its set of allowed operations is maximal; that is, if the allowed operations are the set of all operations that do not generate (asymptotically) a resource. In this case, the asymptotic conversion rate is given in terms of the regularized relative entropy of a resource which is the unique measure/quantifier of the resource in the asymptotic limit of many copies of the state. This measure also equals the smoothed version of the logarithmic robustness of the resource."

We create a new model that allows multiple oracles with differing costs. This model captures more of the difficulty of certain natural problems. We test this model on a simple problem, Search with Two Oracles, for which we create a quantum algorithm that we prove is asymptotically optimal. We further give some evidence, using a geometric picture of Grover's algorithm, that our algorithm is exactly optimal."
585,1501.01715,2015,3,3,21,Hamiltonian simulation with nearly optimal dependence on all parameters,Dominic W Berry;Andrew M Childs;Robin Kothari,"We present an algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation whose complexity is optimal (up to log factors) as a function of all parameters of interest. Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product $\tau$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\tau$."
586,1411.1397,2014,2,12,21,"Strong parallel repetition for free entangled games, with any number of players",Kai-Min Chung;Xiaodi Wu;Henry Yuen,"We present a strong parallel repetition theorem for the entangled value of multi-player, one-round free games (games where the inputs come from a product distribution). Our result is the first parallel repetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players. Furthermore, our theorem applies to games where the players are allowed to output (possibly entangled) quantum states as answers. More specifically, let $G$ be a $k$-player free game, with entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \epsilon$. We show that the entangled value of the $n$-fold repetition of $G$, $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n})$, is at most $(1 - \epsilon)^{\Omega(n/k^2)}$. In the traditional setting of $k=2$ players, our parallel repetition theorem is optimal in terms of its dependence on $\epsilon$ and $n$. For an arbitrary number of players, our result is nearly optimal: for all $k$, we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n > 1$ such that $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n}) \geq \mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$. Hence, exponent of the repeated game value cannot be improved beyond $\Omega(n/k)$. Our parallel repetition theorem improves on the prior results of [Jain, et al. 2014] and [Chailloux, Scarpa 2014] in a number of ways: (1) our theorem applies to a larger class of games (arbitrary number of players, quantum outputs); (2) we demonstrate that strong parallel repetition holds for the entangled value of free games: i.e., the base of the repeated game value is $1 - \epsilon$, rather than $1 - \epsilon^2$; and (3) there is no dependence of the repeated game value on the input and output alphabets of $G$. In contrast, it is known that the repeated game value of classical free games must depend on the output size. Thus our results demonstrate a seperation between the behavior of entangled games and classical games."
587,1411.0729,2014,2,10,21,The Private and Public Correlation Cost of Three Random Variables with Collaboration,Eric Chitambar;Min-Hsiu Hsieh;Andreas Winter,"In this paper we consider the problem of generating arbitrary three-party correlations from a combination of public and secret correlations. Two parties -- called Alice and Bob -- share perfectly correlated bits that are secret from a collaborating third party, Charlie. At the same time, all three parties have access to a separate source of correlated bits, and their goal is to convert these two resources into multiple copies of some given tripartite distribution $P_{XYZ}$. We obtain a single-letter characterization of the trade-off between public and private bits that are needed to achieve this task. The rate of private bits is shown to generalize Wyner's classic notion of common information held between a pair of random variables. The problem we consider is also closely related to the task of secrecy formation in which $P_{XYZ}$ is generated using public communication and local randomness but with Charlie functioning as an adversary instead of a collaborator. We describe in detail the differences between the collaborative and adversarial scenarios."
588,1410.1540,2014,1,9,21,The Information Theoretic Interpretation of the Length of a Curve,Bartlomiej Czech;Patrick Hayden;Nima Lashkari;Brian Swingle,"In the context of holographic duality with AdS3 asymptotics, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula states that the entanglement entropy of a subregion is given by the length of a certain bulk geodesic. The entanglement entropy can be operationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the state of the subregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a reference party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other bulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information theoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing that the length of more general bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce a new task called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary subregion must be transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale in a way determined by the geometry of the bulk curve. Our main result is that the cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions of constrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the signed length of the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative, constrained state merging distills entanglement rather than consuming it. This demonstration has two parts: first, we exhibit a protocol whose cost is the length of the curve and second, we prove that this protocol is optimal in that it uses the minimum amount of entanglement. In order to complete the proof, we additionally demonstrate that single-shot smooth conditional entropies for intervals in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories with large central charge are well approximated by their von Neumann counterparts. We also revisit the relationship between the differential entropy and the maximum entropy among locally consistent density operators, demonstrating large quantitative discrepancy between the two quantities in conformal field theories."

Making use of perturbation gadget techniques, we define a perturbative Hamiltonian acting on the virtual PEPS space with a finite order low energy effective Hamiltonian that is a gapped, frustration-free parent Hamiltonian for an encoded version of a desired PEPS. For topologically ordered PEPS, the ground space of the low energy effective Hamiltonian is shown to be in the same phase as the desired state to all orders of perturbation theory. An encoded parent Hamiltonian for the double semion string net ground state is explicitly constructed as a concrete example."

Covered topics include generalized and least square measurements, state discrimination, quantum relative entropies, the Bures distance on the set of quantum states, the quantum Fisher information, the quantum Chernoff bound, bipartite entanglement, the quantum discord, and geometrical measures of quantum correlations.

With such a channel, a one-time pad can safely be reused many times as long as no eavesdrop is detected, and, planning ahead, part of the capacity of these uncompromised transmissions can be used to send fresh random bits with which to replace the one-time pad when an eavesdrop finally is detected. Unlike other schemes for stretching a one-time pad, this scheme does not depend on complexity-theoretic assumptions such as the difficulty of factoring."
592,1406.7142,2014,7,21,21,On the power of PPT-preserving and non-signalling codes,Debbie W Leung;William Matthews,"We derive one-shot upper bounds for quantum noisy channel codes. We do so by regarding a channel code as a bipartite operation with an encoder belonging to the sender and a decoder belonging to the receiver, and imposing constraints on the bipartite operation. We investigate the power of codes whose bipartite operation is non-signalling from Alice to Bob, positive-partial transpose (PPT) preserving, or both, and derive a simple semidefinite program for the achievable entanglement fidelity. Using the semidefinite program, we show that the non-signalling assisted quantum capacity for memoryless channels is equal to the entanglement-assisted capacity. We also relate our PPT-preserving codes and the PPT-preserving entanglement distillation protocols studied by Rains. Applying these results to a concrete example, the 3-dimensional Werner-Holevo channel, we find that codes that are non-signalling and PPT-preserving can be strictly less powerful than codes satisfying either one of the constraints, and therefore provide a tighter bound for unassisted codes. Furthermore, PPT-preserving non-signalling codes can send one qubit perfectly over two uses of the channel, which has no quantum capacity. We discuss whether this can be interpreted as a form of superactivation of quantum capacity."
593,1406.6932,2014,7,15,21,Computational quantum-classical boundary of complex and noisy quantum systems,Keisuke Fujii;Shuhei Tamate,"It is often said that the transition from quantum to classical worlds is caused by decoherence originated from an interaction between a system of interest and its surrounding environment. Here we establish a computational quantum-classical boundary from the viewpoint of classical simulatability of a quantum system under decoherence. Specifically, we consider commuting quantum circuits being subject to decoherence. Or equivalently, we can regard them as measurement-based quantum computation on decohered weighted graph states. To show intractability of classical simulation above the boundary, we utilize the postselection argument introduced by M. J. Bremner, R. Jozsa, and D. J. Shepherd [Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Science 465, 1413 (2009).] and crucially strengthen its statement by taking noise effect into account. Classical simulatability below the boundary is also shown constructively by using both separable criteria in a projected-entangled-pair-state picture and the Gottesman-Knill theorem for mixed state Clifford circuits. We found that when each qubit is subject to a single-qubit complete-positive-trace-preserving noise, the computational quantum-classical boundary is sharply given by the noise rate required for the distillability of a magic state. The obtained quantum-classical boundary of noisy quantum dynamics reveals a complexity landscape of controlled quantum systems. This paves a way to an experimentally feasible verification of quantum mechanics in a high complexity limit beyond classically simulatable region."
594,1405.7552,2014,7,3,21,Adiabatic optimization without local minima,Michael Jarret;Stephen P Jordan,"Several previous works have investigated the circumstances under which quantum adiabatic optimization algorithms can tunnel out of local energy minima that trap simulated annealing or other classical local search algorithms. Here we investigate the even more basic question of whether adiabatic optimization algorithms always succeed in polynomial time for trivial optimization problems in which there are no local energy minima other than the global minimum. Surprisingly, we find a counterexample in which the potential is a single basin on a graph, but the eigenvalue gap is exponentially small as a function of the number of vertices. In this counterexample, the ground state wavefunction consists of two ""lobes"" separated by a region of exponentially small amplitude. Conversely, we prove if the ground state wavefunction is single-peaked then the eigenvalue gap scales at worst as one over the square of the number of vertices."
595,1404.5275,2014,6,30,21,Accelerated Randomized Benchmarking,Christopher E Granade;Christopher Ferrie;David G Cory,"Quantum information processing offers promising advances for a wide range of fields and applications, provided that we can efficiently assess the performance of the control applied in candidate systems. That is, we must be able to determine whether we have implemented a desired gate, and refine accordingly. Randomized benchmarking reduces the difficulty of this task by exploiting symmetries in quantum operations. Here, we bound the resources required for benchmarking and show that, with prior information, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy than in traditional approaches to benchmarking. Moreover, by building on state-of-the-art classical algorithms, we reach these accuracies with near-optimal resources. Our approach requires an order of magnitude less data to achieve the same accuracies and to provide online estimates of the errors in the reported fidelities. We also show that our approach is useful for physical devices by comparing to simulations. Our results thus enable the application of randomized benchmarking in new regimes, and dramatically reduce the experimental effort required to assess control fidelities in quantum systems. Finally, our work is based on open-source scientific libraries, and can readily be applied in systems of interest."
596,1404.1366,2014,6,27,21,New one shot quantum protocols with application to communication complexity,Anurag Anshu;Rahul Jain;Priyanka Mukhopadhyay;Ala Shayeghi;Penghui Yao,"In this paper we present the following quantum compression protocol: P : Let $\rho,\sigma$ be quantum states such that $S(\rho || \sigma) = \text{Tr} (\rho \log \rho - \rho \log \sigma)$, the relative entropy between $\rho$ and $\sigma$, is finite. Alice gets to know the eigen-decomposition of $\rho$. Bob gets to know the eigen-decomposition of $\sigma$. Both Alice and Bob know $S(\rho || \sigma)$ and an error parameter $\epsilon$. Alice and Bob use shared entanglement and after communication of $\mathcal{O}((S(\rho || \sigma)+1)/\epsilon^4)$ bits from Alice to Bob, Bob ends up with a quantum state $\tilde{\rho}$ such that $F(\rho, \tilde{\rho}) \geq 1 - 5\epsilon$, where $F(\cdot)$ represents fidelity. This result can be considered as a non-commutative generalization of a result due to Braverman and Rao [2011] where they considered the special case when $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are classical probability distributions (or commute with each other) and use shared randomness instead of shared entanglement. We use P to obtain an alternate proof of a direct-sum result for entanglement assisted quantum one-way communication complexity for all relations, which was first shown by Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [2005,2008]. We also present a variant of protocol P in which Bob has some side information about the state with Alice. We show that in such a case, the amount of communication can be further reduced, based on the side information that Bob has. Our second result provides a quantum analogue of the widely used classical correlated-sampling protocol. For example, Holenstein [2007] used the classical correlated-sampling protocol in his proof of a parallel-repetition theorem for two-player one-round games."
597,1403.2402,2014,5,30,21,Graph states as ground states of two-body frustration-free Hamiltonians,Andrew S Darmawan;Stephen D Bartlett,"The framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) allows us to view the ground states of local Hamiltonians as potential resources for universal quantum computation. A central goal in this field is to find models with ground states that are universal for MBQC and that are also natural in the sense that they involve only two-body interactions and have a small local Hilbert space dimension. Graph states are the original resource states for MBQC, and while it is not possible to obtain graph states as exact ground states of two-body Hamiltonians here we construct two-body frustration-free Hamiltonians that have arbitrarily good approximations of graph states as unique ground states. The construction involves taking a two-body frustration-free model that has a ground state convertible to a graph state with stochastic local operations, then deforming the model such that its ground state is close to a graph state. Each graph state qubit resides in a subspace of a higher dimensional particle. This deformation can be applied to two-body frustration-free Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models, yielding Hamiltonians that are exactly solvable with exact tensor network expressions for ground states. For the star-lattice AKLT model, the ground state of which is not expected to be a universal resource for MBQC, applying such a deformation appears to enhance the computational power of the ground state, promoting it to a universal resource for MBQC. Transitions in computational power, similar to percolation phase transitions, can be observed when Hamiltonians are deformed in this way. Improving the fidelity of the ground state comes at the cost of a shrinking gap. While analytically proving gap properties for these types of models is difficult in general, we provide a detailed analysis of the deformation of a spin-1 AKLT state to a linear graph state."
598,1312.0036,2013,4,22,21,Weak Parity,Scott Aaronson;Andris Ambainis;Kaspars Balodis;Mohammad Bavarian,"We study the query complexity of Weak Parity: the problem of computing the parity of an n-bit input string, where one only has to succeed on a 1/2+eps fraction of input strings, but must do so with high probability on those inputs where one does succeed. It is well-known that n randomized queries and n/2 quantum queries are needed to compute parity on all inputs. But surprisingly, we give a randomized algorithm for Weak Parity that makes only O(n/log^0.246(1/eps)) queries, as well as a quantum algorithm that makes only O(n/sqrt(log(1/eps))) queries. We also prove a lower bound of Omega(n/log(1/eps)) in both cases; and using extremal combinatorics, prove lower bounds of Omega(log n) in the randomized case and Omega(sqrt(log n)) in the quantum case for any eps>0. We show that improving our lower bounds is intimately related to two longstanding open problems about Boolean functions: the Sensitivity Conjecture, and the relationships between query complexity and polynomial degree."
599,1311.1851,2013,4,7,21,Quantum Algorithms for Approximating the Effective Resistances in Electrical Networks,Guoming Wang,"The theory of electrical network has many applications in algorithm design and analysis. It is an important task to compute the basic quantities about electrical networks, such as electrical flows and effective resistances, as quickly as possible. Classically, to compute these quantities, one basically need to solve a Laplacian linear system, and the best known algorithms take $\tilde{O}(m)$ time, where $m$ is the number of edges. In this paper, we present two quantum algorithms for approximating the effective resistance between any two vertices in an electrical network. Both of them have time complexity polynomial in $\log{n}$, $d$, $c$, $1/\phi$ and $1/\epsilon$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, $d$ is the maximum degree of the vertices, $c$ is the ratio of the largest to the smallest edge resistance, $\phi$ is the expansion of the network, and $\epsilon$ is the relative error. In particular, when $d$ and $c$ are small and $\phi$ is large, our algorithms run very fast. In contrast, it is unknown whether classical algorithms can solve this case very fast. Furthermore, we prove that the polynomial dependence on the inverse expansion (i.e. $1/\phi$) is necessary. As a consequence, our algorithms cannot be significantly improved. Finally, as a by-product, our second algorithm also produces a quantum state approximately proportional to the electrical flow between any two vertices, which might be of independent interest. Our algorithms are based on using quantum tools to analyze the algebraic properties of graph-related matrices. While one of them relies on inverting the Laplacian matrix, the other relies on projecting onto the kernel of the weighted incidence matrix. It is hopeful that more quantum algorithms can be developed in similar way."
600,1310.5664,2013,3,12,21,Quantum Locally Testable Codes,Dorit Aharonov;Lior Eldar,"We initiate the study of quantum Locally Testable Codes (qLTCs). We provide a definition together with a simplification, denoted sLTCs, for the special case of stabilizer codes, together with some basic results using those definitions. The most crucial parameter of such codes is their soundness, $R(\delta)$, namely, the probability that a randomly chosen constraint is violated as a function of the distance of a word from the code ($\delta$, the relative distance from the code, is called the proximity). We then proceed to study limitations on qLTCs. In our first main result we prove a surprising, inherently quantum, property of sLTCs: for small values of proximity, the better the small-set expansion of the interaction graph of the constraints, the less sound the qLTC becomes. This phenomenon, which can be attributed to monogamy of entanglement, stands in sharp contrast to the classical setting. The complementary, more intuitive, result also holds: an upper bound on the soundness when the code is defined on poor small-set expanders (a bound which turns out to be far more difficult to show in the quantum case). Together we arrive at a quantum upper-bound on the soundness of stabilizer qLTCs set on any graph, which does not hold in the classical case. Many open questions are raised regarding what possible parameters are achievable for qLTCs. In the appendix we also define a quantum analogue of PCPs of proximity (PCPPs) and point out that the result of Ben-Sasson et. al. by which PCPPs imply LTCs with related parameters, carries over to the sLTCs. This creates a first link between qLTCs and quantum PCPs."

The scaling of this bound as a function of the subsystem dimension on which the Hamiltonian acts nontrivially is optimal and is exponentially improved over previously known bounds. As an application, we show that a gapped quantum many-body spin system on an arbitrary lattice satisfies an area law for the entanglement entropy if and only if any other state with which it is adiabatically connected (i.e. any state in the same phase) also satisfies an area law."

A quantum annealer, in particular, solves hard optimisation problems by evolving a known initial configuration at non-zero temperature towards the ground state of a Hamiltonian encoding a given problem. Here, we present results from experiments on a 108 qubit D-Wave One device based on superconducting flux qubits. The strong correlations between the device and a simulated quantum annealer, in contrast with weak correlations between the device and classical annealing or classical spin dynamics, demonstrate that the device performs quantum annealing. We find additional evidence for quantum annealing in the form of small-gap avoided level crossings characterizing the hard problems. To assess the computational power of the device we compare it to optimised classical algorithms."

We present a pedagogical review of quantum phase estimation and simulate the algorithm to numerically determine its scaling in circuit depth and width. We show that the use of purely random measurements requires a number of measurements that is optimal up to constant factors, albeit at the cost of exponential classical post-processing; the method can also be used to improve classical signal processing. We then develop a quantum algorithm for phase estimation that yields an asymptotic improvement in runtime, coming within a factor of log* of the minimum number of measurements required while still requiring only minimal classical post-processing. The corresponding quantum circuit requires asymptotically lower depth and width (number of qubits) than quantum phase estimation."
604,1407.8183,2014,4,23,20,Adiabatic quantum optimization in presence of discrete noise: Reducing the problem dimensionality,Salvatore Mandrà;Gian Giacomo Guerreschi;Alán Aspuru-Guzik,"Adiabatic quantum optimization is a procedure to solve a vast class of optimization problems by slowly changing the Hamiltonian of a quantum system. The evolution time necessary for the algorithm to be successful scales inversely with the minimum energy gap encountered during the dynamics. Unfortunately, the direct calculation of the gap is strongly limited by the exponential growth in the dimensionality of the Hilbert space associated to the quantum system. Although many special-purpose methods have been devised to reduce the effective dimensionality, they are strongly limited to particular classes of problems with evident symmetries. Moreover, little is known about the computational power of adiabatic quantum optimizers in real-world conditions. Here, we propose and implement a general purposes reduction method that does not rely on any explicit symmetry and which requires, under certain general conditions, only a polynomial amount of classical resources. Thanks to this method, we are able to analyze the performance of ""non-ideal"" quantum adiabatic optimizers to solve the well-known Grover problem, namely the search of target entries in an unsorted database, in the presence of discrete local defects. In this case, we show that adiabatic quantum optimization, even if affected by random noise, is still potentially faster than any classical algorithm."
605,1504.00020,2015,4,17,20,What is the probability of a thermodynamical transition?,Álvaro M Alhambra;Jonathan Oppenheim;Christopher Perry,"If the second law of thermodynamics forbids a transition from one state to another, then it is still possible to make the transition happen by using a sufficient amount of work. But if we do not have access to this amount of work, can the transition happen probabilistically? In the thermodynamic limit, this probability tends to zero, but here we find that for finite-sized systems, it can be finite. We compute the maximum probability of a transition or a thermodynamical fluctuation from any initial state to any final state, and show that this maximum can be achieved for any final state which is block-diagonal in the energy eigenbasis. We also find upper and lower bounds on this transition probability, in terms of the work of transition. As a bi-product, we introduce a finite set of thermodynamical monotones related to the thermo-majorization criteria which governs state transitions, and compute the work of transition in terms of them. The trade-off between the probability of a transition, and any partial work added to aid in that transition is also considered. Our results have applications in entanglement theory, and we find the amount of entanglement required (or gained) when transforming one pure entangled state into any other."
606,1209.0448,2012,4,3,20,A classical leash for a quantum system: Command of quantum systems via rigidity of CHSH games,Ben W Reichardt;Falk Unger;Umesh Vazirani,"Can a classical system command a general adversarial quantum system to realize arbitrary quantum dynamics? If so, then we could realize the dream of device-independent quantum cryptography: using untrusted quantum devices to establish a shared random key, with security based on the correctness of quantum mechanics. It would also allow for testing whether a claimed quantum computer is truly quantum. Here we report a technique by which a classical system can certify the joint, entangled state of a bipartite quantum system, as well as command the application of specific operators on each subsystem. This is accomplished by showing a strong converse to Tsirelson's optimality result for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game: the only way to win many games is if the bipartite state is close to the tensor product of EPR states, and the measurements are the optimal CHSH measurements on successive qubits. This leads directly to a scheme for device-independent quantum key distribution. Control over the state and operators can also be leveraged to create more elaborate protocols for realizing general quantum circuits, and to establish that QMIP = MIP*."
607,1612.00034,2016,8,1,20,Efficient quantum tomography II,Ryan O'Donnell;John Wright,"Following [OW16], we continue our analysis of: (1) ""Quantum tomography"", i.e., learning a quantum state, i.e., the quantum generalization of learning a discrete probability distribution; (2) The distribution of Young diagrams output by the RSK algorithm on random words. Regarding (2), we introduce two powerful new tools: (i) A precise upper bound on the expected length of the longest union of $k$ disjoint increasing subsequences in a random length-$n$ word with letter distribution $\alpha_1 \geq \alpha_2 \geq \cdots \geq \alpha_d$; (ii) A new majorization property of the RSK algorithm that allows one to analyze the Young diagram formed by the lower rows $\lambda_k, \lambda_{k+1}, \dots$ of its output. These tools allow us to prove several new theorems concerning the distribution of random Young diagrams in the nonasymptotic regime, giving concrete error bounds that are optimal, or nearly so, in all parameters. As one example, we give a fundamentally new proof of the fact that the expected length of the longest increasing sequence in a random length-$n$ permutation is bounded by $2\sqrt{n}$. This is the $k = 1$, $\alpha_i \equiv \frac1d$, $d \to \infty$ special case of a much more general result we prove: the expected length of the $k$th Young diagram row produced by an $\alpha$-random word is $\alpha_k n \pm 2\sqrt{\alpha_kd n}$. From our new analyses of random Young diagrams we derive several new results in quantum tomography, including: (i) Learning the eigenvalues of an unknown state to $\epsilon$-accuracy in Hellinger-squared, chi-squared, or KL distance, using $n = O(d^2/\epsilon)$ copies; (ii) Learning the optimal rank-$k$ approximation of an unknown state to $\epsilon$-fidelity (Hellinger-squared distance) using $n = \widetilde{O}(kd/\epsilon)$ copies."

The idea is to add an extra step to the previously known algorithm which implements an operator that corrects the weightings of the Taylor series. This way, the desired accuracy is achieved with an improvement in the overall complexity of the algorithm. This quantum simulation method is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians of interest, including to quantum chemistry problems."

Quantum contextuality has been recently shown to be a resource for quantum computation with magic states for odd-prime dimensional qudits and two-dimensional systems with real wavefunctions.The phenomenon of state-independent contextuality poses a priori an obstruction to characterizing the case of regular qubits, the fundamental building block of quantum computation. Here, we establish contextuality of magic states as a necessary resource for a large class of quantum computation schemes on qubits. We illustrate our result with a concrete scheme related to measurement-based quantum computation."
610,1610.07849,2016,4,28,20,Fermionic Matrix Product States and One-Dimensional Topological Phases,Nick Bultinck;Dominic J Williamson;Jutho Haegeman;Frank Verstraete,"We develop the formalism of fermionic matrix product states (fMPS) and show how irreducible fMPS fall in two different classes, related to the different types of simple $\mathbb{Z}_2$ graded algebras, which are physically distinguished by the absence or presence of Majorana edge modes. The local structure of fMPS with Majorana edge modes also implies that there is always a two-fold degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum. Using the fMPS formalism we make explicit the correspondence between the $\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of time-reversal invariant spinless superconductors and the modulo 8 periodicity in the representation theory of real Clifford algebras. Studying fMPS with general on-site unitary and anti-unitary symmetries allows us to define invariants that label symmetry-protected phases of interacting fermions. The behavior of these invariants under stacking of fMPS is derived, which reveals the group structure of such interacting phases.We also consider spatial symmetries and show how the invariant phase factor in the partition function of reflection symmetric phases on an unorientable manifold appears in the fMPS framework."

We discuss the tensor representations of the $q$-qubit Clifford group, which is defined as the normalizer of the $q$-qubit Pauli group in $U(2^q)$. In particular, we characterize all irreducible subrepresentations of the two-copy representation $\varphi^{\otimes2}$ of the Clifford group on the matrix space $\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ with $d=2^q$. In an upcoming companion paper we applied this result to cut down the number of samples necessary to perform randomised benchmarking, a method for characterising quantum systems."

613,1609.05011,2016,12,1,20,Convex separation from convex optimization for large-scale problems,Stephen Brierley;Miguel Navascués;Tamas Vértesi,"We present a scheme, based on Gilbert's algorithm for quadratic minimization [SIAM J. Contrl., vol. 4, pp. 61-80, 1966], to prove separation between a point and an arbitrary convex set $S\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ via calls to an oracle able to perform linear optimizations over $S$. Compared to other methods, our scheme has almost negligible memory requirements and the number of calls to the optimization oracle does not depend on the dimensionality $n$ of the underlying space. We study the speed of convergence of the scheme under different promises on the shape of the set $S$ and/or the location of the point, validating the accuracy of our theoretical bounds with numerical examples. Finally, we present some applications of the scheme in quantum information theory. There we find that our algorithm out-performs existing linear programming methods for certain large scale problems, allowing us to certify nonlocality in bipartite scenarios with upto $42$ measurement settings. We apply the algorithm to upper bound the visibility of two-qubit Werner states, hence improving known lower bounds on Grothendieck's constant $K_G(3)$. Similarly, we compute new upper bounds on the visibility of GHZ states and on the steerability limit of Werner states for a fixed number of measurement settings."
614,1609.01652,2016,9,28,20,Entanglement of approximate quantum strategies in XOR games,Dimiter Ostrev;Thomas Vidick,"We show that for any $\varepsilon>0$ there is an XOR game $G=G(\varepsilon)$ with $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1/5})$ inputs for one player and $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2/5})$ inputs for the other player such that $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-1/5})$ ebits are required for any strategy achieving bias that is at least a multiplicative factor $(1-\varepsilon)$ from optimal. This gives an exponential improvement in both the number of inputs or outputs and the noise tolerance of any previously-known self-test for highly entangled states. Up to the exponent $-1/5$ the scaling of our bound with $\varepsilon$ is tight: for any XOR game there is an $\varepsilon$-optimal strategy using $\lceil \varepsilon^{-1} \rceil$ ebits, irrespective of the number of questions in the game."
615,1608.05317,2016,9,19,20,Rényi divergences as weighted non-commutative vector valued $L_p$-spaces,Mario Berta;Volkher B Scholz;Marco Tomamichel,"We show that Araki and Masuda's weighted non-commutative vector valued $L_p$-spaces [Araki & Masuda, Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci., 18:339 (1982)] correspond to an algebraic generalization of the sandwiched Rényi divergences with parameter $\alpha = \frac{p}{2}$. Using complex interpolation theory, we prove various fundamental properties of these divergences in the setup of von Neumann algebras, including a data processing inequality and monotonicity in $\alpha$. We thereby also give new proofs for the corresponding finite-dimensional properties. We discuss the limiting cases $\alpha\to \{\frac{1}{2},1,\infty\}$ leading to minus the logarithm of Uhlmann's fidelity, Umegaki's relative entropy, and the max-relative entropy, respectively. As a contribution that might be of independent interest, we derive a Riesz-Thorin theorem for Araki-Masuda $L_p$-spaces and an Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality for states on von Neumann algebras."
616,1605.08053,2016,9,19,20,Randomized benchmarking in measurement-based quantum computing,Rafael N Alexander;Peter S Turner;Stephen D Bartlett,"Randomized benchmarking is routinely used as an efficient method for characterizing the performance of sets of elementary logic gates in small quantum devices. In the measurement-based model of quantum computation, logic gates are implemented via single-site measurements on a fixed universal resource state. Here we adapt the randomized benchmarking protocol for a single qubit to a linear cluster state computation, which provides partial, yet efficient characterization of the noise associated with the target gate set. Applying randomized benchmarking to measurement-based quantum computation exhibits an interesting interplay between the inherent randomness associated with logic gates in the measurement-based model and the random gate sequences used in benchmarking. We consider two different approaches: the first makes use of the standard single-qubit Clifford group, while the second uses recently introduced (non-Clifford) measurement-based 2-designs, which harness inherent randomness to implement gate sequences."
617,1605.04315,2016,9,7,20,Kitaev honeycomb tensor networks: exact unitary circuits and applications,Philipp Schmoll;Roman Orus,"The Kitaev honeycomb model is a paradigm of exactly-solvable models, showing non-trivial physical properties such as topological quantum order, abelian and non-abelian anyons, and chirality. Its solution is one of the most beautiful examples of the interplay of different mathematical techniques in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we show how to derive a tensor network (TN) description of the eigenstates of this spin-1/2 model in the thermodynamic limit, and in particular for its ground state. In our setting, eigenstates are naturally encoded by an exact 3d TN structure made of fermionic unitary operators, corresponding to the unitary quantum circuit building up the many-body quantum state. In our derivation we review how the different ""solution ingredients"" of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be accounted for in the TN language, namely: Jordan-Wigner transformation, braidings of Majorana modes, fermionic Fourier transformation, and Bogoliubov transformation. The TN built in this way allows for a clear understanding of several properties of the model. In particular, we show how the fidelity diagram is straightforward both at zero temperature and at finite temperature in the vortex-free sector. We also show how the properties of two-point correlation functions follow easily. Finally, we also discuss the pros and cons of contracting of our 3d TN down to a 2d Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) with finite bond dimension. The results in this paper can be extended to generalizations of the Kitaev model, e.g., to other lattices, spins, and dimensions."
618,1605.02294,2016,8,19,20,Parallel distinguishability of quantum operations,Runyao Duan;Cheng Guo;Chi-Kwong Li;Yinan Li,"We find that the perfect distinguishability of two quantum operations by a parallel scheme depends only on an operator subspace generated from their Choi-Kraus operators. We further show that any operator subspace can be obtained from two quantum operations in such a way. This connection enables us to study the parallel distinguishability of operator subspaces directly without explicitly referring to the underlining quantum operations. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the parallel distinguishability of an operator subspace that is either one-dimensional or Hermitian. In both cases the condition is equivalent to the non-existence of positive definite operator in the subspace, and an optimal discrimination protocol is obtained. Finally, we provide more examples to show that the non-existence of positive definite operator is sufficient for many other cases, but in general it is only a necessary condition."

We show that the resulting code has a circuit-based noise threshold of $\sim 0.41\%$ (compared to $\sim 0.6\%$ for the toric code in a similar scenario), which is higher than any known 2D color code. We believe that the construction may be of interest for hardware in which one wants to use both long-range two-qubit gates as well as short-range gates between small clusters of qubits."

Building on the framework of Broadbent and Jeffery and recent results in the area of instantaneous non-local quantum computation, we show how to construct quantum gadgets that allow perfect correction of the errors which occur during the homomorphic evaluation of T gates on encrypted quantum data. Our scheme can be based on any classical (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme and requires no computational assumptions besides those already used by the classical scheme. The size of our quantum gadget depends on the space complexity of the classical decryption function -- which aligns well with the current efforts to minimize the complexity of the decryption function. Our scheme (or slight variants of it) offers a number of additional advantages such as ideal compactness, the ability to supply gadgets ""on demand"", circuit privacy for the evaluator against passive adversaries, and a three-round scheme for blind delegated quantum computation which puts only very limited demands on the quantum abilities of the client."
621,1603.00903,2016,5,27,20,Pointer Quantum PCPs and Multi-Prover Games,Alex B Grilo;Iordanis Kerenidis;Attila Pereszlényi,"The quantum PCP (QPCP) conjecture states that all problems in QMA, the quantum analogue of NP, admit quantum verifiers that only act on a constant number of qubits of a polynomial size quantum proof and have a constant gap between completeness and soundness. Despite an impressive body of work trying to prove or disprove the quantum PCP conjecture, it still remains widely open. The above-mentioned proof verification statement has also been shown equivalent to the QMA-completeness of the Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap. Nevertheless, unlike in the classical case, no equivalent formulation in the language of multi-prover games is known. In this work, we propose a new type of quantum proof systems, the Pointer QPCP, where a verifier first accesses a classical proof that he can use as a pointer to which qubits from the quantum part of the proof to access. We define the Pointer QPCP conjecture, that states that all problems in QMA admit quantum verifiers that first access a logarithmic number of bits from the classical part of a polynomial size proof, then act on a constant number of qubits from the quantum part of the proof, and have a constant gap between completeness and soundness. We define a new QMA-complete problem, the Set Local Hamiltonian problem, and a new restricted class of quantum multi-prover games, called CRESP games. We use them to provide two other equivalent statements to the Pointer QPCP conjecture: the Set Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap is QMA-complete; and the approximation of the maximum acceptance probability of CRESP games up to a constant additive factor is as hard as QMA. This is the first equivalence between a quantum PCP statement and the inapproximability of quantum multi-prover games."

However, interactions beyond two-body are difficult to realize experimentally. Perturbative gadgets were introduced to obtain arbitrary many-body effective interactions using Hamiltonians with two-body interactions only. Although valid for arbitrary $k$-body interactions, their use is limited to small $k$ because the strength of interaction is $k$'th order in perturbation theory. In this paper we develop a nonperturbative technique for obtaining effective $k$-body interactions using Hamiltonians consisting of at most $l$-body interactions with $l<k$. This technique works best for Hamiltonians with a few interactions with very large $k$ and can be used together with perturbative gadgets to embed Hamiltonians of considerable complexity in proper subspaces of two-local Hamiltonians. We describe how our technique can be implemented in a hybrid (gate-based and adiabatic) as well as solely adiabatic quantum computing scheme."

We have made the concept of the energy barrier therein mathematically well-defined, it is related to the minimum energy cost the environment has to provide to the system in order to produce a generalized Pauli error, maximized for any generalized Pauli errors, not only logical operators. We evaluate this generalized energy barrier in Abelian quantum double models and find it to be a constant independent of system size. Thus, we rule out the possibility of entropic protection for this broad group of models."

The main novelty of our protocol is that the gap between completeness and soundness is directly proportional to the promise gap on the (normalized) ground state energy of the Hamiltonian. This result can be interpreted as a concrete step towards a quantum PCP theorem giving entangled-prover interactive proof systems for QMA-complete problems. The key ingredient is a quantum version of the classical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld, where the function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is replaced by a pair of functions $\Xlin, \Zlin:\{0,1\}^n\to \text{Obs}_d(\C)$, the set of $d$-dimensional Hermitian matrices that square to identity. The test enforces that (i) each function is exactly linear, $\Xlin(a)\Xlin(b)=\Xlin(a+b)$ and $\Zlin(a) \Zlin(b)=\Zlin(a+b)$, and (ii) the two functions are approximately complementary, $\Xlin(a)\Zlin(b)\approx (-1)^{a\cdot b} \Zlin(b)\Xlin(a)$."
625,1512.01098,2015,4,1,20,Noise tailoring for scalable quantum computation via randomized compiling,Joel J Wallman;Joseph Emerson,"Quantum computers are poised to radically outperform their classical counterparts by manipulating coherent quantum systems. A realistic quantum computer will experience errors due to the environment and imperfect control. When these errors are even partially coherent, they present a major obstacle to achieving robust computation. Here, we propose a method for introducing independent random single-qubit gates into the logical circuit in such a way that the effective logical circuit remains unchanged. We prove that this randomization tailors the noise into stochastic Pauli errors, leading to dramatic reductions in worst-case and cumulative error rates, while introducing little or no experimental overhead. Moreover we prove that our technique is robust to variation in the errors over the gate sets and numerically illustrate the dramatic reductions in worst-case error that are achievable. Given such tailored noise, gates with significantly lower fidelity are sufficient to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, and, importantly, the worst case error rate of the tailored noise can be directly and efficiently measured through randomized benchmarking experiments. Remarkably, our method enables the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation under the error rates observed in recent experiments."

Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the butterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic definition of scrambling."

For any Boolean function there exists a span program that leads to a quantum algorithm with optimal quantum query complexity. In general, finding such span programs is not an easy task. In this work, given a query access to the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we provide two new span-program-based quantum algorithms: an algorithm for testing if the graph is bipartite that uses $O(n\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries; an algorithm for testing if the graph is connected that uses $O(n\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries."
628,1510.04805,2015,1,8,20,How many principles does it take to change a light bulb ... into a laser?,Howard M Wiseman,"Quantum optics did not, and could not, flourish without the laser. The present paper is not about the principles of laser construction, still less a history of how the laser was invented. Rather, it addresses the question: what are the fundamental features that distinguish laser light from thermal light? The obvious answer, ""laser light is coherent"", is, I argue, so vague that it must be put aside at the start, albeit to revisit later. A more specific, quantum theoretic, version, ""laser light is in a coherent state"", is simply wrong in this context: both laser light and thermal light can equally well be described by coherent states, with amplitudes that vary stochastically in space. Instead, my answer to the titular question is that four principles are needed: high directionality, monochromaticity, high brightness, and stable intensity. Combining the first three of these principles suffices to show, in a quantitative way --- involving, indeed, very large dimensionless quantities (up to $\sim10^{51}$) --- that a laser must be constructed very differently from a light bulb. This quantitative analysis is quite simple, and is easily relatable to ""coherence"", yet is not to be found in any text-books on quantum optics to my knowledge. The fourth principle is the most subtle and, perhaps surprisingly, is the only one related to coherent states in the quantum optics sense: it implies that the description in terms of coherent states is the only simple description of a laser beam. Interestingly, this leads to the (not, as it turns out, entirely new) prediction that narrowly filtered laser beams are indistinguishable from similarly filtered thermal beams. I hope that other educators find this material useful, it may contain surprises even for researchers who have been in the field longer than I have."

We first define a new method to efficiently approximate special unitary operators. Specifically, given a special unitary U and a precision \epsilon > 0, we show how to efficiently find a sequence of Clifford+V or Clifford+T operators whose product approximates U up to \epsilon in the operator norm. In the general case, the length of the approximating sequence is asymptotically optimal. If the unitary to approximate is diagonal then our method is optimal: it yields the shortest sequence approximating U up to \epsilon. Next, we introduce a mathematical formalization of a fragment of the Quipper quantum programming language. We define a typed lambda calculus called Proto-Quipper which formalizes a restricted but expressive fragment of Quipper. The type system of Proto-Quipper is based on intuitionistic linear logic and prohibits the duplication of quantum data, in accordance with the no-cloning property of quantum computation. We prove that Proto-Quipper is type-safe in the sense that it enjoys the subject reduction and progress properties."
630,1509.07789,2015,12,4,20,On exact counting and quasi-quantum complexity,Niel de Beaudrap,"We present characterisations of ""exact"" gap-definable classes, in terms of indeterministic models of computation which slightly modify the standard model of quantum computation. This follows on work of Aaronson [arXiv:quant-ph/0412187], who shows that the counting class PP can be characterised in terms of bounded-error ""quantum"" algorithms which use invertible (and possibly non-unitary) transformations, or postselections on events of non-zero probability. Our work considers similar modifications of the quantum computational model, but in the setting of exact algorithms, and algorithms with zero error and constant success probability. We show that the gap-definable counting classes [J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 48 (1994), p.116] which bound exact and zero-error quantum algorithms can be characterised in terms of ""quantum-like"" algorithms involving nonunitary gates, and that postselection and nonunitarity have equivalent power for exact quantum computation only if these classes collapse."
631,1509.07466,2015,11,13,20,Anchoring games for parallel repetition,Mohammad Bavarian;Thomas Vidick;Henry Yuen,"Two major open problems regarding the parallel repetition of games are whether an analogue of Raz's parallel-repetition theorem holds for (a) games with more than two players, and (b) games with quantum players using entanglement. We make progress on both problems: we introduce a class of games we call anchored, and prove exponential-decay parallel repetition theorems for anchored games in the multiplayer and entangled-player settings. We introduce a simple transformation on games called anchoring and show that this transformation turns any game into an anchored game. Together, our parallel repetition theorem and our anchoring transformation provide a simple and efficient hardness-amplification technique in both the classical multiplayer and quantum settings."

No initializations of qubits are allowed during the computation, nor intermediate measurements. The main results of this paper are unexpectedly strong error-reducible properties of such quantum computations. It is proved that any problem solvable by a polynomial-time quantum computation with one-sided bounded error that uses logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially small one-sided error using just two clean qubits, and with polynomially small one-sided error using just one clean qubit. It is further proved in the case of two-sided bounded error that any problem solvable by such a computation with a constant gap between completeness and soundness using logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially small two-sided error using just two clean qubits. If only one clean qubit is available, the problem is again still solvable with exponentially small error in one of the completeness and soundness and polynomially small error in the other. As an immediate consequence of the above result for the two-sided-error case, it follows that the TRACE ESTIMATION problem defined with fixed constant threshold parameters is complete for the classes of problems solvable by polynomial-time quantum computations with completeness 2/3 and soundness 1/3 using logarithmically many clean qubits and just one clean qubit. The techniques used for proving the error-reduction results may be of independent interest in themselves, and one of the technical tools can also be used to show the hardness of weak classical simulations of one-clean-qubit computations (i.e., DQC1 computations)."
633,1507.05676,2015,10,19,20,Double semions in arbitrary dimension,Michael H Freedman;Matthew B Hastings,"We present a generalization of the double semion topological quantum field theory to higher dimensions, as a theory of $d-1$ dimensional surfaces in a $d$ dimensional ambient space. We construct a local Hamiltonian which is a sum of commuting projectors and analyze the excitations and the ground state degeneracy. Defining a consistent set of local rules requires the sign structure of the ground state wavefunction to depend not just on the number of disconnected surfaces, but also upon their higher Betti numbers through the semicharacteristic. For odd $d$ the theory is related to the toric code by a local unitary transformation, but for even $d$ the dimension of the space of zero energy ground states is in general different from the toric code and for even $d>2$ it is also in general different from that of the twisted $Z_2$ Dijkgraaf-Witten model."
634,1507.00303,2015,10,9,20,Strengthened Monotonicity of Relative Entropy via Pinched Petz Recovery Map,David Sutter;Marco Tomamichel;Aram W Harrow,"The quantum relative entropy between two states satisfies a monotonicity property meaning that applying the same quantum channel to both states can never increase their relative entropy. It is known that this inequality is only tight when there is a ""recovery map"" that exactly reverses the effects of the quantum channel on both states. In this paper we strengthen this inequality by showing that the difference of relative entropies is bounded below by the measured relative entropy between the first state and a recovered state from its processed version. The recovery map is a convex combination of rotated Petz recovery maps and perfectly reverses the quantum channel on the second state. As a special case we reproduce recent lower bounds on the conditional mutual information such as the one proved in [Fawzi and Renner, Commun. Math. Phys., 2015]. Our proof only relies on elementary properties of pinching maps and the operator logarithm."
635,1506.00981,2015,9,28,20,Swiveled Rényi entropies,Frédéric Dupuis;Mark M Wilde,"This paper introduces ""swiveled Renyi entropies"" as an alternative to the Renyi entropic quantities put forward in [Berta et al., Phys. Rev. A 91, 022333 (2015)]. What distinguishes the swiveled Renyi entropies from the prior proposal of Berta et al. is that there is an extra degree of freedom: an optimization over unitary rotations with respect to particular fixed bases (swivels). A consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveled Renyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the Renyi family of entropies. The swiveled Renyi entropies are however generally discontinuous at $\alpha=1$ and do not converge to the von Neumann entropy-based measures in the limit as $\alpha\rightarrow1$, instead bounding them from above and below. Particular variants reduce to known Renyi entropies, such as the Renyi relative entropy or the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, but also lead to ordered Renyi conditional mutual informations and ordered Renyi generalizations of a relative entropy difference. Refinements of entropy inequalities such as monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as a consequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled Renyi entropies. Due to the lack of convergence at $\alpha=1$, it is unclear whether the swiveled Renyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, so that the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal."
636,1505.08042,2015,9,25,20,Random and free positive maps with applications to entanglement detection,Benoît Collins;Patrick Hayden;Ion Nechita,"We apply random matrix and free probability techniques to the study of linear maps of interest in quantum information theory. Random quantum channels have already been widely investigated with spectacular success. Here, we are interested in more general maps, asking only for $k$-positivity instead of the complete positivity required of quantum channels. Unlike the theory of completely positive maps, the theory of $k$-positive maps is far from being completely understood, and our techniques give many new parametrized families of such maps. We also establish a conceptual link with free probability theory, and show that our constructions can be obtained to some extent without random techniques in the setup of free products of von Neumann algebras. Finally, we study the properties of our examples and show that for some parameters, they are indecomposable. In particular, they can be used to detect the presence of entanglement missed by the partial transposition test, that is, PPT entanglement. As an application, we considerably refine our understanding of PPT states in the case where one of the spaces is large whereas the other one remains small."
637,1505.06686,2015,9,25,20,Demonstration of Robust Quantum Gate Tomography via Randomized Benchmarking,Blake R Johnson;Marcus P da Silva;Colm A Ryan;Shelby Kimmel;Jerry M Chow;Thomas A Ohki,"Typical quantum gate tomography protocols struggle with a self-consistency problem: the gate operation cannot be reconstructed without knowledge of the initial state and final measurement, but such knowledge cannot be obtained without well-characterized gates. A recently proposed technique, known as randomized benchmarking tomography (RBT), sidesteps this self-consistency problem by designing experiments to be insensitive to preparation and measurement imperfections. We implement this proposal in a superconducting qubit system, using a number of experimental improvements including implementing each of the elements of the Clifford group in single `atomic' pulses and custom control hardware to enable large overhead protocols. We show a robust reconstruction of several single-qubit quantum gates, including a unitary outside the Clifford group. We demonstrate that RBT yields physical gate reconstructions that are consistent with fidelities obtained by randomized benchmarking."
638,1505.02792,2015,7,22,20,Assumptions in Quantum Cryptography,Normand J Beaudry,"Quantum cryptography uses techniques and ideas from physics and computer science. The combination of these ideas makes the security proofs of quantum cryptography a complicated task. To prove that a quantum-cryptography protocol is secure, assumptions are made about the protocol and its devices. If these assumptions are not justified in an implementation then an eavesdropper may break the security of the protocol. Therefore, security is crucially dependent on which assumptions are made and how justified the assumptions are in an implementation of the protocol. This thesis is primarily a review that analyzes and clarifies the connection between the security proofs of quantum-cryptography protocols and their experimental implementations. In particular, we focus on quantum key distribution: the task of distributing a secret random key between two parties. We provide a comprehensive introduction to several concepts: quantum mechanics using the density operator formalism, quantum cryptography, and quantum key distribution. We define security for quantum key distribution and outline several mathematical techniques that can either be used to prove security or simplify security proofs. In addition, we analyze the assumptions made in quantum cryptography and how they may or may not be justified in implementations. Along with the review, we propose a framework that decomposes quantum-key-distribution protocols and their assumptions into several classes. Protocol classes can be used to clarify which proof techniques apply to which kinds of protocols. Assumption classes can be used to specify which assumptions are justified in implementations and which could be exploited by an eavesdropper. Two contributions of the author are discussed: the security proofs of two two-way quantum-key-distribution protocols and an intuitive proof of the data-processing inequality."
639,1505.02565,2015,7,2,20,Asynchronous reference frame agreement in a quantum network,Tanvirul Islam;Stephanie Wehner,"An efficient implementation of many multiparty protocols for quantum networks requires that all the nodes in the network share a common reference frame. Establishing such a reference frame from scratch is especially challenging in an asynchronous network where network links might have arbitrary delays and the nodes do not share synchronised clocks. In this work, we study the problem of establishing a common reference frame in an asynchronous network of $n$ nodes of which at most $t$ are affected by arbitrary unknown error, and the identities of the faulty nodes are not known. We present a protocol that allows all the correctly functioning nodes to agree on a common reference frame as long as the network graph is complete and not more than $t<n/4$ nodes are faulty. As the protocol is asynchronous, it can be used with some assumptions to synchronise clocks over a network. Also, the protocol has the appealing property that it allows any existing two-node asynchronous protocol for reference frame agreement to be lifted to a robust protocol for an asynchronous quantum network."

Here we experimentally demonstrate the longstanding goal of a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is sufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of that circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15 Mach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated into a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for arbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons and their measurement with a 12 single-photon detector system. We programmed this system to implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with verification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100 Haar random unitaries with average fidelity 0.999 $\pm$ 0.001. Our system is capable of switching between these and any other linear optical protocol in seconds. These results point the way to applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies."

This gives a super-quadratic improvement compared to the best known randomized algorithm for all $\varepsilon = o(1)$. The improvement is cubic when $\varepsilon = 1/\sqrt{n}$."

For any temperature for which the system has a finite correlation length, we prove that the canonical and microcanonical state are approximately equal on regions containing up to $O(N^{1/(d+1)})$ spins. The proof rests on a variant of the Berry--Esseen theorem for quantum lattice systems and ideas from quantum information theory."
643,1501.05319,2015,5,13,20,Maximum nonlocality and minimum uncertainty using magic states,Mark Howard,"We prove that magic states from the Clifford hierarchy give optimal solutions for tasks involving nonlocality and entropic uncertainty with respect to Pauli measurements. For both the nonlocality and uncertainty tasks, stabilizer states are the worst possible pure states so our solutions have an operational interpretation as being highly non-stabilizer. The optimal strategy for a qudit version of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game in prime dimensions is achieved by measuring maximally entangled states that are isomorphic to single-qudit magic states. These magic states have an appealingly simple form and our proof shows that they are ""balanced"" with respect to all but one of the mutually unbiased stabilizer bases. Of all equatorial qudit states, magic states minimize the average entropic uncertainties for collision entropy and also, for small prime dimensions, min-entropy -- a fact that may have implications for cryptography."

The method is very flexible, easy to program and allows the user to assess the behavior of finite dimensional quantum systems in a number of interesting setups. We use this method to bound the strength of quantum nonlocality in bipartite and tripartite Bell scenarios where the dimension of a subset of the parties is bounded from above. We derive new results in quantum communication complexity and prove the soundness of the prepare-and-measure dimension witnesses introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 230501 (2010)]. Finally, we propose a new dimension witness that can distinguish between classical, real and complex two-level systems."
646,1411.3028,2014,3,11,20,A fast fault-tolerant decoder for qubit and qudit surface codes,Fern H E Watson;Hussain Anwar;Daniel E Browne,"The surface code is one of the most promising candidates for combating errors in large scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. A fault-tolerant decoder is a vital part of the error correction process---it is the algorithm which computes the operations needed to correct or compensate for the errors according to the measured syndrome, even when the measurement itself is error prone. Previously decoders based on minimum-weight perfect matching have been studied. However, these are not immediately generalizable from qubit to qudit codes. In this work, we develop a fault-tolerant decoder for the surface code, capable of efficient operation for qubits and qudits of any dimension, generalizing the decoder first introduced by Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 200501 (2013)]. We study its performance when both the physical qudits and the syndromes measurements are subject to generalized uncorrelated bit-flip noise (and the higher dimensional equivalent). We show that, with appropriate enhancements to the decoder and a high enough qudit dimension, a threshold at an error rate of more than 8% can be achieved."
647,1410.4397,2014,2,12,20,Parallel Repetition of Free Entangled Games: Simplification and Improvements,André Chailloux;Giannicola Scarpa,"In a two-player game, two cooperating but non communicating players, Alice and Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution. Each of them produces an output and they win the game if they satisfy some predicate on their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega^*(G)$ of a game $G$ is the maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to share an entangled state prior to receiving their inputs. The $n$-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$ consists of $n$ instances of $G$ where Alice and Bob receive all the inputs at the same time and must produce all the outputs at the same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each instance of $G$. Recently, there has been a series of works showing parallel repetition with exponential decay for projection games [DSV13], games on the uniform distribution [CS14] and for free games, i.e. games on a product distribution [JPY13]. This article is meant to be a follow up of [CS14], where we improve and simplify several parts of our previous paper. Our main result is that for any free game $G$ with value $\omega^*(G)=1-\varepsilon$, we have $\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega(\frac{n}{\log(l)})}$ where $l$ is the size of the output set of the game. This result improves on both the results in [JPY13] and [CS14]. The framework we use can also be extended to free projection games. We show that for a free projection game $G$ with value $\omega^*(G)=1-\varepsilon$, we have $\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 - \varepsilon)^{\Omega(n)}$."

Over the last few decades the field has evolved from a highly theoretical subject to an active experimental area, particularly following proposals for trapping non-Abelian anyons in `engineered' structures built from well-understood components. In this short overview we briefly tour the impressive progress that has taken place in the quest for the simplest type of non-Abelian anyon---defects binding Majorana zero modes---and then turn to similar strategies for pursuing more exotic excitations. Specifically, we describe how interfacing simple quantum Hall systems with conventional superconductors yields `parafermionic' generalizations of Majorana modes and even Fibonacci anyons---the latter enabling fully fault tolerant universal quantum computation. We structure our treatment in a manner that unifies these topics in a coherent way. The ideas synthesized here spotlight largely uncharted experimental territory in the field of quantum Hall physics that appears ripe for discovery."

We derive an upper bound on the second order asymptotic expansion for the quantum communication cost of achieving state redistribution with a given finite accuracy. In proving our result, we also obtain an upper bound on the quantum communication cost of this protocol in the one-shot setting, by using the protocol of coherent state merging as a primitive."

We also consider operator convexity/concavity of $A^{q/2}B^p A^{q/2}$ and convexity/concavity of the closely related trace functional $Trace[ A^{q/2}B^p A^{q/2} C^r]$. For concavity, these questions are completely settled, thereby settling cases left open by Hiai, while the convexity questions are settled in many cases. As a consequence, the Audenaert-Datta Rényi entropy conjectures are proved for some cases."

Here we consider how well this task can be performed using a single qubit to distinguish between two different temperatures of a bosonic bath. In this simple setting, we find that letting the qubit equilibrate with the bath is not optimal, and depending on the interaction time it may be advantageous for the qubit to start in a state with some quantum coherence. We also briefly consider the case that the qubit is initially entangled with a second qubit that is not put into contact with the bath, and show that entanglement allows for even better thermometry."

We do this by showing a general correspondence between systems with CSS structure and finite group algebras, and applying this to the cluster states to derive their generalization. We then investigate properties of these states including their PEPS representations, global symmetries, and relationship to the Kitaev quantum double models. We also discuss possible applications of these states."

In particular, we introduce a new integration scheme for studying time-evolution, which can cope with arbitrary Hamiltonians, including those with long-range interactions. Rather than a Suzuki-Trotter splitting of the Hamiltonian, which is the idea behind the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method or time-evolving block decimation, our method is based on splitting the projector onto the matrix product state tangent space as it appears in the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. We discuss how the resulting algorithm resembles the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states so closely that it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code and it inherits the same stability and efficiency. In particular, our method is compatible with any Hamiltonian for which DMRG can be implemented efficiently and DMRG is obtained as a special case of imaginary time evolution with infinite time step."
654,1408.3415,2014,9,16,20,Symmetry-protected adiabatic quantum transistors,Dominic J Williamson;Stephen D Bartlett,"Adiabatic quantum transistors allow quantum logic gates to be performed by applying a large field to a quantum many-body system prepared in its ground state, without the need for local control. The basic operation of such a device can be viewed as driving a spin chain from a symmetry protected phase to a trivial phase, and this perspective offers an avenue to generalise the adiabatic quantum transistor and to design several improvements. The performance of quantum logic gates is shown to depend only on universal symmetry properties of a symmetry-protected phase rather than fine tuned parent Hamiltonians, and it is possible to implement a universal set of logic gates in this way by combining several different types of symmetry protected matter. Such symmetry-protected adiabatic quantum transistors are argued to be robust to a range of relevant noise processes."
655,1408.3379,2014,9,3,20,Reduced Space-Time and Time Costs Using Dislocation Codes and Arbitrary Ancillas,Matthew B Hastings;A Geller,"We propose two distinct methods of improving quantum computing protocols based on surface codes. First, we analyze the use of dislocations instead of holes to produce logical qubits, potentially reducing spacetime volume required. Dislocations induce defects which, in many respects, behave like Majorana quasi-particles. We construct circuits to implement these codes and present fault-tolerant measurement methods for these and other defects which may reduce spatial overhead. One advantage of these codes is that Hadamard gates take exactly $0$ time to implement. We numerically study the performance of these codes using a minimum weight and a greedy decoder using finite-size scaling. Second, we consider state injection of arbitrary ancillas to produce arbitrary rotations. This avoids the logarithmic (in precision) overhead in online cost required if $T$ gates are used to synthesize arbitrary rotations. While this has been considered before, we consider also the parallel performance of this protocol. Arbitrary ancilla injection leads to a probabilistic protocol in which there is a constant chance of success on each round; we use an amortized analysis to show that even in a parallel setting this leads to only a constant factor slowdown as opposed to the logarithmic slowdown that might be expected naively."
656,1407.8530,2014,9,1,20,PR-box correlations have no classical limit,Daniel Rohrlich,"One of Yakir Aharonov's endlessly captivating physics ideas is the conjecture that two axioms, namely relativistic causality (""no superluminal signalling"") and nonlocality, so nearly contradict each other that a unique theory - quantum mechanics - reconciles them. But superquantum (or ""PR-box"") correlations imply that quantum mechanics is not the most nonlocal theory (in the sense of nonlocal correlations) consistent with relativistic causality. Let us consider supplementing these two axioms with a minimal third axiom: there exists a classical limit in which macroscopic observables commute. That is, just as quantum mechanics has a classical limit, so must any generalization of quantum mechanics. In this classical limit, PR-box correlations violate relativistic causality. Generalized to all stronger-than-quantum bipartite correlations, this result is a derivation of Tsirelson's bound without assuming quantum mechanics."

In this paper, we initiate the study of tensor network non-zero testing (TNZ): Given a tensor network T, does T represent a non-zero vector? We show that TNZ is not in the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy unless the hierarchy collapses. We next show (among other results) that the special cases of TNZ on non-negative and injective tensor networks are in NP. Using this, we make a simple observation: The commuting variant of the MA-complete stoquastic k-SAT problem on D-dimensional qudits is in NP for logarithmic k and constant D. This reveals the first class of quantum Hamiltonians whose commuting variant is known to be in NP for all (1) logarithmic k, (2) constant D, and (3) for arbitrary interaction graphs."
658,1406.0530,2014,8,22,20,Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering provides the advantage in entanglement-assisted subchannel discrimination with one-way measurements,Marco Piani;John Watrous,"Steering is the entanglement-based quantum effect that embodies the ""spooky action at a distance"" disliked by Einstein and scrutinized by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. Here we provide a necessary and sufficient characterization of steering, based on a quantum information processing task: the discrimination of branches in a quantum evolution, which we dub subchannel discrimination. We prove that, for any bipartite steerable state, there are instances of the quantum subchannel discrimination problem for which this state allows a correct discrimination with strictly higher probability than in absence of entanglement, even when measurements are restricted to local measurements aided by one-way communication. On the other hand, unsteerable states are useless in such conditions, even when entangled. We also prove that the above steering advantage can be exactly quantified in terms of the steering robustness, which is a natural measure of the steerability exhibited by the state."
659,1402.4949,2014,8,18,20,The renormalisation group via statistical inference,Cédric Bény;Tobias J Osborne,"In physics one attempts to infer the rules governing a system given only the results of imperfect measurements. Hence, microscopic theories may be effectively indistinguishable experimentally. We develop an operationally motivated procedure to identify the corresponding equivalence classes of states, and argue that the renormalisation group arises from the inherent ambiguities associated with the classes: one encounters flow parameters as, e.g., a regulator, a scale, or a measure of precision, which specify representatives in a given equivalence class. This provides a unifying framework and identifies the role played by information in renormalisation. We validate this idea by showing that it justifies the use of low-momenta n-point functions as statistically relevant observables around a gaussian hypothesis. These results enable the calculation of distinguishability in quantum field theory. Our methods also provide a way to extend renormalisation techniques to effective models which are not based on the usual quantum-field formalism, and elucidates the relationships between various type of RG."

The probability of obtaining this assignment at the end of the quantum evolution measures the success of the algorithm. Here we report three strategies which consistently increase the success probability for the hardest instances in our ensemble: decreasing the overall evolution time, initializing the system in excited states, and adding a random local Hamiltonian to the middle of the evolution."
662,1311.7378,2013,6,23,20,The commuting local Hamiltonian on locally-expanding graphs is in NP,Dorit Aharonov;Lior Eldar,"The local Hamiltonian problem is famously complete for the class QMA, the quantum analogue of NP. The complexity of its semi-classical version, in which the terms of the Hamiltonian are required to commute (the CLH problem), has attracted considerable attention recently due to its intriguing nature, as well as in relation to growing interest in the qPCP conjecture. We show here that if the underlying bipartite interaction graph of the CLH instance is a good locally-expanding graph, namely, the expansion of any constant-size set is e-close to optimal, then approximating its ground energy to within additive factor O(e) lies in NP. The proof holds for k- local Hamiltonians for any constant k and any constant dimensionality of particles d. We also show that the approximation problem of CLH on such good local expanders is NP-hard. This implies that too good local expansion of the interaction graph constitutes an obstacle against quantum hardness of the approximation problem, though it retains its classical hardness. The result highlights new difficulties in trying to mimic classical proofs (in particular Dinur's PCP proof) in an attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture. A related result was discovered recently independently by Brandao and Harrow, for 2-local general Hamiltonians, bounding the quantum hardness of the approximation problem on good expanders, though no NP-hardness is known in that case."
663,1311.6474,2013,6,4,20,An Information-Theoretic Proof of the Constructive Commutative Quantum Lovász Local Lemma,Martin Schwarz;Toby S Cubitt;Frank Verstraete,"The Quantum Lovász Local Lemma (QLLL) [AKS12] establishes non-constructively that any quantum system constrained by a local Hamiltonian has a zero-energy ground state, if the local Hamiltonian terms overlap only in a certain restricted way. In this paper, we present an efficient quantum algorithm to prepare this ground state for the special case of commuting projector terms. The related classical problem has been open for more than 34 years. Our algorithm follows the breakthrough ideas of Moser's [Moser09] classical algorithm and lifts his information theoretic argument to the quantum setting. A similar result has been independently published by Arad and Sattath [AS13] recently."
664,1309.0005,2013,2,21,20,Experimental verification of quantum computations,Stefanie Barz;Joseph F Fitzsimons;Elham Kashefi;Philip Walther,"Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speedups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up new fundamental questions, among them the issue whether or not quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computations. We show, in theory and in experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced in this work utilizes the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is only required to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier can test the computer's ability to perform measurement-based quantum computations."
665,1308.4209,2013,2,18,20,Unitarity of black hole evaporation in final-state projection models,Seth Lloyd;John Preskill,"Almheiri et al. have emphasized that otherwise reasonable beliefs about black hole evaporation are incompatible with the monogamy of quantum entanglement, a general property of quantum mechanics. We investigate the final-state projection model of black hole evaporation proposed by Horowitz and Maldacena, pointing out that this model admits cloning of quantum states and polygamous entanglement, allowing unitarity of the evaporation process to be reconciled with smoothness of the black hole event horizon. Though the model seems to require carefully tuned dynamics to ensure exact unitarity of the black hole S-matrix, for a generic final-state boundary condition the deviations from unitarity are exponentially small in the black hole entropy; furthermore observers inside black holes need not detect any deviations from standard quantum mechanics. Though measurements performed inside old black holes could potentially produce causality-violating phenomena, the computational complexity of decoding the Hawking radiation may render the causality violation unobservable. Final-state projection models illustrate how inviolable principles of standard quantum mechanics might be circumvented in a theory of quantum gravity."
666,1307.6222,2013,1,29,20,Entropic Barriers for Two-Dimensional Quantum Memories,Benjamin J Brown;Abbas Al-Shimary;Jiannis K Pachos,"Comprehensive no-go theorems show that information encoded over local two-dimensional topologically ordered systems cannot support macroscopic energy barriers, and hence will not maintain stable quantum information at finite temperatures for macroscopic timescales. However, it is still well motivated to study low-dimensional quantum memories due to their experimental amenability. Here we introduce a grid of defect lines to Kitaev's quantum double model where different anyonic excitations carry different masses. This setting produces a complex energy landscape which entropically suppresses the diffusion of excitations that cause logical errors. We show numerically that entropically suppressed errors give rise to super-exponential inverse temperature scaling and polynomial system size scaling for small system sizes over a low-temperature regime. Curiously, these entropic effects are not present below a certain low temperature. We show that we can vary the system to modify this bound and potentially extend the described effects to zero temperature."

It is computationally equivalent to the circuit model. Unlike the circuit model, however, its classical analog is little studied. Here we present a classical analog of MBQC whose computational complexity presents a rich structure. To do so, we identify uniform families of quantum computations (refining the circuits introduced by Bremner, Jozsa and Shepherd in Proc. R. Soc. A 467, 459 (2011)) whose output is likely hard to exactly simulate (sample) classically. We demonstrate that these circuit families can be efficiently implemented in the MBQC model without adaptive measurement, and thus can be achieved in a classical analog of MBQC whose resource state is a probability distribution which has been created quantum mechanically. Such states (by definition) violate no Bell inequality, but nevertheless exhibit non-classicality when used as a computational resource - an imprint of their quantum origin."
668,1302.3865,2013,11,27,20,Upper bounds on mixing rates,Elliott H Lieb;Anna Vershynina,"We prove upper bounds on the rate, called ""mixing rate"", at which the von Neumann entropy of the expected density operator of a given ensemble of states changes under non-local unitary evolution. For an ensemble consisting of two states, with probabilities of p and 1-p, we prove that the mixing rate is bounded above by 4\sqrtp(1-p) for any Hamiltonian of norm 1. For a general ensemble of states with probabilities distributed according to a random variable X and individually evolving according to any set of bounded Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the mixing rate is bounded above by a Shannon entropy of a random variable X. For this general case we prove an upper bound that is independent of the dimension of the Hilbert space on which states in the ensemble act."

In this review we consider the formalism of qubit stabilizer and subsystem stabilizer codes and their possible use in protecting quantum information in a quantum memory. We review the theory of fault-tolerance and quantum error-correction, discuss examples of various codes and code constructions, the general quantum error correction conditions, the noise threshold, the special role played by Clifford gates and the route towards fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. The second part of the review is focused on providing an overview of quantum error correction using two-dimensional (topological) codes, in particular the surface code architecture. We discuss the complexity of decoding and the notion of passive or self-correcting quantum memories. The review does not focus on a particular technology but discusses topics that will be relevant for various quantum technologies."
670,1301.4504,2013,8,21,20,Quantum Computation vs. Firewalls,Daniel Harlow;Patrick Hayden,"In this paper we discuss quantum computational restrictions on the types of thought experiments recently used by Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully to argue against the smoothness of black hole horizons. We argue that the quantum computations required to do these experiments take a time which is exponential in the entropy of the black hole under study, and we show that for a wide variety of black holes this prevents the experiments from being done. We interpret our results as motivating a broader type of non-locality than is usually considered in the context of black hole thought experiments, and claim that once this type of non-locality is allowed there may be no need for firewalls. Our results do not threaten the unitarity of of black hole evaporation or the ability of advanced civilizations to test it."

We show that there are three classes of noisy channels: In the first, typified by the depolarizing channel, computation is only possible for a logarithmic time. In the second class, of which the dephasing channel is an example, computation is possible for polynomial time. The amplitude damping channel is an example of the third class, and for this class of channels, it is possible to compute for an exponential time in the number of qubits available."

While there is no lower bound on the required energy or space to store information, we find that there is a nonzero lower bound for the product (P = <E> <r^2>) of these two resources. Specifically, we prove that any physical system of mass m and d degrees of freedom that stores S bits of information will have lower bound on the product P that is proportional to d^2/m (exp(S/d)-1)^2. This result is obtained in a non-relativistic, quantum mechanical setting and it is independent from earlier thermodynamical results such as the Bekenstein bound on the entropy of black holes."
673,1211.6120,2012,2,18,20,Two-message quantum interactive proofs and the quantum separability problem,Patrick Hayden;Kevin Milner;Mark M Wilde,"Suppose that a polynomial-time mixed-state quantum circuit, described as a sequence of local unitary interactions followed by a partial trace, generates a quantum state shared between two parties. One might then wonder, does this quantum circuit produce a state that is separable or entangled? Here, we give evidence that it is computationally hard to decide the answer to this question, even if one has access to the power of quantum computation. We begin by exhibiting a two-message quantum interactive proof system that can decide the answer to a promise version of the question. We then prove that the promise problem is hard for the class of promise problems with ""quantum statistical zero knowledge"" (QSZK) proof systems by demonstrating a polynomial-time Karp reduction from the QSZK-complete promise problem ""quantum state distinguishability"" to our quantum separability problem. By exploiting Knill's efficient encoding of a matrix description of a state into a description of a circuit to generate the state, we can show that our promise problem is NP-hard with respect to Cook reductions. Thus, the quantum separability problem (as phrased above) constitutes the first nontrivial promise problem decidable by a two-message quantum interactive proof system while being hard for both NP and QSZK. We also consider a variant of the problem, in which a given polynomial-time mixed-state quantum circuit accepts a quantum state as input, and the question is to decide if there is an input to this circuit which makes its output separable across some bipartite cut. We prove that this problem is a complete promise problem for the class QIP of problems decidable by quantum interactive proof systems. Finally, we show that a two-message quantum interactive proof system can also decide a multipartite generalization of the quantum separability problem."

A key question is: how big is the advantage of exact quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts: deterministic algorithms. For total Boolean functions in the query model, the biggest known gap was just a factor of 2: PARITY of N inputs bits requires $N$ queries classically but can be computed with N/2 queries by an exact quantum algorithm. We present the first example of a Boolean function f(x_1, ..., x_N) for which exact quantum algorithms have superlinear advantage over the deterministic algorithms. Any deterministic algorithm that computes our function must use N queries but an exact quantum algorithm can compute it with O(N^0.8675...) queries."
675,1209.2713,2012,1,22,20,Explicit relation between all lower bound techniques for quantum query complexity,Loïck Magnin;Jérémie Roland,"The polynomial method and the adversary method are the two main techniques to prove lower bounds on quantum query complexity, and they have so far been considered as unrelated approaches. Here, we show an explicit reduction from the polynomial method to the multiplicative adversary method. The proof goes by extending the polynomial method from Boolean functions to quantum state generation problems. In the process, the bound is even strengthened. We then show that this extended polynomial method is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method with an adversary matrix that is independent of the function. This new result therefore provides insight on the reason why in some cases the adversary method is stronger than the polynomial method. It also reveals a clear picture of the relation between the different lower bound techniques, as it implies that all known techniques reduce to the multiplicative adversary method."

This allows for validation and debugging of algorithms as well as exploring hardware-software co-design to guide the development of quantum hardware and architectures. The simulation of quantum computers entails multiplications of sparse matrices with very large dense vectors of dimension $2^n$, where $n$ denotes the number of qubits, making this a memory-bound and network bandwidth-limited application. We introduce the concept of a quantum computer \textitemulator as a component of a software framework for quantum computing, enabling a significant performance advantage over simulators by emulating quantum algorithms at a high level rather than simulating individual gate operations. We describe various optimization approaches and present benchmarking results, establishing the superiority of quantum computer emulators in terms of performance."
677,1612.05215,2016,12,18,19,Gaussian entanglement revised,Ludovico Lami;Alessio Serafini;Gerardo Adesso,"In this paper we present a novel approach to the problem of separability versus entanglement of Gaussian quantum states of bosonic continuous variable systems, as well as new proofs of closely related results. We first review the currently known results stating the equivalence between separability and positive partial transposition (PPT) for specific classes of multimode Gaussian states. Using techniques based on matrix analysis, such as Schur complements and matrix means, we then provide a unified treatment and greatly simplified proofs of all these results. In particular, we recover the PPT-separability equivalence theorem for Gaussian states of $1$ vs $n$ modes, for arbitrary $n$. Next, we provide a previously unknown extension of this equivalence, proving that it is valid also for arbitrary Gaussian states of $m$ vs $n$ modes that are symmetric under the exchange of any two modes belonging to one of the parties. Finally, we include a new proof of the sufficiency of the PPT criterion for separability of isotropic Gaussian states, not relying on the mode-wise decomposition of pure Gaussian states. In passing, we also provide an alternative proof of the recently established equivalence between separability of an arbitrary Gaussian state and its complete extendability with Gaussian extensions. While this paper may be seen as a divertissement enjoyable by both the quantum optics and the matrix analysis communities, the tools adopted here are likely to be useful for further applications in continuous variable quantum information theory, beyond the separability problem."

This is not the case for the quantum capacity of a channel: the capacity of a mixture of different quantum channels exceeds the mixture of the individual capacities and thus is non-convex. Here we show that this effect goes beyond the quantum capacity and holds for the private and classical environment-assisted capacities of quantum channels.

Lett. 101, 130504 (2008)] that simulates a classical annealing process for solving discrete optimization problems. The complexity of the quantum algorithm scales with the inverse square root of the spectral gap of an associated stochastic matrix. This represents a quadratic quantum speedup, in terms of the gap, with respect to classical simulated annealing."

We do this using the negative-weighted adversary method. Thus, we reprove the result by Aaronson and Shi, as well as a very recent development by Zhandry."
681,1610.09434,2016,4,25,19,The Universal Composable Security of Quantum Message Authentication with Key Recyling,Patrick Hayden;Debbie W Leung;Dominic Mayers,"Barnum, Crepeau, Gottesman, Tapp, and Smith (quant-ph/0205128) proposed methods for authentication of quantum messages. The first method is an interactive protocol (TQA') based on teleportation. The second method is a noninteractive protocol (QA) in which the sender first encrypts the message using a protocol QEnc and then encodes the quantum ciphertext with an error correcting code chosen secretly from a set (a purity test code (PTC)). Encryption was shown to be necessary for authentication. We augment the protocol QA with an extra step which recycles the entire encryption key provided QA accepts the message. We analyze the resulting integrated protocol for quantum authentication and key generation, which we call QA+KG. Our main result is a proof that QA+KG is universal composably (UC) secure in the Ben-Or-Mayers model (quant-ph/0409062). More specifically, this implies the UC-security of (a) QA, (b) recycling of the encryption key in QA, and (c) key-recycling of the encryption scheme QEnc by appending PTC. For an m-qubit message, encryption requires 2m bits of key; but PTC can be performed using only O(log m) + O(log e) bits of key for probability of failure e. Thus, we reduce the key required for both QA and QEnc, from linear to logarithmic net consumption, at the expense of one bit of back communication which can happen any time after the conclusion of QA and before reusing the key. UC-security of QA also extends security to settings not obvious from quant-ph/0205128. Our security proof structure is inspired by and similar to that of quant-ph/0205128, reducing the security of QA to that of TQA'. In the process, we define UC-secure entanglement, and prove the UC-security of the entanglement generating protocol given in quant-ph/0205128, which could be of independent interest."
682,1609.09487,2016,12,14,19,Quantum common causes and quantum causal models,John-Mark A Allen;Jonathan Barrett;Dominic C Horsman;Ciarán M Lee;Robert W Spekkens,"Reichenbach's principle asserts that if two observed variables are found to be correlated, then there should be a causal explanation of these correlations. Furthermore, if the explanation is in terms of a common cause, then the conditional probability distribution over the variables given the complete common cause should factorize. The principle is generalized by the formalism of causal models, in which the causal relationships among variables constrain the form of their joint probability distribution. In the quantum case, however, the observed correlations in Bell experiments cannot be explained in the manner Reichenbach's principle would seem to demand. Motivated by this, we introduce a quantum counterpart to the principle. We demonstrate that under the assumption that quantum dynamics is fundamentally unitary, if a quantum channel with input A and outputs B and C is compatible with A being a complete common cause of B and C, then it must factorize in a particular way. Finally, we show how to generalize our quantum version of Reichenbach's principle to a formalism for quantum causal models, and provide examples of how the formalism works."

We show analytically that these correlations are local for $ v = 682/1000$. In turn, this implies a new bound on the Grothendieck constant $K_G(3) \leq 1000/682 \simeq 1.4663$, as the two problems are closely related. We also present a LHV model for reproducing the statistics of arbitrary POVMs on the Werner state for $v = 341/750 \simeq 0.4547$. The techniques we develop can be adapted to construct LHV models for other entangled states, as well as bounding other Grothendieck constants."

They do not only serve as variational states in numerical simulation methods, but also provide a framework for classifying phases of quantum matter and capture notions of topological order in a stringent and rigorous language. The rapid development in this field for spin models and bosonic systems has not yet been mirrored by an analogous development for fermionic models. In this work, we introduce a framework of tensor networks having a fermionic component capable of capturing notions of topological order. At the heart of the formalism are axioms of fermionic matrix product operator injectivity, stable under concatenation. Building upon that, we formulate a Grassmann number tensor network ansatz for the ground state of fermionic twisted quantum double models. A specific focus is put on the paradigmatic example of the fermionic toric code. This work shows that the program of describing topologically ordered systems using tensor networks carries over to fermionic models."

Amongst other properties, we (a) obtain speed-ups over the best known quantum algorithms for identity testing, equivalence testing and uniformity testing of probability distributions; (b) study the power of these oracles for testing properties of boolean functions, and obtain an algorithm for checking whether an $n$-input $m$-output boolean function is balanced or $\epsilon$-far from balanced; and (c) give a sub-linear algorithm, requiring $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4}/\epsilon)$ queries, for testing whether an $n$-dimensional quantum state is maximally mixed or not."

The classical limit of H is 2xp, which is consistent with the Berry-Keating conjecture. While H is not Hermitian, iH is symmetric under PT reflection. The PT symmetry appears to be maximally broken, which suggests that the eigenvalues of H are real and that the Riemann hypothesis is valid. Further heuristic analysis of H supports the conclusion that its eigenvalues are real."

Here, we study wavefunctions obtained by symmetrizing quantum double models of a group $G$ in the Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) formalism. We show that symmetrization naturally gives rise to a larger symmetry group $\tilde G$ which is always non-abelian. We prove that by symmetrizing on sufficiently large blocks, one can always construct wavefunctions in the same phase as the double model of $\tilde G$. In order to understand the effect of symmetrization on smaller patches, we carry out numerical studies for the toric code model, where we find strong evidence that symmetrizing on individual spins gives rise to a critical model which is at the phase transitions of two inequivalent toric codes, obtained by anyon condensation from the double model of $\tilde G$."

Given an operation for accessing the elements of the matrix, our method allows singular values and associated singular vectors to be found quantum mechanically in a time exponentially faster in the dimension of the matrix than known classical algorithms. The method extends to non-Hermitian and non-square matrices via embedding matrices. In the context of the generic singular value decomposition of a matrix, we discuss the Procrustes problem of finding a closest isometry to a given matrix."

This construction comes with a wealth of examples from the literature of symmetry-enriched topological phases. The corresponding unitary state sum topological quantum fields theories (TQFT) appear to capture all known constructions in the literature, including the Crane-Yetter-Walker-Wang and 2-Group gauge theory models. We also present Hamiltonian realizations of a state sum TQFT recently constructed by Kashaev whose relation to existing models was previously unknown. We argue that this TQFT is captured as a special case of the Crane-Yetter-Walker-Wang model, in some cases with a premodular category."
690,1606.02685,2016,8,3,19,Optimal Hamiltonian Simulation by Quantum Signal Processing,Guang Hao Low;Isaac L Chuang,"The physics of quantum mechanics is the inspiration for, and underlies, quantum computation. As such, one expects physical intuition to be highly influential in the understanding and design of many quantum algorithms, particularly simulation of physical systems. Surprisingly, this has been challenging, with current Hamiltonian simulation algorithms remaining abstract and often the result of sophisticated but unintuitive constructions. We contend that physical intuition can lead to optimal simulation methods by showing that a focus on simple single-qubit rotations elegantly furnishes an optimal algorithm for Hamiltonian simulation, a universal problem that encapsulates all the power of quantum computation. Specifically, we show that the query complexity of implementing time evolution by a $d$-sparse Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ for time-interval $t$ with error $\epsilon$ is $\mathcal{O}(td\|\hat{H}\|_{\text{max}}+\frac{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}{\log{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}})$, which matches lower bounds in all parameters. This connection is made through general three-step ""quantum signal processing"" methodology, comprised of (1) transducing eigenvalues of $\hat{H}$ into a single ancilla qubit, (2) transforming these eigenvalues through an optimal-length sequence of single-qubit rotations, and (3) projecting this ancilla with near unity success probability."
691,1605.09071,2016,7,20,19,Randomized query complexity of sabotaged and composed functions,Shalev Ben-David;Robin Kothari,"We study the composition question for bounded-error randomized query complexity: Is R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) R(g)) for all Boolean functions f and g? We show that inserting a simple Boolean function h, whose query complexity is only Theta(log R(g)), in between f and g allows us to prove R(f o h o g) = Omega(R(f) R(h) R(g)). We prove this using a new lower bound measure for randomized query complexity we call randomized sabotage complexity, RS(f). Randomized sabotage complexity has several desirable properties, such as a perfect composition theorem, RS(f o g) >= RS(f) RS(g), and a composition theorem with randomized query complexity, R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) RS(g)). It is also a quadratically tight lower bound for total functions and can be quadratically superior to the partition bound, the best known general lower bound for randomized query complexity. Using this technique we also show implications for lifting theorems in communication complexity. We show that a general lifting theorem for zero-error randomized protocols implies a general lifting theorem for bounded-error protocols."
692,1605.01420,2016,6,9,19,Uncertainty relations and approximate quantum error correction,Joseph M Renes,"The uncertainty principle can be understood as constraining the probability of winning a game in which Alice measures one of two conjugate observables, such as position or momentum, on a system provided by Bob, and he is to guess the outcome. Two variants are possible: either Alice tells Bob which observable she measured, or he has to furnish guesses for both cases. Here I derive new uncertainty relations for both, formulated directly in terms of Bob's guessing probabilities. For the former these relate to the entanglement that can be recovered by action on Bob's system alone. This gives a condition for approximate quantum error correction in terms of the recoverability of ""amplitude"" and ""phase"" information, implicitly used in the recent construction of efficient quantum polar codes. I also find a tight relation on the guessing probabilities for the latter game, which has application to wave-particle duality relations."
693,1605.00806,2016,5,31,19,Measures and applications of quantum correlations,Gerardo Adesso;Thomas R Bromley;Marco Cianciaruso,"Quantum information theory is built upon the realisation that quantum resources like coherence and entanglement can be exploited for novel or enhanced ways of transmitting and manipulating information, such as quantum cryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing. We now know that there is potentially much more than entanglement behind the power of quantum information processing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations, stemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced by a local measurement, or the persistence of quantum coherence in all possible local bases. These signatures can be identified and are resilient in almost all quantum states, and have been linked to the enhanced performance of certain quantum protocols over classical ones in noisy conditions. Their presence represents, among other things, one of the most essential manifestations of quantumness in cooperative systems, from the subatomic to the macroscopic domain. In this work we give an overview of the current quest for a proper understanding and characterisation of the frontier between classical and quantum correlations in composite states. We focus on various approaches to define and quantify general quantum correlations, based on different yet interlinked physical perspectives, and comment on the operational significance of the ensuing measures for quantum technology tasks such as information encoding, distribution, discrimination and metrology. We then provide a broader outlook of a few applications in which quantumness beyond entanglement looks fit to play a key role."
694,1601.00966,2016,5,6,19,Capacities of repeater-assisted quantum communications,Stefano Pirandola,"We establish the ultimate rates for transmitting quantum information, distilling entanglement, and distributing secret keys in repeater-assisted quantum communications, under the most fundamental decoherence models for both discrete and continuous variable systems, including lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels. These capacities are derived considering the most general adaptive protocols for quantum and private communication between the two end-points of a repeater chain and, more generally, of an arbitrarily-complex quantum network or internet, where systems may be routed though single or multiple paths. Our methodology combines tools from quantum information and classical network theory. Converse results are derived by introducing a novel tensor-product representation for a quantum communication network, where quantum channels are replaced by their Choi matrices. Exploiting this representation and suitable entanglement cuts of the network, we upperbound the end-to-end capacities by means of the relative entropy of entanglement. Achievability of the bounds is proven by combining point-to-point quantum communications with classical network algorithms, so that optimal routing strategies are found by determining the widest path and the maximum flow in the network. In this way we extend both the widest path problem and the max-flow min-cut theorem from classical to quantum communications. Finally, we generalize our results to multiple senders and receivers in the quantum network, proving a quantum version of the network coding theorem for multi-end quantum key distribution."

In particular, the fidelity of recovery quantifies how well one can recover a system $A$ of a tripartite quantum state, defined on systems $ABC$, by acting on system $C$ alone. The relative entropy of recovery is an associated measure in which the fidelity is replaced by relative entropy. In this paper, we provide concrete operational interpretations of the aforementioned recovery measures in terms of a computational decision problem and a hypothesis testing scenario. Specifically, we show that the fidelity of recovery is equal to the maximum probability with which a computationally unbounded quantum prover can convince a computationally bounded quantum verifier that a given quantum state is recoverable. The quantum interactive proof system giving this operational meaning requires four messages exchanged between the prover and verifier, but by forcing the prover to perform his actions in superposition, we construct a different proof system that requires only two messages. The result is that the associated decision problem is in QIP(2) and another argument establishes it as hard for QSZK (both classes contain problems believed to be difficult to solve for a quantum computer). We finally prove that the regularized relative entropy of recovery is equal to the optimal Type II error exponent when trying to distinguish many copies of a tripartite state from a recovered version of this state, such that the Type I error is constrained to be no larger than a constant."
696,1511.00727,2015,1,7,19,Bounding experimental quantum error rates relative to fault-tolerant thresholds,Joel J Wallman,"Rigorously establishing that the error in an experimental quantum operation is beneath the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation currently requires considering the worst-case error, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the average gate infidelities routinely reported in experiments. We show that an improved bound on the worst-case error can be obtained by also considering the recently-introduced unitarity of the noise where the upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of $\approx 2.45$ for unital qubit channels. We prove that the contribution from the nonunital part of any noise map is at most on the order of the average gate infidelity and so is negligible relative to any coherent contribution. We also show that the ""average"" error rate when measurements are not restricted to an eigenbasis containing the state of the system exhibits the same scaling as the worst-case error, which, for coherent noise, is the square-root of the infidelity. We also obtain improved bounds for the diamond distance when the noise map is known (or approximately known)."
697,1511.00714,2015,12,17,19,Derandomizing quantum circuits with measurement based unitary designs,Peter S Turner;Damian Markham,"Entangled multipartite states are resources for universal quantum computation, but they can also give rise to ensembles of unitary transformations, a topic usually studied in the context of random quantum circuits. Using several graph state techniques, we show that these resources can `derandomize' circuit results by sampling the same kinds of ensembles quantum mechanically, (analogously to a quantum random number generator). Furthermore, we find simple examples that give rise to new ensembles whose statistical moments exactly match those of the uniformly random distribution over all unitaries up to order $t$, while foregoing adaptive feed-forward entirely. Such ensembles -- known as $t$-designs -- often cannot be distinguished from the `truly' random ensemble, and so they find use in many applications that require this implied notion of pseudorandomness."
698,1510.08352,2015,11,4,19,Quantum Oracle Classification - The Case of Group Structure,Mark Zhandry,"The Quantum Oracle Classification (QOC) problem is to classify a function, given only quantum black box access, into one of several classes without necessarily determining the entire function. Generally, QOC captures a very wide range of problems in quantum query complexity. However, relatively little is known about many of these problems. In this work, we analyze the a subclass of the QOC problems where there is a group structure. That is, suppose the range of the unknown function A is a commutative group G, which induces a commutative group law over the entire function space. Then we consider the case where A is drawn uniformly at random from some subgroup A of the function space. Moreover, there is a homomorpism f on A, and the goal is to determine f(A). This class of problems is very general, and covers several interesting cases, such as oracle evaluation; polynomial interpolation, evaluation, and extrapolation; and parity. These problems are important in the study of message authentication codes in the quantum setting, and may have other applications. We exactly characterize the quantum query complexity of every instance of QOC with group structure in terms of a particular counting problem. That is, we provide an algorithm for this general class of problems whose success probability is determined by the solution to the counting problem, and prove its exact optimality. Unfortunately, solving this counting problem in general is a non-trivial task, and we resort to analyzing special cases. Our bounds unify some existing results, such as the existing oracle evaluation and parity bounds. In the case of polynomial interpolation and evaluation, our bounds give new results for secret sharing and information theoretic message authentication codes in the quantum setting."

Since Richard Feynman's famous ""plenty of room at the bottom"" lecture, hinting at the notion of novel devices employing quantum mechanics, the quantum information community has taken gigantic strides in understanding the potential applications of a quantum computer and laid the foundational requirements for building one. We believe that the next significant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory, in which a system of interacting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the incorporated parts. Here, we describe the important route towards a logical memory with superconducting qubits, employing a rotated version of the surface code. The current status of technology with regards to interconnected superconducting-qubit networks will be described and near-term areas of focus to improve devices will be identified. Overall, the progress in this exciting field has been astounding, but we are at an important turning point where it will be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum architectural considerations, laying the foundation towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers in the near future."
700,1509.07458,2015,10,29,19,Relating the Resource Theories of Entanglement and Quantum Coherence,Eric Chitambar;Min-Hsiu Hsieh,"Quantum coherence and quantum entanglement represent two fundamental features of non-classical systems that can each be characterized within an operational resource theory. In this paper, we unify the resource theories of entanglement and coherence by studying their combined behavior in the operational setting of local incoherent operations and classical communication (LIOCC). Specifically we analyze the coherence and entanglement trade-offs in the tasks of state formation and resource distillation. For pure states we identify the minimum coherence-entanglement resources needed to generate a given state, and we introduce a new LIOCC monotone that completely characterizes a state's optimal rate of bipartite coherence distillation. This result allows us to precisely quantify the difference in operational powers between global incoherent operations, LIOCC, and local incoherent operations \textitwithout classical communication. Finally, a bipartite mixed state is shown to have distillable entanglement if and only if entanglement can be distilled by LIOCC, and we strengthen the well-known Horodecki criterion for distillability."
701,1507.00903,2015,10,16,19,Quantum Tomography of Semi-Algebraic Sets with Constrained Measurements,Michael Kech;Michael M Wolf,"We analyse quantum state tomography in scenarios where measurements and states are both constrained. States are assumed to live in a semi-algebraic subset of state space and measurements are supposed to be rank-one POVMs, possibly with additional constraints. Specifically, we consider sets of von Neumann measurements and sets of local observables. We provide upper bounds on the minimal number of measurement settings or outcomes that are required for discriminating all states within the given set. The bounds exploit tools from real algebraic geometry and lead to generic results that do not only show the existence of good measurements but guarantee that almost all measurements with the same dimension characteristic perform equally well. In particular, we show that on an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space any two states of a semi-algebraic subset can be discriminated by $k$ generic von Neumann measurements if $k(n-1)$ is larger than twice the dimension of the subset. In case the subset is given by states of rank at most $r$, we show that $k$ generic von Neumann measurements suffice to discriminate any two states provided that $k(n-1)>4r(n-r)-2$. Furthermore, we obtain corresponding results for low-rank matrix recovery of hermitian matrices and the phase retrieval problem."
702,1506.07133,2015,9,25,19,Do black holes create polyamory?,Andrzej Grudka;Michael J W Hall;Michał Horodecki;Ryszard Horodecki;Jonathan Oppenheim;John A Smolin,"Of course not, but if one believes that information cannot be destroyed in a theory of quantum gravity, then we run into apparent contradictions with quantum theory when we consider evaporating black holes. Namely that the no-cloning theorem or the principle of entanglement monogamy is violated. Here, we show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes lead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure between two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally connected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal structure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or non-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating space times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally related to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements performed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular example of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it needn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For measurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce the notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a choice for measurements as the tensor product. For black holes, the tensor and temporal products have the same measurement statistics, but result in different type of non-monogamy of correlations, with the former being forbidden in quantum theory while the latter is allowed. In the case of the AMPS firewall experiment we find that the entanglement structure is modified, and one must have entanglement between the infalling Hawking partners and early time outgoing Hawking radiation which surprisingly tame violation of entanglement monogamy."
703,1505.00907,2015,9,18,19,Potential capacities of quantum channels,Andreas Winter;Dong Yang,"We introduce potential capacities of quantum channels in an operational way and provide upper bounds for these quantities, which quantify the ultimate limit of usefulness of a channel for a given task in the best possible context. Unfortunately, except for a few isolated cases, potential capacities seem to be as hard to compute as their ""plain"" analogues. We thus study upper bounds on some potential capacities: For the classical capacity, we give an upper bound in terms of the entanglement of formation. To establish a bound for the quantum and private capacity, we first ""lift"" the channel to a Hadamard channel and then prove that the quantum and private capacity of a Hadamard channel is strongly additive, implying that for these channels, potential and plain capacity are equal. Employing these upper bounds we show that if a channel is noisy, however close it is to the noiseless channel, then it cannot be activated into the noiseless channel by any other contextual channel; this conclusion holds for all the three capacities. We also discuss the so-called environment-assisted quantum capacity, because we are able to characterize its ""potential"" version."
704,1505.00049,2015,7,6,19,Uncertainty Relations for Angular Momentum,Lars Dammeier;René Schwonnek;Reinhard F Werner,"In this work we study various notions of uncertainty for angular momentum in the spin-s representation of SU(2). We characterize the ""uncertainty regions'' given by all vectors, whose components are specified by the variances of the three angular momentum components. A basic feature of this set is a lower bound for the sum of the three variances. We give a method for obtaining optimal lower bounds for uncertainty regions for general operator triples, and evaluate these for small s. Further lower bounds are derived by generalizing the technique by which Robertson obtained his state-dependent lower bound. These are optimal for large s, since they are saturated by states taken from the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that, for all s, all variances are consistent with the so-called vector model, i.e., they can also be realized by a classical probability measure on a sphere of radius sqrt(s(s+1)). Entropic uncertainty relations can be discussed similarly, but are minimized by different states than those minimizing the variances for small s. For large s the Maassen-Uffink bound becomes sharp and we explicitly describe the extremalizing states. Measurement uncertainty, as recently discussed by Busch, Lahti and Werner for position and momentum, is introduced and a generalized observable (POVM) which minimizes the worst case measurement uncertainty of all angular momentum components is explicitly determined, along with the minimal uncertainty. The output vectors for the optimal measurement all have the same length r(s), where r(s)/s goes to 1 as s tends to infinity."
705,1503.06319,2015,6,24,19,Quantum simulations of one dimensional quantum systems,Rolando D Somma,"We present quantum algorithms for the simulation of quantum systems in one spatial dimension, which result in quantum speedups that range from superpolynomial to polynomial. We first describe a method to simulate the evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) based on a refined analysis of the Trotter-Suzuki formula that exploits the Lie algebra structure. For total evolution time $t$ and precision $\epsilon>0$, the complexity of our method is $ O(\exp(\gamma \sqrt{\log(N/\epsilon)}))$, where $\gamma>0$ is a constant and $N$ is the quantum number associated with an ""energy cutoff"" of the initial state. Remarkably, this complexity is subpolynomial in $N/\epsilon$. We also provide a method to prepare discrete versions of the eigenstates of the QHO of complexity polynomial in $\log(N)/\epsilon$, where $N$ is the dimension or number of points in the discretization. This method may be of independent interest as it provides a way to prepare, e.g., quantum states with Gaussian-like amplitudes. Next, we consider a system with a quartic potential. Our numerical simulations suggest a method for simulating the evolution of sublinear complexity $\tilde O(N^{1/3+o(1)})$, for constant $t$ and $\epsilon$. We also analyze complex one-dimensional systems and prove a complexity bound $\tilde O(N)$, under fairly general assumptions. Our quantum algorithms may find applications in other problems. As an example, we discuss the fractional Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform that is useful for signal analysis and can be formulated in terms of the evolution of the QHO."
706,1502.02563,2015,5,6,19,Device-Independent Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation,Michal Hajdušek;Carlos A Pérez-Delgado;Joseph F Fitzsimons,"As progress on experimental quantum processors continues to advance, the problem of verifying the correct operation of such devices is becoming a pressing concern. The recent discovery of protocols for verifying computation performed by entangled but non-communicating quantum processors holds the promise of certifying the correctness of arbitrary quantum computations in a fully device-independent manner. Unfortunately, all known schemes have prohibitive overhead, with resources scaling as extremely high degree polynomials in the number of gates constituting the computation. Here we present a novel approach based on a combination of verified blind quantum computation and Bell state self-testing. This approach has dramatically reduced overhead, with resources scaling as only $O(m^4\ln m)$ in the number of gates."
707,1502.02175,2015,5,4,19,Random constructions in Bell inequalities: A survey,Carlos Palazuelos,"Initially motivated by their relevance in foundations of quantum mechanics and more recently by their applications in different contexts of quantum information science, violations of Bell inequalities have been extensively studied during the last years. In particular, an important effort has been made in order to quantify such Bell violations. Probabilistic techniques have been heavily used in this context with two different purposes. First, to quantify how common the phenomenon of Bell violations is; and secondly, to find large Bell violations in order to better understand the possibilities and limitations of this phenomenon. However, the strong mathematical content of these results has discouraged some of the potentially interested readers. The aim of the present work is to review some of the recent results in this direction by focusing on the main ideas and removing most of the technical details, to make the previous study more accessible to a wide audience."

This generalization is obtained by applying the time-dependent variational principle to the variational manifold of continuous matrix product states. This allows for a full quantum description of many body system ---including entanglement and correlations--- and thus extends significantly beyond the usual mean-field description of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is known to fail for (quasi) one-dimensional systems."
709,1501.00652,2015,2,10,19,Gaussian optimizers and the additivity problem in quantum information theory,A S Holevo,"We give a survey of the two remarkable analytical problems of quantum information theory. The main part is a detailed report of the recent (partial) solution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem which establishes an optimal property of Glauber's coherent states -- a particular instance of pure quantum Gaussian states. We elaborate on the notion of quantum Gaussian channel as a noncommutative generalization of Gaussian kernel to show that the coherent states, and under certain conditions only they, minimize a broad class of the concave functionals of the output of a Gaussian channel. Thus, the output states corresponding to the Gaussian input are ""the least chaotic"", majorizing all the other outputs. The solution, however, is essentially restricted to the gauge-invariant case where a distinguished complex structure plays a special role. We also comment on the related famous additivity conjecture, which was solved in principle in the negative some five years ago. This refers to the additivity or multiplicativity (with respect to tensor products of channels) of information quantities related to the classical capacity of quantum channel, such as $(1\rightarrow p)$-norms or the minimal von Neumann or Rényi output entropies. A remarkable corollary of the present solution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem is that these additivity properties, while not valid in general, do hold in the important and interesting class of the gauge-covariant Gaussian channels."

As such, it provides a powerful way to complement usual refocusing techniques. Relaxation imposes a fundamental limit on the sensitivity of state of the art quantum sensors which cannot be overcome by dynamical decoupling. The only way to overcome this is to utilize quantum error correcting codes. We present a superconducting magnetometry design that incorporates approximate quantum error correction, in which the signal is generated by a two qubit Hamiltonian term. This two-qubit term is provided by the dynamics of a tunable coupler between two transmon qubits. For fast enough correction, it is possible to lengthen the coherence time of the device beyond the relaxation limit."
711,1407.5103,2014,1,28,19,Quantum computing by color-code lattice surgery,Andrew J Landahl;Ciaran Ryan-Anderson,"We demonstrate how to use lattice surgery to enact a universal set of fault-tolerant quantum operations with color codes. Along the way, we also improve existing surface-code lattice-surgery methods. Lattice-surgery methods use fewer qubits and the same time or less than associated defect-braiding methods. Furthermore, per code distance, color-code lattice surgery uses approximately half the qubits and the same time or less than surface-code lattice surgery. Color-code lattice surgery can also implement the Hadamard and phase gates in a single transversal step---much faster than surface-code lattice surgery can. Against uncorrelated circuit-level depolarizing noise, color-code lattice surgery uses fewer qubits to achieve the same degree of fault-tolerant error suppression as surface-code lattice surgery when the noise rate is low enough and the error suppression demand is high enough."
712,1406.3055,2014,1,6,19,Enhanced fault-tolerant quantum computing in $d$-level systems,Earl T Campbell,"Error correcting codes protect quantum information and form the basis of fault tolerant quantum computing. Leading proposals for fault-tolerant quantum computation require codes with an exceedingly rare property, a transverse non-Clifford gate. Codes with the desired property are presented for $d$-level, qudit, systems with prime $d$. The codes use $n=d-1$ qudits and can detect upto $\sim d/3$ errors. We quantify the performance of these codes for one approach to quantum computation, known as magic state distillation. Unlike prior work, we find performance is always enhanced by increasing $d$."
713,1406.1959,2014,10,29,19,Locally restricted measurements on a multipartite quantum system: data hiding is generic,Guillaume Aubrun;Cécilia Lancien,"We study the distinguishability norms associated to families of locally restricted POVMs on multipartite systems. These norms (introduced by Matthews, Wehner and Winter) quantify how quantum measurements, subject to locality constraints, perform in the task of discriminating two multipartite quantum states. We mainly address the following question regarding the behaviour of these distinguishability norms in the high-dimensional regime: On a bipartite space, what are the relative strengths of standard classes of locally restricted measurements? We show that the class of PPT measurements typically performs almost as well as the class of all measurements whereas restricting to local measurements and classical communication, or even just to separable measurements, implies a substantial loss. We also provide examples of state pairs which can be perfectly distinguished by local measurements if (one-way) classical communication is allowed between the parties, but very poorly without it. Finally, we study how many POVMs are needed to distinguish almost perfectly any pair of states on $\mathbf{C}^d$, showing that the answer is $\exp(\Theta(d^2))$."

We can regard such a system as a universal cell with diverse technological uses from communication to large-scale computing, provided that the cell is able to network with others and overcome any noise in the interlinks. Here we show that loss-tolerant entanglement purification makes quantum computing feasible with the noisy and lossy links that are realistic today: With a modestly complex cell design, and using a surface code protocol with a network noise threshold of 13.3%, we find that interlinks which attempt entanglement at a rate of 2MHz but suffer 98% photon loss can result in kilohertz computer clock speeds (i.e. rate of high fidelity stabilizer measurements). Improved links would dramatically increase the clock speed. Our simulations employed local gates of a fidelity already achieved in ion trap devices."
715,1405.2188,2014,6,13,19,Description of quantum coherence in thermodynamic processes requires constraints beyond free energy,Matteo Lostaglio;David Jennings;Terry G Rudolph,"Recent studies have developed fundamental limitations on nanoscale thermodynamics, in terms of a set of independent free energy relations. Here we show that free energy relations cannot properly describe quantum coherence in thermodynamic processes. By casting time-asymmetry as a quantifiable, fundamental resource of a quantum state we arrive at an additional, independent set of thermodynamic constraints that naturally extend the existing ones. These asymmetry relations reveal that the traditional Szilard engine argument does not extend automatically to quantum coherences, but instead only relational coherences in a multipartite scenario can contribute to thermodynamic work. We find that coherence transformations are always irreversible. Our results also reveal additional structural parallels between thermodynamics and the theory of entanglement."

However, the previously best known algorithm to synthesize RUS circuits requires exponential classical runtime. In this paper we present an algorithm to synthesize an RUS circuit to approximate any given single-qubit unitary within precision $\varepsilon$ in probabilistically polynomial classical runtime. Our synthesis approach uses the Clifford+$T$ basis, plus one ancilla qubit and measurement. We provide numerical evidence that our RUS circuits have an expected $T$-count on average $2.5$ times lower than the theoretical lower bound of $3 \log_2 (1/\varepsilon)$ for ancilla-free single-qubit circuit decomposition."

However, the situation seemed to be very different when we deal with exact quantum query complexity. In this paper, we prove that almost all $n$-bit Boolean functions can be computed by an exact quantum algorithm with less than $n$ queries. More exactly, we prove that ${AND}_n$ is the only $n$-bit Boolean function, up to isomorphism, that requires $n$ queries."
719,1403.1121,2014,5,1,19,Spectra and eigenstates of spin chain Hamiltonians,J P Keating;Noah Linden;H J Wells,"We prove that translationally invariant Hamiltonians of a chain of $n$ qubits with nearest-neighbour interactions have two seemingly contradictory features. Firstly in the limit $n\rightarrow\infty$ we show that any translationally invariant Hamiltonian of a chain of $n$ qubits has an eigenbasis such that almost all eigenstates have maximal entanglement between fixed-size sub-blocks of qubits and the rest of the system; in this sense these eigenstates are like those of completely general Hamiltonians (i.e. Hamiltonians with interactions of all orders between arbitrary groups of qubits). Secondly in the limit $n\rightarrow\infty$ we show that any nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian of a chain of $n$ qubits has a Gaussian density of states; thus as far as the eigenvalues are concerned the system is like a non-interacting one. The comparison applies to chains of qubits with translationally invariant nearest-neighbour interactions, but we show that it is extendible to much more general systems (both in terms of the local dimension and the geometry of interaction). Numerical evidence is also presented which suggests that the translational invariance condition may be dropped in the case of nearest-neighbour chains."
720,1402.3108,2014,4,23,19,Breakdown of Surface Code Error Correction Due to Coupling to a Bosonic Bath,Adrian Hutter;Daniel Loss,"We consider a surface code suffering decoherence due to coupling to a bath of bosonic modes at finite temperature and study the time available before the unavoidable breakdown of error correction occurs as a function of coupling and bath parameters. We derive an exact expression for the error rate on each individual qubit of the code, taking spatial and temporal correlations between the errors into account. We investigate numerically how different kinds of spatial correlations between errors in the surface code affect its threshold error rate. This allows us to derive the maximal duration of each quantum error correction period by studying when the single-qubit error rate reaches the corresponding threshold. At the time when error correction breaks down, the error rate in the code can be dominated by the direct coupling of each qubit to the bath, by mediated subluminal interactions, or by mediated superluminal interactions. For a 2D Ohmic bath, the time available per quantum error correction period vanishes in the thermodynamic limit of a large code size $L$ due to induced superluminal interactions, though it does so only like $1/\sqrt{\log L}$. For all other bath types considered, this time remains finite as $L\rightarrow\infty$."

In this work, we give rigorous analytic results on thermalization for translation-invariant quantum lattice systems with finite-range interaction of arbitrary strength, in all cases where there is a unique equilibrium state at the corresponding temperature. We clarify the physical picture by showing that subsystems relax towards the reduction of the global Gibbs state, not the local Gibbs state, if the initial state has close to maximal population entropy and certain non-degeneracy conditions on the spectrum are satisfied. Moreover, we show that almost all pure states with support on a small energy window are locally thermal in the sense of canonical typicality. We derive our results from a statement on equivalence of ensembles generalizing earlier results by Lima, and give numerical and analytic finite-size bounds, relating the Ising model to the finite de Finetti theorem. Furthermore, we prove that global energy eigenstates are locally close to diagonal in the local energy eigenbasis, which constitutes a part of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis that is valid regardless of the integrability of the model."

We show that for any projection game $G$ of entangled value 1-eps < 1, the value of the $k$-fold repetition of G goes to zero as O((1-eps^c)^k), for some universal constant c≥1. Previously parallel repetition with an exponential decay in $k$ was only known for the case of XOR and unique games. To prove the theorem we extend an analytical framework recently introduced by Dinur and Steurer for the study of the classical value of projection games under parallel repetition. Our proof, as theirs, relies on the introduction of a simple relaxation of the entangled value that is perfectly multiplicative. The main technical component of the proof consists in showing that the relaxed value remains tightly connected to the entangled value, thereby establishing the parallel repetition theorem. More generally, we obtain results on the behavior of the entangled value under products of arbitrary (not necessarily identical) projection games. Relating our relaxed value to the entangled value is done by giving an algorithm for converting a relaxed variant of quantum strategies that we call ""vector quantum strategy"" to a quantum strategy. The algorithm is considerably simpler in case the bipartite distribution of questions in the game has good expansion properties. When this is not the case, rounding relies on a quantum analogue of Holenstein's correlated sampling lemma which may be of independent interest. Our ""quantum correlated sampling lemma"" generalizes results of van Dam and Hayden on universal embezzlement."
725,1310.2035,2013,12,6,19,A Survey of Quantum Property Testing,Ashley Montanaro;Ronald de Wolf,"The area of property testing tries to design algorithms that can efficiently handle very large amounts of data: given a large object that either has a certain property or is somehow ""far"" from having that property, a tester should efficiently distinguish between these two cases. In this survey we describe recent results obtained for quantum property testing. This area naturally falls into three parts. First, we may consider quantum testers for properties of classical objects. We survey the main examples known where quantum testers can be much (sometimes exponentially) more efficient than classical testers. Second, we may consider classical testers of quantum objects. This is the situation that arises for instance when one is trying to determine if quantum states or operations do what they are supposed to do, based only on classical input-output behavior. Finally, we may also consider quantum testers for properties of quantum objects, such as states or operations. We survey known bounds on testing various natural properties, such as whether two states are equal, whether a state is separable, whether two operations commute, etc. We also highlight connections to other areas of quantum information theory and mention a number of open questions."
726,1309.3789,2013,11,4,19,An area law for entanglement from exponential decay of correlations,Fernando G S L Brandão;Michał Horodecki,"Area laws for entanglement in quantum many-body systems give useful information about their low-temperature behaviour and are tightly connected to the possibility of good numerical simulations. An intuition from quantum many-body physics suggests that an area law should hold whenever there is exponential decay of correlations in the system, a property found, for instance, in non-critical phases of matter. However, the existence of quantum data-hiding state--that is, states having very small correlations, yet a volume scaling of entanglement--was believed to be a serious obstruction to such an implication. Here we prove that notwithstanding the phenomenon of data hiding, one-dimensional quantum many-body states satisfying exponential decay of correlations always fulfil an area law. To obtain this result we combine several recent advances in quantum information theory, thus showing the usefulness of the field for addressing problems in other areas of physics."
727,1309.2680,2013,10,16,19,Self-Correcting Quantum Memories Beyond the Percolation Threshold,Matthew B Hastings;Grant H Watson;Roger G Melko,"We analyze several high dimensional generalizations of the toric code at nonzero temperature. We find that in large enough dimension, there can be a distinct separation between the critical temperature $T_c$, given by thermodynamic singularities, and the percolation temperature $T_p$, given by the percolation of defects. We argue that the regime $T_p<T<T_c$ is a range of temperatures where a self-correcting quantum memory can operate despite having percolating defects. We present analytic arguments and numerical evidence in support of this scenario, including a mean-field treatment and Monte Carlo simulations. Near $T_c$, simulations observe a large hysteretic behavior, which may have applications by allowing the self-correcting phase to survive in a ""superheated"" regime."

729,1305.0848,2013,9,17,19,Bound entangled states with a private key and their classical counterpart,Maris Ozols;Graeme Smith;John A Smolin,"Entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing. In its pure form, it allows quantum teleportation and sharing classical secrets. Realistic quantum states are noisy and their usefulness is only partially understood. Bound-entangled states are central to this question---they have no distillable entanglement, yet sometimes still have a private classical key. We present a construction of bound-entangled states with private key based on classical probability distributions. From this emerge states possessing a new classical analogue of bound entanglement, distinct from the long-sought bound information. We also find states of smaller dimensions and higher key rates than previously known. Our construction has implications for classical cryptography: we show that existing protocols are insufficient for extracting private key from our distributions due to their ""bound-entangled"" nature. We propose a simple extension of existing protocols that can extract key from them."
730,1302.6245,2013,9,12,19,Quantum Computation of Prime Number Functions,Jose I Latorre;German Sierra,"We propose a quantum circuit that creates a pure state corresponding to the quantum superposition of all prime numbers less than 2^n, where n is the number of qubits of the register. This Prime state can be built using Grover's algorithm, whose oracle is a quantum implementation of the classical Miller-Rabin primality test. The Prime state is highly entangled, and its entanglement measures encode number theoretical functions such as the distribution of twin primes or the Chebyshev bias. This algorithm can be further combined with the quantum Fourier transform to yield an estimate of the prime counting function, more efficiently than any classical algorithm and with an error below the bound that allows for the verification of the Riemann hypothesis. We also propose a Twin Prime state to measure the number of twin primes and another state to test the Goldbach conjecture. Arithmetic properties of prime numbers are then, in principle, amenable to experimental verifications on quantum systems."
731,1302.1242,2013,6,4,19,Three-player entangled XOR games are NP-hard to approximate,Thomas Vidick,"We show that for any eps>0 the problem of finding a factor (2-eps) approximation to the entangled value of a three-player XOR game is NP-hard. Equivalently, the problem of approximating the largest possible quantum violation of a tripartite Bell correlation inequality to within any multiplicative constant is NP-hard. These results are the first constant-factor hardness of approximation results for entangled games or quantum violations of Bell inequalities shown under the sole assumption that P ≠NP. They can be thought of as an extension of Hastad's optimal hardness of approximation results for MAX-E3-LIN2 (JACM'01) to the entangled-player setting. The key technical component of our work is a soundness analysis of a point-vs-plane low-degree test against entangled players. This extends and simplifies the analysis of the multilinearity test by Ito and Vidick (FOCS'12). Our results demonstrate the possibility for efficient reductions between entangled-player games and our techniques may lead to further hardness of approximation results."
732,1301.1162,2013,5,7,19,An area law and sub-exponential algorithm for 1D systems,Itai Arad;Alexei Kitaev;Zeph Landau;Umesh Vazirani,"We give a new proof for the area law for general 1D gapped systems, which exponentially improves Hastings' famous result \citeref:Has07. Specifically, we show that for a chain of d-dimensional spins, governed by a 1D local Hamiltonian with a spectral gap \eps>0, the entanglement entropy of the ground state with respect to any cut in the chain is upper bounded by $O{\frac{\log^3 d}{\eps}}$. Our approach uses the framework Arad et al to construct a Chebyshev-based AGSP (Approximate Ground Space Projection) with favorable factors. However, our construction uses the Hamiltonian directly, instead of using the Detectability lemma, which allows us to work with general (frustrated) Hamiltonians, as well as slightly improving the $1/\eps$ dependence of the bound in Arad et al. To achieve that, we establish a new, ""random-walk like"", bound on the entanglement rank of an arbitrary power of a 1D Hamiltonian, which might be of independent interest: \ERH^\ell \le (\ell d)^O(\sqrt\ell). Finally, treating d as a constant, our AGSP shows that the ground state is well approximated by a matrix product state with a sublinear bond dimension $B=e^O(\log^3/4n/\eps^1/4). Using this in conjunction with known dynamical programing algorithms, yields an algorithm for a 1/\poly(n) approximation of the ground energy with a subexponential running time T\le \exp(e^O(\log^3/4n/\eps^1/4))."

Such problems are believed to be difficult to solve, even with a quantum computer, but have the property that if a purported solution to the problem is given, a quantum computer would easily be able to verify whether it is correct. An attempt has been made to make this paper as self-contained as possible so that it can be accessible to computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians, and quantum chemists. Problems of interest to all of these professions can be found here."
734,1210.1810,2012,2,7,19,Fully device independent quantum key distribution,Umesh Vazirani;Thomas Vidick,"The laws of quantum mechanics allow unconditionally secure key distribution protocols. Nevertheless, security proofs of traditional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols rely on a crucial assumption, the trustworthiness of the quantum devices used in the protocol. In device-independent QKD, even this last assumption is relaxed: the devices used in the protocol may have been adversarially prepared, and there is no a priori guarantee that they perform according to specification. Proving security in this setting had been a central open problem in quantum cryptography. We give the first device-independent proof of security of a protocol for quantum key distribution that guarantees the extraction of a linear amount of key even when the devices are subject to a constant rate of noise. Our only assumptions are that the laboratories in which each party holds his or her own device are spatially isolated, and that both devices, as well as the eavesdropper, are bound by the laws of quantum mechanics. All previous proofs of security relied either on the use of many independent pairs of devices, or on the absence of noise."
735,1209.1055,2012,1,8,19,Hardness of approximation for quantum problems,Sevag Gharibian;Julia Kempe,"The polynomial hierarchy plays a central role in classical complexity theory. Here, we define a quantum generalization of the polynomial hierarchy, and initiate its study. We show that not only are there natural complete problems for the second level of this quantum hierarchy, but that these problems are in fact hard to approximate. Using these techniques, we also obtain hardness of approximation for the class QCMA. Our approach is based on the use of dispersers, and is inspired by the classical results of Umans regarding hardness of approximation for the second level of the classical polynomial hierarchy [Umans, FOCS 1999]. The problems for which we prove hardness of approximation for include, among others, a quantum version of the Succinct Set Cover problem, and a variant of the local Hamiltonian problem with hybrid classical-quantum ground states."

The primary aim of the paper is to turn the magic into an algebra by setting a precise bound to the degree a given electron density can affect spins. An application of the resulting spin-orbital Pauli constraints to Fe, Co, and Ni provides a new insight into the origin of magnetic moments in this archetypical ferromagnets."
737,1612.02051,2016,10,8,18,Heisenberg Uncertainty Relations: An Operational Approach,Joseph M Renes;Volkher B Scholz;Stefan Huber,"The notions of error and disturbance appearing in quantum uncertainty relations are often quantified by the discrepancy of a physical quantity from its ideal value. However, these real and ideal values are not the outcomes of simultaneous measurements, and comparing the values of unmeasured observables is not necessarily meaningful according to quantum theory. To overcome these conceptual difficulties, we take a different approach and define error and disturbance in an operational manner. In particular, we formulate both in terms of the probability that one can successfully distinguish the actual measurement device from the relevant hypothetical ideal by any experimental test whatsoever. This definition itself does not rely on the formalism of quantum theory, avoiding many of the conceptual difficulties of usual definitions. We then derive new Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations for both joint measurability and the error-disturbance tradeoff for arbitrary observables of finite-dimensional systems, as well as for the case of position and momentum. Our relations may be directly applied in information processing settings, for example to infer that devices which can faithfully transmit information regarding one observable do not leak any information about conjugate observables to the environment. We also show that Englert's wave-particle duality relation [PRL 77, 2154 (1996)] can be viewed as an error-disturbance uncertainty relation."

In this article quantitative bounds on the fraction of positive maps that are completely positive are proved. A main tool are real algebraic geometry techniques developed by Blekherman to study the gap between positive polynomials and sums of squares. Finally, an algorithm to produce positive maps which are not completely positive is given."
739,1610.05190,2016,11,26,18,Quantum enhancement of randomness distribution,Raúl García-Patrón;William Matthews;Andreas Winter,"The capability of a given channel to communicate information is, a priori, distinct from its capability to distribute shared randomness. In this article we define randomness distribution capacities of quantum channels assisted by forward, back, or two-way classical communication and compare these to the corresponding communication capacities. With forward assistance or no assistance, we find that they are equal. We establish the mutual information of the channel as an upper bound on the two-way assisted randomness distribution capacity. This implies that all of the capacities are equal for classical-quantum channels. On the other hand, we show that the back-assisted randomness distribution capacity of a quantum-classical channels is equal to its mutual information. This is often strictly greater than the back-assisted communication capacity. We give an explicit example of such a separation where the randomness distribution protocol is noiseless."
740,1610.05140,2016,12,8,18,Certified randomness between mistrustful players,Carl A Miller;Yaoyun Shi,"It is known that if two players achieve a superclassical score at a nonlocal game $G$, then their outputs are certifiably random - that is, regardless of the strategy used by the players, a third party will not be able to perfectly predict their outputs (even if he were given their inputs). We prove that for any complete-support game $G$, there is an explicit nonzero function $F_G$ such that if Alice and Bob achieve a superclassical score of $s$ at $G$, then Bob has a probability of at most $1 - F_G ( s )$ of correctly guessing Alice's output after the game is played. Our result implies that certifying global randomness through such games must necessarily introduce local randomness."

We show that for 5 or more qubits, except for a set of states of zero measure, the stabilizer group of multipartite entangled states is trivial; that is, containing only the identity element. We use this result to show that for 5 or more qubits, the action of deterministic local operations and classical communication (LOCC) can almost always be simulated simply by local unitary (LU) operations. This proves that almost all n-qubit states with n>4 are isolated, that is they can neither be reached nor converted into any other (n-partite entangled), LU-inequivalent state via deterministic LOCC. We also find a simple and elegant expression for the maximal probability to convert one multi-qubit entangled state to another for this generic set of states."

We provide an introduction to the concept of entanglement entropy in quantum field theories, review the holographic proposals for computing the same, providing some justification for where these proposals arise from in the first two parts. The final part addresses recent developments linking entanglement and geometry. We provide an overview of the various arguments and technical developments that teach us how to use field theory entanglement to detect geometry. Our discussion is by design eclectic; we have chosen to focus on developments that appear to us most promising for further insights into the holographic map. This is a preliminary draft of a few chapters of a book which will appear sometime in the near future, to be published by Springer. The book in addition contains a discussion of application of holographic ideas to computation of entanglement entropy in strongly coupled field theories, and discussion of tensor networks and holography, which we have chosen to exclude from the current manuscript."

We first consider the multi-objective optimization problem of matching observed data while minimizing the causal effect of nonlocal variables and prove an inequality for the optimal region that both strengthens and generalizes Bell's theorem. To solve the optimization problem (rather than simply bound it), we develop a novel genetic algorithm treating as individuals causal networks. By applying our algorithm to a photonic Bell experiment, we demonstrate the trade-off between the quantitative relaxation of one or more local causality assumptions and the ability of data to match quantum correlations."
744,1608.00374,2016,9,7,18,Error regions in quantum state tomography: computational complexity caused by geometry of quantum states,Daniel Suess;Łukasz Rudnicki;David Gross,"The outcomes of quantum mechanical experiments are inherently random. It is therefore necessary to develop stringent methods for quantifying the degree of statistical uncertainty about the results of quantum experiments. For the particularly relevant task of quantum state estimation, it has been shown that a significant reduction in uncertainty can be achieved by taking the positivity of quantum states into account. However -- the large number of partial results and heuristics notwithstanding -- no efficient general algorithm is known that produces an optimal uncertainty region from experimental data and the prior constraint of positivity. Here, we make this problem precise and show that the general case is NP-hard. Our result leaves room for the existence of efficient approximate solutions, and therefore does not yet imply that the practical task of quantum uncertainty quantification is intractable. However, it does show that there exists a non-trivial trade-off between optimality and computational efficiency for error regions. We prove two versions of the result: One for frequentist and one for Bayesian statistics."
745,1607.05285,2016,8,12,18,Schur complement inequalities for covariance matrices and monogamy of quantum correlations,Ludovico Lami;Christoph Hirche;Gerardo Adesso;Andreas Winter,"We derive fundamental constraints for the Schur complement of positive matrices, which provide an operator strengthening to recently established information inequalities for quantum covariance matrices, including strong subadditivity. This allows us to prove general results on the monogamy of entanglement and steering quantifiers in continuous variable systems with an arbitrary number of modes per party. A powerful hierarchical relation for correlation measures based on the log-determinant of covariance matrices is further established for all Gaussian states, which has no counterpart among quantities based on the conventional von Neumann entropy."
746,1607.05262,2016,8,2,18,Thermal states minimize the output entropy of single-mode phase-insensitive Gaussian channels with an input entropy constraint,Haoyu Qi;Mark M Wilde;Saikat Guha,"Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI), $e^{2h(X+Y)} \ge e^{2h(X)} + e^{2h(Y)}$ for independent continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$, with $h(X)$ the differential entropy of $X$, has found many applications in Gaussian channel coding theorems. Equality holds iff both $X$ and $Y$ are Gaussian. For all the major applications of the EPI, it suffices to restrict $Y$ to be Gaussian. The statement of this restricted EPI is that given a lower bound on $h(X)$, where $X$ is input to the Gaussian noise channel $Z = X+Y$, a Gaussian input $X$ minimizes $h(Z)$, the output entropy. The conjectured Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI) takes on a role analogous to Shannon's EPI in proving coding theorem converses involving quantum limits of classical communications over bosonic channels. Similar to the classical case, a restricted version of the EPnI suffices for all its applications, where one of the two states is restricted to be a thermal state---a state that has a zero-mean, circularly-symmetric, complex Gaussian distribution in phase space. The statement of this restricted EPnI is that, given a lower bound on the von Neumann entropy of the input to an $n$-mode lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, an $n$-mode product thermal state input minimizes the output entropy. In this paper, we provide a proof that the thermal state input minimizes the output entropy of an arbitrary single-mode phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channel subject to an input entropy constraint. This subsumes the $n=1$ case of the aforesaid restricted version of the EPnI. Our results imply that triple trade-off and broadcast capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels are now solved. However, due to an additivity issue, several bosonic-channel coding-theorem proofs require a stronger multi-channel-use ($n>1$) version of the restricted version of the EPnI we prove in this paper, a proof of which remains open."
747,1607.04833,2016,7,20,18,Belief propagation decoding of quantum channels by passing quantum messages,Joseph M Renes,"Belief propagation is a powerful tool in statistical physics, machine learning, and modern coding theory. As a decoding method, it is ubiquitous in classical error correction and has also been applied to stabilizer-based quantum error correction. The algorithm works by passing messages between nodes of the factor graph associated with the code and enables efficient decoding, in some cases even up to the Shannon capacity of the channel. Here we construct a belief propagation algorithm which passes quantum messages on the factor graph and is capable of decoding the classical-quantum channel with pure state outputs. This gives explicit decoding circuits whose number of gates is quadratic in the blocklength of the code. We also show that this decoder can be modified to work with polar codes for the pure state channel and as part of a polar decoder for transmitting quantum information over the amplitude damping channel. These represent the first explicit capacity-achieving decoders for non-Pauli channels."
748,1607.04591,2016,7,19,18,Autonomous quantum machines and finite sized clocks,Mischa P Woods;Ralph Silva;Jonathan Oppenheim,"Processes such as quantum computation, or the evolution of quantum cellular automata are typically described by a unitary operation implemented by an external observer. In particular, an interaction is generally turned on for a precise amount of time, using a classical clock. A fully quantum mechanical description of such a device would include a quantum description of the clock whose state is generally disturbed because of the back-reaction on it. Such a description is needed if we wish to consider finite sized autonomous quantum machines requiring no external control. The extent of the back-reaction has implications on how small the device can be, on the length of time the device can run, and is required if we want to understand what a fully quantum mechanical treatment of an observer would look like. Here, we consider the implementation of a unitary by a finite sized device, and show that the back-reaction on it can be made exponentially small in the device's dimension with only a linear increase in energy. As a result, an autonomous quantum machine need only be of modest size. We are also able to solve a long-standing open problem by using a finite sized quantum clock to approximate the continuous evolution of an idealised clock. The result has implications on the equivalence of different paradigms of quantum thermodynamics, some which allow external control and some which only allow autonomous thermal machines."
749,1605.07084,2016,7,19,18,Low-Sensitivity Functions from Unambiguous Certificates,Shalev Ben-David,"We provide new query complexity separations against sensitivity for total Boolean functions: a power 3 separation between deterministic (and even randomized or quantum) query complexity and sensitivity, and a power 2.1 separation between certificate complexity and sensitivity. We get these separations by using a new connection between sensitivity and a seemingly unrelated measure called one-sided unambiguous certificate complexity ($UC_{\min}$). Finally, we show that $UC_{\min}$ is lower-bounded by fractional block sensitivity, which means we cannot use these techniques to get a super-quadratic separation between bs(f) and s(f)."
750,1605.04914,2016,7,18,18,Flexible quantum circuits using scalable continuous-variable cluster states,Rafael N Alexander;Nicolas C Menicucci,"We show that measurement-based quantum computation on scalable continuous-variable (CV) cluster states admits more quantum-circuit flexibility and compactness than similar protocols for standard square-lattice CV cluster states. This advantage is a direct result of the macronode structure of these states---that is, a lattice structure in which each graph node actually consists of several physical modes. These extra modes provide additional measurement degrees of freedom at each graph location, which can be used to manipulate the flow and processing of quantum information more robustly and with additional flexibility that is not available on an ordinary lattice."
751,1604.05438,2016,5,24,18,Covert Quantum Communication,Juan Miguel Arrazola;Valerio Scarani,"We extend covert communication to the quantum regime by showing that covert quantum communication is possible over optical channels with noise arising either from the environment or from the sender's lab. In particular, we show that sequences of qubits can be transmitted covertly by using both a single photon and a coherent state encoding. We study the possibility of performing covert quantum key distribution and show that positive key rates and covertness can be achieved simultaneously. Covert communication requires a secret key between sender and receiver, which raises the problem of how this key can be regenerated covertly. We show that covert QKD consumes more key than it can generate and propose instead a hybrid protocol for covert key regeneration that uses pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) together with covert QKD to regenerate secret keys. The security of the new key is guaranteed by QKD while the security of the covert communication is at least as strong as the security of the PRNG."

Numerically, their theoretical error threshold can be calculated by mapping the underlying quantum problem to a related classical statistical-mechanical spin system with quenched disorder. Here, we present results for the general fault-tolerant regime, where we consider both qubit and measurement errors. However, unlike in previous studies, here we vary the strength of the different error sources independently. Our results highlight peculiar differences between toric and color codes. This study complements previous results published in New J. Phys. 13, 083006 (2011)."
753,1603.05970,2016,4,20,18,Coherent state contellations and polar codes for Bosonic Gaussian channels,Felipe G Lacerda;Joseph M Renes;Volkher B Scholz,"Optical communication channels are ultimately quantum-mechanical in nature, and we must therefore look beyond classical information theory to determine their communication capacity as well as to find efficient encoding and decoding schemes of the highest rates. Thermal channels, which arise from linear coupling of the field to a thermal environment, are of particular practical relevance; their classical capacity has been recently established, but their quantum capacity remains unknown. While the capacity sets the ultimate limit on reliable communication rates, it does not promise that such rates are achievable by practical means. Here we construct efficiently-encodable codes for thermal channels which achieve the classical capacity and the so-called Gaussian coherent information for transmission of classical and quantum information, respectively. Our codes are based on combining polar codes with a discretization of the channel input into a finite ""constellation"" of coherent states. Encoding of classical information can be done using linear optics."
754,1602.08049,2016,3,30,18,How to quantify coherence: Distinguishing speakable and unspeakable notions,Iman Marvian;Robert W Spekkens,"Quantum coherence is a critical resource for many operational tasks. Understanding how to quantify and manipulate it also promises to have applications for a diverse set of problems in theoretical physics. For certain applications, however, one requires coherence between the eigenspaces of specific physical observables, such as energy, angular momentum, or photon number, and it makes a difference which eigenspaces appear in the superposition. For others, there is a preferred set of subspaces relative to which coherence is deemed a resource, but it is irrelevant which of the subspaces appear in the superposition. We term these two types of coherence unspeakable and speakable respectively. We argue that a useful approach to quantifying and characterizing unspeakable coherence is provided by the resource theory of asymmetry when the symmetry group is a group of translations, and we translate a number of prior results on asymmetry into the language of coherence. We also highlight some of the applications of this approach, for instance, in the context of quantum metrology, quantum speed limits, quantum thermodynamics, and NMR. The question of how best to treat speakable coherence as a resource is also considered. We review a popular approach in terms of operations that preserve the set of incoherent states, propose an alternative approach in terms of operations that are covariant under dephasing, and we outline the challenge of providing a physical justification for either approach. Finally, we note some mathematical connections that hold among the different approaches to quantifying coherence."

These 'binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite superposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial codes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in bosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and displacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform approximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between error detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error recovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The binomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means of measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of the binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes with even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes are related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of requiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as the ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to 'cat codes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several advantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate orthonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are realizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should prove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories, photonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and down-conversion."

We adopt a fully quantum mechanical and information theoretic description of thermodynamics and include a work system whose energy is allowed to fluctuate. We derive a generalisation of Gibbs-stochasticity, a condition found in the approach to thermodynamics inspired by quantum information theory. We show that this generalisation gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a thermodynamical transition to happen in the case of fluctuation work. The condition serves as a parent equation which can be used to derive a number of results. These include writing the second law of thermodynamics as an equality featuring a fine-grained notion of the free energy. We also obtain a generalisation of the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem which holds for arbitrary initial states. We further show that each of these three relations can be seen as the quasi-classical limit of three fully quantum identities. This allows us to consider the free energy as an operator, and allows one to obtain more general and fully quantum fluctuation relations from the information theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics."

The cornerstone of our approach is a generalization of the Choi isomorphism that allows one to efficiently represent any given Quantum Network in terms of a single positive operator. Our formalism allows one to face and solve many quantum information processing problems that would be hardly manageable otherwise, the most relevant of which are reviewed in this work: quantum process tomography, quantum cloning and learning of transformations, inversion of a unitary gate, information-disturbance tradeoff in estimating a unitary transformation, cloning and learning of a measurement device."
758,1601.03226,2016,1,25,18,Strong subadditivity for log-determinant of covariance matrices and its applications,Gerardo Adesso;R Simon,We prove that the log-determinant of the covariance matrix obeys the strong subadditivity inequality for arbitrary tripartite states of multimode continuous variable quantum systems. This establishes general limitations on the distribution of information encoded in the second moments of canonically conjugate operators. The inequality is shown to be stronger than the conventional strong subadditivity inequality for von Neumann entropy in a class of pure tripartite Gaussian states. We finally show that such an inequality implies a strict monogamy-type constraint for joint Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability of single modes by Gaussian measurements performed on multiple groups of modes.
759,1601.00470,2016,1,20,18,Matrix product approximations to multipoint functions in two-dimensional conformal field theory,Robert Koenig;Volkher B Scholz,"Matrix product states (MPS) illustrate the suitability of tensor networks for the description of interacting many-body systems: ground states of gapped $1$-D systems are approximable by MPS as shown by Hastings [J. Stat. Mech. Theor. Exp., P08024 (2007)]. In contrast, whether MPS and more general tensor networks can accurately reproduce correlations in critical quantum systems, respectively quantum field theories, has not been established rigorously. Ample evidence exists: entropic considerations provide restrictions on the form of suitable Ansatz states, and numerical studies show that certain tensor networks can indeed approximate the associated correlation functions. Here we provide a complete positive answer to this question in the case of MPS and $2D$ conformal field theory: we give quantitative estimates for the approximation error when approximating correlation functions by MPS. Our work is constructive and yields an explicit MPS, thus providing both suitable initial values as well as a rigorous justification of variational methods."

761,1511.04288,2015,1,5,18,Tensor networks for gauge field theories,Boye Buyens;Jutho Haegeman;Frank Verstraete;Karel Van Acoleyen,Over the last decade tensor network states (TNS) have emerged as a powerful tool for the study of quantum many body systems. The matrix product states (MPS) are one particular class of TNS and are used for the simulation of (1+1)-dimensional systems. In this proceeding we use MPS to determine the elementary excitations of the Schwinger model in the presence of an electric background field. We obtain an estimate for the value of the background field where the one-particle excitation with the largest energy becomes unstable and decays into two other elementary particles with smaller energy.
762,1511.00267,2015,12,17,18,Entropic uncertainty and measurement reversibility,Mario Berta;Stephanie Wehner;Mark M Wilde,"The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum side information (EUR-QSI) from [Berta et al., Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] is a unifying principle relating two distinctive features of quantum mechanics: quantum uncertainty due to measurement incompatibility, and entanglement. In these relations, quantum uncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two incompatible measurements is applied. In particular, the ""uncertainty witness"" lower bound in the EUR-QSI is not a function of a post-measurement state. An insightful proof of the EUR-QSI from [Coles et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 210405 (2012)] makes use of a fundamental mathematical consequence of the postulates of quantum mechanics known as the non-increase of quantum relative entropy under quantum channels. Here, we exploit this perspective to establish a tightening of the EUR-QSI which adds a new state-dependent term in the lower bound, related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement. As such, this new term is a direct function of the post-measurement state and can be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement causes. Our result thus quantitatively unifies this feature of quantum mechanics with the others mentioned above. We have experimentally tested our theoretical predictions on the IBM Quantum Experience and find reasonable agreement between our predictions and experimental outcomes."
763,1510.07233,2015,11,16,18,(Nearly) optimal P-values for all Bell inequalities,David Elkouss;Stephanie Wehner,"A key objective in conducting a Bell test is to quantify the statistical evidence against a local-hidden variable model (LHVM) given that we can collect only a finite number of trials in any experiment. The notion of statistical evidence is thereby formulated in the framework of hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis is that the experiment can be described by an LHVM. The statistical confidence with which the null hypothesis of an LHVM is rejected is quantified by the so-called P-value, where a smaller P-value implies higher confidence. Establishing good statistical evidence is especially challenging if the number of trials is small, or the Bell violation very low. Here, we derive the optimal P-value for a large class of Bell inequalities. What's more, we obtain very sharp upper bounds on the P-value for all Bell inequalities. These values are easily computed from experimental data, and are valid even if we allow arbitrary memory in the devices. Our analysis is able to deal with imperfect random number generators, and event-ready schemes, even if such a scheme can create different kinds of entangled states. Finally, we review requirements for sound data collection, and a method for combining P-values of independent Bell experiments."

This model allows security to be achieved by sending more quantum signals than an attacker can reliably store at one specific point during the protocol. Concretely, we determine how many signals need to be sent in order to achieve security by establishing a trade-off between quantum uncertainty generated in the protocol and the classical capacity of the memory channel. As our main technical tool, we study and derive new uncertainty relations for continuous-variable systems. Finally, we provide explicit security parameters for realistic memory models."

Using these tools, we develop the first provably efficient quantum algorithm for finding hidden subhypergroups of nilpotent abelian hypergroups and, via the aforementioned connection, a new, hypergroup-based algorithm for the HNSP on nilpotent groups. We also give efficient methods for manipulating non-unitary, non-monomial stabilizers and an adaptive Fourier sampling technique of general interest."
766,1509.05032,2015,10,1,18,Reducing the overhead for quantum computation when noise is biased,Paul Webster;Stephen D Bartlett;David Poulin,"We analyse a model for fault-tolerant quantum computation with low overhead suitable for situations where the noise is biased. The basis for this scheme is a gadget for the fault-tolerant preparation of magic states that enable universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using only Clifford gates that preserve the noise bias. We analyse the distillation of $|T\rangle$-type magic states using this gadget at the physical level, followed by concatenation with the 15-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code, and comparing our results with standard constructions. In the regime where the noise bias (rate of Pauli $Z$ errors relative to other single-qubit errors) is greater than a factor of 10, our scheme has lower overhead across a broad range of relevant noise rates."

Fuelled by experimental advances and the potential of future nanoscale applications this research effort is pursued by scientists with different backgrounds, including statistical physics, many-body theory, mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory, who bring various tools and methods to the field. A multitude of theoretical questions are being addressed ranging from issues of thermalisation of quantum systems and various definitions of ""work"", to the efficiency and power of quantum engines.

768,1507.06904,2015,8,26,18,Fisher-symmetric informationally complete measurements for pure states,Nan Li;Christopher Ferrie;Jonathan A Gross;Amir Kalev;Carlton M Caves,"We introduce a new kind of quantum measurement that is defined to be symmetric in the sense of uniform Fisher information across a set of parameters that injectively represent pure quantum states in the neighborhood of a fiducial pure state. The measurement is locally informationally complete---i.e., it uniquely determines these parameters, as opposed to distinguishing two arbitrary quantum states---and it is maximal in the sense of a multi-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound. For a $d$-dimensional quantum system, requiring only local informational completeness allows us to reduce the number of outcomes of the measurement from a minimum close to but below $4d-3$, for the usual notion of global pure-state informational completeness, to $2d-1$."
769,1507.06038,2015,7,27,18,Quantum data hiding in the presence of noise,Cosmo Lupo;Mark M Wilde;Seth Lloyd,"When classical or quantum information is broadcast to separate receivers, there exist codes that encrypt the encoded data such that the receivers cannot recover it when performing local operations and classical communication, but they can decode reliably if they bring their systems together and perform a collective measurement. This phenomenon is known as quantum data hiding and hitherto has been studied under the assumption that noise does not affect the encoded systems. With the aim of applying the quantum data hiding effect in practical scenarios, here we define the data-hiding capacity for hiding classical information using a quantum channel. Using this notion, we establish a regularized upper bound on the data hiding capacity of any quantum broadcast channel, and we prove that coherent-state encodings have a strong limitation on their data hiding rates. We then prove a lower bound on the data hiding capacity of channels that map the maximally mixed state to the maximally mixed state (we call these channels ""mictodiactic""---they can be seen as a generalization of unital channels when the input and output spaces are not necessarily isomorphic) and argue how to extend this bound to generic channels and to more than two receivers."
770,1506.04325,2015,7,23,18,Polynomial Bell inequalities,Rafael Chaves,"It is a recent realization that many of the concepts and tools of causal discovery in machine learning are highly relevant to problems in quantum information, in particular quantum nonlocality. The crucial ingredient in the connection between both fields is the tool of Bayesian networks, a graphical model used to reason about probabilistic causation. Indeed, Bell's theorem concerns a particular kind of a Bayesian network and Bell inequalities are a special case of linear constraints following from such models. It is thus natural to look for generalized Bell scenarios involving more complex Bayesian networks. The problem, however, relies on the fact that such generalized scenarios are characterized by polynomial Bell inequalities and no current method is available to derive them beyond very simple cases. In this work, we make a significant step in that direction, providing a general and practical method for the derivation of polynomial Bell inequalities in a wide class of scenarios, applying it to a few cases of interest. We also show how our construction naturally gives rise to a notion of non-signalling in generalized networks."

Here, we show that at the nano and quantum scale, this law needs to be revised in the sense that more information about the bath other than its temperature is required to decide whether maximum efficiency can be achieved. In particular, we derive new fundamental limitations of the efficiency of heat engines at the nano and quantum scale that show that the Carnot efficiency can only be achieved under special circumstances, and we derive a new maximum efficiency for others."
772,1506.00985,2015,6,9,18,Measurement-based Quantum Communication,Michael Zwerger;Hans J Briegel;Wolfgang Dür,"We review and discuss the potential of using measurement-based elements in quantum communication schemes, where certain tasks are realized with the help of entangled resource states that are processed by measurements. We consider long-range quantum communication based on the transmission of encoded quantum states, where encoding, decoding and syndrome read-out are implemented using small-scale resource states. We also discuss entanglement-based schemes and consider measurement-based quantum repeaters. An important element in these schemes is entanglement purification, which can also be implemented in a measurement-based way. We analyze the influence of noise and imperfections in these schemes, and show that measurement-based implementation allows for very large error thresholds of the order of 10\% noise per qubit and more. We show how to obtain optimal resource states for different tasks, and discuss first experimental realizations of measurement-based quantum error correction using trapped ions and photons."
773,1505.06244,2015,6,3,18,An experimental test of noncontextuality without unwarranted idealizations,Michael D Mazurek;Matthew F Pusey;Ravi Kunjwal;Kevin J Resch;Robert W Spekkens,"To make precise the sense in which nature fails to respect classical physics, one requires a formal notion of classicality. Ideally, such a notion should be defined operationally, so that it can be subjected to a direct experimental test, and it should be applicable in a wide variety of experimental scenarios, so that it can cover the breadth of phenomena that are thought to defy classical understanding. Bell's notion of local causality fulfills the first criterion but not the second. The notion of noncontextuality fulfills the second criterion, but it is a long-standing question whether it can be made to fulfill the first. Previous attempts to experimentally test noncontextuality have all presumed certain idealizations that do not hold in real experiments, namely, noiseless measurements and exact operational equivalences. We here show how to devise tests that are free of these idealizations. We also perform a photonic implementation of one such test that rules out noncontextual models with high confidence."
774,1504.05965,2015,5,26,18,Qutrit Magic State Distillation Tight in Some Directions,Hillary Dawkins;Mark Howard,"Magic state distillation is a crucial component in the leading approaches to implementing universal fault tolerant quantum computation, with existing protocols for both qubit and higher dimensional systems. Early work focused on determining the region of distillable states for qubit protocols, yet comparatively little is known about which states can be distilled and with what distillable region for d>2. Here we focus on d=3 and present new four-qutrit distillation schemes that improve upon the known distillable region, and achieve distillation tight to the boundary of undistillable states for some classes of state. As a consequence of recent results, this implies that there is a family of quantum states that enable universality if and only if they exhibit contextuality with respect to stabilizer measurements. We also identify a new routine whose fixed point is a magic state with maximal sum-negativity i.e., it is maximally non-stabilizer in a specific sense."
775,1504.02395,2015,4,24,18,Bridging the gap between general probabilistic theories and the device-independent framework for nonlocality and contextuality,Giulio Chiribella;Xiao Yuan,"Characterizing quantum correlations in terms of information-theoretic principles is a popular chapter of quantum foundations. Traditionally, the principles adopted for this scope have been expressed in terms of conditional probability distributions, specifying the probability that a black box produces a certain output upon receiving a certain input. This framework is known as ""device-independent"". Another major chapter of quantum foundations is the information-theoretic characterization of quantum theory, with its sets of states and measurements, and with its allowed dynamics. The different frameworks adopted for this scope are known under the umbrella term ""general probabilistic theories"". With only a few exceptions, the two programmes on characterizing quantum correlations and characterizing quantum theory have so far proceeded on separate tracks, each one developing its own methods and its own agenda. This paper aims at bridging the gap, by comparing the two frameworks and illustrating how the two programmes can benefit each other."

Generalizing such measures based on the Rényi entropies is expected to enhance their scope in applications. We prescribe Rényi generalizations for any quantum information measure which consists of a linear combination of von Neumann entropies with coefficients chosen from the set -1,0,1. As examples, we describe Rényi generalizations of the conditional quantum mutual information, some quantum multipartite information measures, and the topological entanglement entropy. Among these, we discuss the various properties of the Rényi conditional quantum mutual information and sketch some potential applications. We conjecture that the proposed Rényi conditional quantum mutual informations are monotone increasing in the Rényi parameter, and we have proofs of this conjecture for some special cases."
777,1501.03202,2015,3,2,18,No Return to Classical Reality,David Jennings;Matthew S Leifer,"At a fundamental level, the classical picture of the world is dead, and has been dead now for almost a century. Pinning down exactly which quantum phenomena are responsible for this has proved to be a tricky and controversial question, but a lot of progress has been made in the past few decades. We now have a range of precise statements showing that whatever the ultimate laws of Nature are, they cannot be classical. In this article, we review results on the fundamental phenomena of quantum theory that cannot be understood in classical terms. We proceed by first granting quite a broad notion of classicality, describe a range of quantum phenomena (such as randomness, discreteness, the indistinguishability of states, measurement-uncertainty, measurement-disturbance, complementarity, noncommutativity, interference, the no-cloning theorem, and the collapse of the wave-packet) that do fall under its liberal scope, and then finally describe some aspects of quantum physics that can never admit a classical understanding -- the intrinsically quantum mechanical aspects of Nature. The most famous of these is Bell's theorem, but we also review two more recent results in this area. Firstly, Hardy's theorem shows that even a finite dimensional quantum system must contain an infinite amount of information, and secondly, the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph theorem shows that the wave-function must be an objective property of an individual quantum system. Besides being of foundational interest, results of this sort now find surprising practical applications in areas such as quantum information science and the simulation of quantum systems."

In contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum non-locality in these systems. On the one hand, standard, ""theorist- and experimentalist-friendly"" many-body observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. On the other hand, most of the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve correlations among many particles. Such correlations are notoriously hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally. Typically, there is no Bell inequality for many-body systems built only from low-order correlation functions. Recently, however, it has been shown in [J. Tura et al., Science 344, 1256 (2014)] that multipartite Bell inequalities constructed only from two-body correlation functions are strong enough to reveal non-locality in some many-body states, in particular those relevant for nuclear and atomic physics. The purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the problem of quantum correlations in many-body systems - from entanglement to nonlocality - and the methods for their characterization."

Here I show that the spatial dimension can be switched using gauge fixing. Combining 2D and 3D gauge color codes in a 3D qubit lattice, fault-tolerant quantum computation can be achieved with constant time overhead on the number of logical gates, up to efficient global classical computation, using only local quantum operations. Single-shot error correction plays a crucial role."

While full quantum-security proofs have been given, it remains a major open problem to identify the broadest class of Bell inequalities and lowest performance requirements to achieve such security. In this paper, working within the broad class of spot-checking protocols, we prove exactly which Bell inequality violations can be used to achieve full security. Our result greatly improves the known noise tolerance for secure randomness expansion: for the commonly used CHSH game, full security was only known with a noise tolerance of 1.5%, and we improve this to 10.3%. We also generalize our results beyond Bell inequalities and give the first security proof for randomness expansion based on Kochen-Specker inequalities. The central technical contribution of the paper is a new uncertainty principle for the Schatten norm, which is based on the uniform convexity inequality of Ball, Carlen, and Lieb (Inventiones mathematicae, 115:463-482, 1994)."

Tunneling has been hypothesized as an advantageous physical resource for optimization. Here we present the first experimental evidence of a computational role of multiqubit quantum tunneling in the evolution of a programmable quantum annealer. We develop a theoretical model based on a NIBA Quantum Master Equation to describe the multiqubit dissipative tunneling effects under the complex noise characteristics of such quantum devices. We start by considering a computational primitive, an optimization problem consisting of just one global and one false minimum. The quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global minimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum. In our study the non-convex potentials are realized by frustrated networks of qubit clusters with strong intra-cluster coupling. We show that the collective effect of the quantum environment is suppressed in the ""critical"" phase during the evolution where quantum tunneling ""decides"" the right path to solution. In a later stage dissipation facilitates the multiqubit tunneling leading to the solution state. The predictions of the model accurately describe the experimental data from the D-Wave Two quantum annealer at NASA Ames. In our computational primitive the temperature dependence of the probability of success in the quantum model is opposite to that of the classical paths with thermal hopping. Specifically, we provide an analysis of an optimization problem with sixteen qubits, demonstrating eight qubit tunneling that increases success probabilities. Furthermore, we report results for larger problems with up to 200 qubits that contain the primitive as subproblems."
782,1411.3754,2014,11,17,18,Second laws under control restrictions,Henrik Wilming;Rodrigo Gallego;Jens Eisert,"The second law of thermodynamics, formulated as an ultimate bound on the maximum extractable work, has been rigorously derived in multiple scenarios. However, the unavoidable limitations that emerge due to the lack of control on small systems are often disregarded when deriving such bounds, which is specifically important in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Here, we study the maximum extractable work with limited control over the working system and its interaction with the heat bath. We derive a general second law when the set of accessible Hamiltonians of the working-system is arbitrarily restricted. We then apply our bound to particular scenarios that are important in realistic implementations: limitations on the maximum energy gap and local control over many-body systems. We hence demonstrate in what precise way the lack of control affects the second law. In particular, contrary to the unrestricted case, we show that the optimal work extraction is not achieved by simple thermal contacts. Our results do not only generalize the second law to scenarios of practical relevance, but also take first steps in the direction of local thermodynamics."

Prior work has bounded errors due to Trotterization in terms of the norm of the error operator and analyzed scaling with respect to the number of spin-orbitals. However, we find that these error bounds can be loose by up to sixteen orders of magnitude for some molecules. Furthermore, numerical results for small systems fail to reveal any clear correlation between ground state error and number of spin-orbitals. We instead argue that chemical properties, such as the maximum nuclear charge in a molecule and the filling fraction of orbitals, can be decisive for determining the cost of a quantum simulation. Our analysis motivates several strategies to use classical processing to further reduce the required Trotter step size and to estimate the necessary number of steps, without requiring additional quantum resources. Finally, we demonstrate improved methods for state preparation techniques which are asymptotically superior to proposals in the simulation literature."

A central problem for both classical and quantum randomness generation is to estimate the entropy of the data generated by a given device. Here we present a protocol for self-testing quantum random number generation, in which the user can monitor the entropy in real-time. Based on a few general assumptions, our protocol guarantees continuous generation of high quality randomness, without the need for a detailed characterization of the devices. Using a fully optical setup, we implement our protocol and illustrate its self-testing capacity. Our work thus provides a practical approach to quantum randomness generation in a scenario of trusted but error-prone devices."

We first characterize the set of quantum channels having polytopic images and show that additivity of the minimal output entropy can be violated in this class. We then provide a complete characterization of quantum channels $T$ that are universally image additive in the sense that for any quantum channel $S$, the image of $T \otimes S$ is the convex hull of the tensor product of the images of $T$ and $S$. These channels turn out to form a strict subset of entanglement breaking channels with polytopic images and a strict superset of classical-quantum channels."

We first study several basic properties of PSD-rank, and then develop new techniques for showing lower bounds on the PSD-rank. All of these bounds are based on viewing a positive semidefinite factorization of a matrix $M$ as a quantum communication protocol. These lower bounds depend on the entries of the matrix and not only on its support (the zero/nonzero pattern), overcoming a limitation of some previous techniques. We compare these new lower bounds with known bounds, and give examples where the new ones are better. As an application we determine the PSD-rank of (approximations of) some common matrices."

We introduce the solid code, a 3-d version of Kitaev's surface code, and then combine several solid codes using a technique called welding. The resulting code is a $[[O(L^3),1,O(L^{\frac{4}{3}})]]$ stabilizer code with an energy barrier of $O(L^{\frac{2}{3}})$, which is an exponential improvement over the previous highest energy barrier in 3-d.

At the basis of the analysis is the concept of continuous matrix product states, a complete set of variational states grasping states in quantum field theory. We innovate a practical method, making use of and developing tools in estimation theory used in the context of compressed sensing such as Prony methods and matrix pencils, allowing us to faithfully reconstruct quantum field states based on low-order correlation functions. In the absence of a phase reference, we highlight how specific higher order correlation functions can still be predicted. We exemplify the functioning of the approach by reconstructing randomised continuous matrix product states from their correlation data and study the robustness of the reconstruction for different noise models. We also apply the method to data generated by simulations based on continuous matrix product states and using the time-dependent variational principle. The presented approach is expected to open up a new window into experimentally studying continuous quantum systems, such as encountered in experiments with ultra-cold atoms on top of atom chips. By virtue of the analogy with the input-output formalism in quantum optics, it also allows for studying open quantum systems."
790,1405.5853,2014,6,17,18,Is absolute separability determined by the partial transpose?,Srinivasan Arunachalam;Nathaniel Johnston;Vincent Russo,"The absolute separability problem asks for a characterization of the quantum states $\rho \in M_m\otimes M_n$ with the property that $U\rho U^\dagger$ is separable for all unitary matrices $U$. We investigate whether or not it is the case that $\rho$ is absolutely separable if and only if $U\rho U^\dagger$ has positive partial transpose for all unitary matrices $U$. In particular, we develop an easy-to-use method for showing that an entanglement witness or positive map is unable to detect entanglement in any such state, and we apply our method to many well-known separability criteria, including the range criterion, the realignment criterion, the Choi map and its generalizations, and the Breuer-Hall map. We also show that these two properties coincide for the family of isotropic states, and several eigenvalue results for entanglement witnesses are proved along the way that are of independent interest."
791,1405.5254,2014,5,23,18,Quantum source-channel coding and non-commutative graph theory,Dan Stahlke,"Alice and Bob receive a bipartite state (possibly entangled) from some finite collection or from some subspace. Alice sends a message to Bob through a noisy quantum channel such that Bob may determine the initial state, with zero chance of error. This framework encompasses, for example, teleportation, dense coding, entanglement assisted quantum channel capacity, and one-way communication complexity of function evaluation. With classical sources and channels, this problem can be analyzed using graph homomorphisms. We show this quantum version can be analyzed using homomorphisms on non-commutative graphs (an operator space generalization of graphs). Previously the Lovász $\vartheta$ number has been generalized to non-commutative graphs; we show this to be a homomorphism monotone, thus providing bounds on quantum source-channel coding. We generalize the Schrijver and Szegedy numbers, and show these to be monotones as well. As an application we construct a quantum channel whose entanglement assisted zero-error one-shot capacity can only be unlocked by using a non-maximally entangled state. These homomorphisms allow definition of a chromatic number for non-commutative graphs. Many open questions are presented regarding the possibility of a more fully developed theory."

793,1404.1977,2014,4,25,18,A note on the runtime of a faulty Hamiltonian oracle,Kristan Temme,"In these notes we show that it is impossible to obtain a quantum speedup for a faulty Hamiltonian oracle. The effect of dephasing noise to this continuous time oracle model has first been investigated in [1]. The authors consider a faulty oracle described by a continuous time master equation that acts as dephasing noise in the basis determined by the marked item. The analysis focuses on the implementation with a particular driving Hamiltonian. A universal lower bound for this oracle model, which rules out a better performance with a different driving Hamiltonian has so far been lacking. In this note, we derive an adversary type lower bound which shows that the evolution time T has to be at least in the order of N, i.e. the size of the search space, when the error rate of the oracle is constant. For the standard quantum oracle model this result was first proven in [2]. This note can be seen as an extension of their result to the continuous time setting."
794,1404.1306,2014,4,9,18,Classifying 50 years of Bell inequalities,Denis Rosset;Jean-Daniel Bancal;Nicolas Gisin,"Since John S. Bell demonstrated the interest of studying linear combinations of probabilities in relation with the EPR paradox in 1964, Bell inequalities have lead to numerous developments. Unfortunately, the description of Bell inequalities is subject to several degeneracies, which make any exchange of information about them unnecessarily hard. Here, we analyze these degeneracies and propose a decomposition for Bell-like inequalities based on a set of reference expressions which is not affected by them. These reference expressions set a common ground for comparing Bell inequalities. We provide algorithms based on finite group theory to compute this decomposition. Implementing these algorithms allows us to set up a compendium of reference Bell-like inequalities, available online at http://www.faacets.com . This website constitutes a platform where registered Bell-like inequalities can be explored, new inequalities can be compared to previously-known ones and relevant information on Bell inequalities can be added in a collaborative manner."
795,1404.0457,2014,4,7,18,Violation of the Arrhenius law below the transition temperature,Beni Yoshida,"When interacting spin systems possess non-zero magnetization or topological entanglement entropy below the transition temperature, they often serve as classical or quantum self-correcting memory. In particular, their memory time grows exponentially in the system size due to polynomially growing energy barrier, as in the 2D Ising model and 4D Toric code. Here, we argue that this is not always the case. We demonstrate that memory time of classical clock model (a generalization of ferromagnet to q-state spins) may be polynomially long even when the system possesses finite magnetization. This weak violation of the Arrhenius law occurs above the percolation temperature, but below the transition temperature, a regime where excitation droplets percolate the entire lattice, yet the system retains a finite magnetization. We present numerical evidences for polynomial scaling as well as analytical argument showing that energy barrier is effectively suppressed and is only logarithmically divergent. We also suggest an intriguing possibility of experimentally observing the precession of magnetization vectors at experimentally relevant time scale."
796,1403.5280,2014,4,3,18,Reducing the quantum computing overhead with complex gate distillation,Guillaume Duclos-Cianci;David Poulin,"In leading fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes, accurate transformation are obtained by a two-stage process. In a first stage, a discrete, universal set of fault-tolerant operations is obtained by error-correcting noisy transformations and distilling resource states. In a second stage, arbitrary transformations are synthesized to desired accuracy by combining elements of this set into a circuit. Here, we present a scheme which merges these two stages into a single one, directly distilling complex transformations. We find that our scheme can reduce the total overhead to realize certain gates by up to a few orders of magnitude. In contrast to other schemes, this efficient gate synthesis does not require computationally intensive compilation algorithms, and a straightforward generalization of our scheme circumvents compilation and synthesis altogether."
797,1403.2975,2014,3,24,18,Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+T approximation of z-rotations,Neil J Ross;Peter Selinger,"We consider the problem of approximating arbitrary single-qubit z-rotations by ancilla-free Clifford+T circuits, up to given epsilon. We present a fast new probabilistic algorithm for solving this problem optimally, i.e., for finding the shortest possible circuit whatsoever for the given problem instance. The algorithm requires a factoring oracle (such as a quantum computer). Even in the absence of a factoring oracle, the algorithm is still near-optimal under a mild number-theoretic hypothesis. In this case, the algorithm finds a solution of T-count m + O(log(log(1/epsilon))), where m is the T-count of the second-to-optimal solution. In the typical case, this yields circuit approximations of T-count 3log_2(1/epsilon) + O(log(log(1/epsilon))). Our algorithm is efficient in practice, and provably efficient under the above-mentioned number-theoretic hypothesis, in the sense that its expected runtime is O(polylog(1/epsilon))."

In particular, we show that the same features occur in a simple model of a coin subject to a form of classical backaction with pre- and post-selection. This provides evidence that weak values are not inherently quantum, but rather a purely statistical feature of pre- and post-selection with disturbance."
799,1401.2142,2014,3,11,18,Quantum Algorithms for Nearest-Neighbor Methods for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning,Nathan Wiebe;Ashish Kapoor;Krysta M Svore,"We present several quantum algorithms for performing nearest-neighbor learning. At the core of our algorithms are fast and coherent quantum methods for computing distance metrics such as the inner product and Euclidean distance. We prove upper bounds on the number of queries to the input data required to compute these metrics. In the worst case, our quantum algorithms lead to polynomial reductions in query complexity relative to the corresponding classical algorithm. In certain cases, we show exponential or even super-exponential reductions over the classical analog. We study the performance of our quantum nearest-neighbor algorithms on several real-world binary classification tasks and find that the classification accuracy is competitive with classical methods."
800,1312.2251,2013,1,10,18,A solution of the Gaussian optimizer conjecture,Vittorio Giovannetti;A S Holevo;Raúl García-Patrón,"The long-standing conjectures of the optimality of Gaussian inputs for Gaussian channel and Gaussian additivity are solved for a broad class of covariant or contravariant Bosonic Gaussian channels (which includes in particular thermal, additive classical noise, and amplifier channels) restricting to the class of states with finite second moments. We show that the vacuum is the input state which minimizes the entropy at the output of such channels. This allows us to show also that the classical capacity of these channels (under the input energy constraint) is additive and is achieved by Gaussian encodings."

Using this framework, we exhibit various families inequivalent to that proposed by van Dam and Hayden. We suggest a possible improvement and present detail numerical analysis."
802,1311.4895,2013,11,28,18,Efficient Decoders for Qudit Topological Codes,Hussain Anwar;Benjamin J Brown;Earl T Campbell;Daniel E Browne,"Qudit toric codes are a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the well-studied qubit toric code. However standard methods for error correction of the qubit toric code are not applicable to them. Novel decoders are needed. In this paper we introduce two renormalization group decoders for qudit codes and analyze their error correction thresholds and efficiency. The first decoder is a generalization of a ""hard-decisions"" decoder due to Bravyi and Haah [arXiv:1112.3252]. We modify this decoder to overcome a percolation effect which limits its threshold performance for high dimensions. The second decoder is a generalization of a ""soft-decisions"" decoder due to Poulin and Duclos-Cianci [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 050504 (2010)], with a small cell size to optimize the efficiency of implementation in the high dimensional case. In each case, we estimate thresholds for the uncorrelated bit-flip error model and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of both these approaches to error correction of qudit toric codes."
803,1311.3046,2013,11,21,18,Jordan-Wigner formalism for arbitrary 2-input 2-output matchgates and their classical simulation,Richard Jozsa;Akimasa Miyake;Sergii Strelchuk,"In Valiant's matchgate theory, 2-input 2-output matchgates are 4x4 matrices that satisfy ten so-called matchgate identities. We prove that the set of all such matchgates (including non-unitary and non-invertible ones) coincides with the topological closure of the set of all matrices obtained as exponentials of linear combinations of the 2-qubit Jordan-Wigner (JW) operators and their quadratic products, extending a previous result of Knill. In Valiant's theory, outputs of matchgate circuits can be classically computed in poly-time. Via the JW formalism, Terhal & DiVincenzo and Knill established a relation of a unitary class of these circuits to the efficient simulation of non-interacting fermions. We describe how the JW formalism may be used to give an efficient simulation for all cases in Valiant's simulation theorem, which in particular includes the case of non-interacting fermions generalised to allow arbitrary 1-qubit gates on the first line at any stage in the circuit. Finally we give an exposition of how these simulation results can be alternatively understood from some basic Lie algebra theory, in terms of a formalism introduced by Somma et al."
804,1308.6702,2013,11,14,18,Adversarial hypothesis testing and a quantum Stein's Lemma for restricted measurements,Fernando G S L Brandão;Aram W Harrow;James R Lee;Yuval Peres,"Recall the classical hypothesis testing setting with two convex sets of probability distributions P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a distribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q and wants to decide from which set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential rate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood ratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q. We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in P and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on the previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having observed all the previous samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k in Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in this case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q. We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis testing for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can be used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of all separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The basic idea is that in our setup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated by an adaptive classical adversary. We prove a quantum Stein's Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances, the optimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum relative entropy between two states. In particular, our arguments yield an alternate proof of Li and Winter's recent strengthening of strong subadditivity for quantum relative entropy."

Perhaps surprisingly, a single source of randomness cannot be amplified at all classically. However, the situation is different if one considers correlations allowed by quantum mechanics as an extra resource. Here we present a protocol that amplifies Santha-Vazirani sources arbitrarily close to deterministic into fully random sources. The protocol is device independent, depending only on the observed statistics of the devices and on the validity of the no-signaling principle between different devices. It improves previously-known protocols in two respects. First the protocol is tolerant to noise so that even noisy quantum-mechanical systems give rise to good devices for the protocol. Second it is simpler, being based on the violation of a four-party Bell inequality and on the XOR as a hash function. As a technical tool we prove a new de Finetti theorem where the subsystems are selected from a Santha-Vazirani source."

In this Letter, we show that for translation invariant systems, simultaneous eigenstates of energy and momentum with an eigenvalue that is separated from the rest of the spectrum in that momentum sector, can be arbitrarily well approximated by building a momentum superposition of a local operator acting on the ground state. The error decreases in the size of the support of the local operator, with a rate that is set by the gap below and above the targeted eigenvalue. We show this explicitly for the AKLT model and discuss generalizations and applications of our result."
807,1304.2879,2013,5,10,18,Ising models and topological codes: classical algorithms and quantum simulation,Maarten Van den Nest;Wolfgang Dür,"We present an algorithm to approximate partition functions of 3-body classical Ising models on two-dimensional lattices of arbitrary genus, in the real-temperature regime. Even though our algorithm is purely classical, it is designed by exploiting a connection to topological quantum systems, namely the color codes. The algorithm performance is exponentially better than other approaches which employ mappings between partition functions and quantum state overlaps. In addition, our approach gives rise to a protocol for quantum simulation of such Ising models by simply measuring local observables on color codes."
808,1304.1555,2013,4,11,18,A Return to the Optimal Detection of Quantum Information,Eric Chitambar;Min-Hsiu Hsieh,"In 1991, Asher Peres and William Wootters wrote a seminal paper on the nonlocal processing of quantum information [\textitPhys. Rev. Lett. \textbf66 1119 (1991)]. We return to their classic problem and solve it in various contexts. Specifically, for discriminating the ""double trine"" ensemble with minimum error, we prove that global operations are more powerful than local operations with classical communication (LOCC). Even stronger, there exists a finite gap between the optimal LOCC probability and that obtainable by separable operations (SEP). Additionally we prove that a two-way, adaptive LOCC strategy can always beat a one-way protocol. Our results provide the first known instance of ""nonlocality without entanglement"" in two qubit pure states."
809,1212.0025,2012,4,5,18,Generalizing and Derandomizing Gurvits's Approximation Algorithm for the Permanent,Scott Aaronson;Travis Hance,"Around 2002, Leonid Gurvits gave a striking randomized algorithm to approximate the permanent of an n*n matrix A. The algorithm runs in O(n^2/eps^2) time, and approximates Per(A) to within eps*||A||^n additive error. A major advantage of Gurvits's algorithm is that it works for arbitrary matrices, not just for nonnegative matrices. This makes it highly relevant to quantum optics, where the permanents of bounded-norm complex matrices play a central role. Indeed, the existence of Gurvits's algorithm is why, in their recent work on the hardness of quantum optics, Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) had to talk about sampling problems rather than estimation problems. In this paper, we improve Gurvits's algorithm in two ways. First, using an idea from quantum optics, we generalize the algorithm so that it yields a better approximation when the matrix A has either repeated rows or repeated columns. Translating back to quantum optics, this lets us classically estimate the probability of any outcome of an AA-type experiment---even an outcome involving multiple photons ""bunched"" in the same mode---at least as well as that probability can be estimated by the experiment itself. (This does not, of course, let us solve the AA sampling problem.) It also yields a general upper bound on the probabilities of ""bunched"" outcomes, which resolves a conjecture of Gurvits and might be of independent physical interest. Second, we use eps-biased sets to derandomize Gurvits's algorithm, in the special case where the matrix A is nonnegative. More interestingly, we generalize the notion of eps-biased sets to the complex numbers, construct ""complex eps-biased sets,"" then use those sets to derandomize even our generalization of Gurvits's algorithm to the multirow/multicolumn case (again for nonnegative A). Whether Gurvits's algorithm can be derandomized for general A remains an outstanding problem."
810,1211.1037,2012,12,4,18,The Minimal Work Cost of Information Processing,Philippe Faist;Frédéric Dupuis;Jonathan Oppenheim;Renato Renner,"Irreversible information processing cannot be carried out without some inevitable thermodynamical work cost. This fundamental restriction, known as Landauer's principle, is increasingly relevant today, as the energy dissipation of computing devices impedes the development of their performance. Here we determine the minimal work required to carry out any logical process, for instance a computation. It is given by the entropy of the discarded information conditional to the output of the computation. Our formula takes precisely into account the statistically fluctuating work requirement of the logical process. It enables the explicit calculation of practical scenarios, such as computational circuits or quantum measurements. On the conceptual level, our result gives a precise and operationally justified connection between thermodynamic and information entropy, and explains the emergence of the entropy state function in macroscopic thermodynamics."

While LOCC emerges as the natural class of operations in many important quantum information tasks, its mathematical structure is complex and difficult to characterize. Here we provide a precise description of LOCC and related operational classes in terms of quantum instruments. Our formalism captures both finite round protocols as well as those that utilize an unbounded number of communication rounds. While the set of LOCC is not topologically closed, we show that finite round LOCC constitutes a compact subset of quantum operations. Additionally we show the existence of an open ball around the completely depolarizing map that consists entirely of LOCC implementable maps. Finally, we demonstrate a two-qubit map whose action can be approached arbitrarily close using LOCC, but nevertheless cannot be implemented perfectly."
812,1210.1148,2012,10,18,18,Quantum algorithms for search with wildcards and combinatorial group testing,Andris Ambainis;Ashley Montanaro,"We consider two combinatorial problems. The first we call ""search with wildcards"": given an unknown n-bit string x, and the ability to check whether any subset of the bits of x is equal to a provided query string, the goal is to output x. We give a nearly optimal O(sqrt(n) log n) quantum query algorithm for search with wildcards, beating the classical lower bound of Omega(n) queries. Rather than using amplitude amplification or a quantum walk, our algorithm is ultimately based on the solution to a state discrimination problem. The second problem we consider is combinatorial group testing, which is the task of identifying a subset of at most k special items out of a set of n items, given the ability to make queries of the form ""does the set S contain any special items?"" for any subset S of the n items. We give a simple quantum algorithm which uses O(k log k) queries to solve this problem, as compared with the classical lower bound of Omega(k log(n/k)) queries."
813,1209.4781,2012,10,4,18,Almost all decision trees do not allow significant quantum speed-up,Ashley Montanaro,"We show that, for any d, all but a doubly exponentially small fraction of decision trees of depth at most d require Omega(d) quantum queries to be computed with bounded error. In other words, most efficient classical algorithms in the query complexity model do not admit a significant quantum speed-up. The proof is based on showing that, with high probability, the average sensitivity of a random decision tree is high."
814,1208.0692,2012,9,24,18,Local random quantum circuits are approximate polynomial-designs,Fernando G S L Brandão;Aram W Harrow;Michał Horodecki,"We prove that local random quantum circuits acting on n qubits composed of O(t^10 n^2) many nearest neighbor two-qubit gates form an approximate unitary t-design. Previously it was unknown whether random quantum circuits were a t-design for any t > 3. The proof is based on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body theory, representation theory, and the theory of Markov chains. In particular we employ a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the spectral gap of frustration-free quantum local Hamiltonians; a quasi-orthogonality property of permutation matrices; a result of Oliveira which extends to the unitary group the path-coupling method for bounding the mixing time of random walks; and a result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing that dense subgroups of the special unitary group, composed of elements with algebraic entries, are infty-copy tensor-product expanders. We also consider pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum circuits of small depth and prove that circuits of depth O(t^10n) constitute a quantum t-copy tensor-product expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum many-body theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov, Arad, Landau, and Vazirani. We give applications of the results to cryptography, equilibration of closed quantum dynamics, and the generation of topological order. In particular we show the following pseudo-randomness property of generic quantum circuits: Almost every circuit U of size O(n^k) on n qubits cannot be distinguished from a Haar uniform unitary by circuits of size O(n^(k-9)/11) that are given oracle access to U."
815,1604.08176,2016,8,6,17,Analytic and nearly optimal self-testing bounds for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Mermin inequalities,Jędrzej Kaniewski,"Self-testing refers to the phenomenon that certain extremal quantum correlations (almost) uniquely identify the quantum system under consideration. For instance observing the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality certifies that the two parties share a singlet. While self-testing results are known for several classes of states, in many cases they are only applicable if the observed statistics are almost perfect, which makes them unsuitable for practical applications. Practically relevant self-testing bounds are much less common and moreover they all result from a single numerical method (with one exception which we discuss in detail). In this work we present a new technique for proving analytic self-testing bounds of practically relevant robustness. We obtain improved bounds for the case of self-testing the singlet using the CHSH inequality (in particular we show that non-trivial fidelity with the singlet can be achieved as long as the violation exceeds $\beta^{*} = (16 + 14 \sqrt{2})/17 \approx 2.11$). In case of self-testing the tripartite GHZ state using the Mermin inequality we derive a bound which not only improves on previously known results but turns out to be tight. We discuss other scenarios to which our technique can be immediately applied."

The technique is based on a class of graphs used by Cabello, Severini and Winter in 2010. The upper bound uses the famous Lovász theta number and is efficiently computable; the lower one is based on the quantum independence number, which is a quantity used in the study of entanglement-assisted channel capacities and graph homomorphism games."

Typically approximate inference techniques are used instead to sample from the distribution on query variables given the values $e$ of evidence variables. Classically, a single unbiased sample is obtained from a Bayesian network on $n$ variables with at most $m$ parents per node in time $\mathcal{O}(nmP(e)^{-1})$, depending critically on $P(e)$, the probability the evidence might occur in the first place. By implementing a quantum version of rejection sampling, we obtain a square-root speedup, taking $\mathcal{O}(n2^mP(e)^{-\frac12})$ time per sample. We exploit the Bayesian network's graph structure to efficiently construct a quantum state, a q-sample, representing the intended classical distribution, and also to efficiently apply amplitude amplification, the source of our speedup. Thus, our speedup is notable as it is unrelativized -- we count primitive operations and require no blackbox oracle queries."

Several questions are posed, such as: are all such sets ""nested"", i.e., contained into one another? Are they discrete or do they form a continuum? How many of them are supraquantum? Are there non-trivial polytopes among them? We answer some of these questions or relate them with established conjectures in complexity theory by introducing a ""zoo"" of physically consistent sets which can be characterized efficiently via either linear or semidefinite programming. As a bonus, we use the zoo to derive, for the first time, concrete impossibility results in nonlocality distillation."

From the mathematical point of view they provide highly nontrivial generalization of positive operators and they find elegant correspondence with the theory of positive maps in matrix algebras. We concentrate on theoretical analysis of various important notions like (in)decomposability, atomicity, optimality, extremality and exposedness. Several methods of construction are provided as well. Our discussion is illustrated by many examples enabling the reader to see the intricate structure of these objects. It is shown that the theory of entanglement witnesses finds elegant geometric formulation in terms of convex cones and related geometric structures."

We consider a nonlocal game in which Alice and Bob are trying to convince a verifier with certainty that a graph $X$ admits a homomorphism to $Y$. This is a generalization of the well-studied graph coloring game. Via systematic study of quantum homomorphisms we prove new results for graph coloring. Most importantly, we show that the Lovász theta number of the complement lower bounds the quantum chromatic number, which itself is not known to be computable. We also show that some of our newly introduced graph parameters, namely quantum independence and clique numbers, can differ from their classical counterparts while others, namely quantum odd girth, cannot. Finally, we show that quantum homomorphisms closely relate to zero-error channel capacity. In particular, we use quantum homomorphisms to construct graphs for which entanglement-assistance increases their one-shot zero-error capacity."

By introducing a fractional symmetry of SPTO, which requires the invariance under 3-colorable symmetries of a lattice, we prove that every renormalization fixed-point state of 2D $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^m$ SPTO with fractional symmetry can be utilized for universal quantum computation using only Pauli measurements, as long as it belongs to a nontrivial 2D SPTO phase. Our infinite family of fixed-point states may serve as a base model to demonstrate the idea of a ""quantum computational phase"" of matter, whose states share universal computational complexity ubiquitously."

The time evolution is performed by an operator splitting decomposition technique that allows for a mapping of the Dirac operator to a quantum walk supplemented by unitary rotation steps in spinor space. Every step of the splitting method is decomposed into sets of quantum gates. It is demonstrated that the algorithm has an exponential speedup over the implementation of the same numerical scheme on a classical computer, as long as certain conditions are satisfied. Finally, an explicit decomposition of this algorithm into elementary gates from a universal set is carried out to determine the resource requirements. It is shown that a proof-of-principle calculation may be possible with actual quantum technologies."
824,1611.04439,2016,11,16,17,The topological classification of one-dimensional symmetric quantum walks,C Cedzich;T Geib;F A Grünbaum;C Stahl;L Velázquez;A H Werner;Reinhard F Werner,"We give a topological classification of quantum walks on an infinite 1D lattice, which obey one of the discrete symmetry groups of the tenfold way, have a gap around some eigenvalues at symmetry protected points, and satisfy a mild locality condition. No translation invariance is assumed. The classification is parameterized by three indices, taking values in a group, which is either trivial, the group of integers, or the group of integers modulo 2, depending on the type of symmetry. The classification is complete in the sense that two walks have the same indices if and only if they can be connected by a norm continuous path along which all the mentioned properties remain valid. Of the three indices, two are related to the asymptotic behaviour far to the right and far to the left, respectively. These are also stable under compact perturbations. The third index is sensitive to those compact perturbations which cannot be contracted to a trivial one. The results apply to the Hamiltonian case as well. In this case all compact perturbations can be contracted, so the third index is not defined. Our classification extends the one known in the translation invariant case, where the asymptotic right and left indices add up to zero, and the third one vanishes, leaving effectively only one independent index. When two translationally invariant bulks with distinct indices are joined, the left and right asymptotic indices of the joined walk are thereby fixed, and there must be eigenvalues at $1$ or $-1$ (bulk-boundary correspondence). Their location is governed by the third index. We also discuss how the theory applies to finite lattices, with suitable homogeneity assumptions."
825,1609.08487,2016,11,15,17,Fully general device-independence for two-party cryptography and position verification,Jérémy Ribeiro;Gláucia Murta;Stephanie Wehner,"Device-independent quantum cryptography allows security even if the devices used to execute the protocol are untrusted - whether this is due to unknown imperfections in the implementation, or because the adversary himself constructed them to subvert the security of the protocol. While device-independence has seen much attention in the domain of quantum key distribution, relatively little is known for general protocols. Here we introduce a new model for device-independence for two-party protocols and position verification in the noisy-storage model. For the first time, we show that such protocols are secure in the most general device-independent model in which the devices may have arbitrary memory, states and measurements. In our analysis, we make use of a slight modification of a beautiful new tool developed in [arXiv:1607.01796] called ""Entropy Accumulation Theorem"". What's more, the protocols we analyze use only simple preparations and measurements, and can be realized using any experimental setup able to perform a CHSH Bell test. Specifically, security can be attained for any violation of the CHSH inequality, where a higher violation merely leads to a reduction in the amount of rounds required to execute the protocol."
826,1609.07476,2016,10,18,17,Asymptotic tensor rank of graph tensors: beyond matrix multiplication,Matthias Christandl;Péter Vrana;Jeroen Zuiddam,"We present an upper bound on the exponent of the asymptotic behaviour of the tensor rank of a family of tensors defined by the complete graph on $k$ vertices. For $k\geq4$, we show that the exponent per edge is at most 0.77, outperforming the best known upper bound on the exponent per edge for matrix multiplication ($k=3$), which is approximately 0.79. We raise the question whether for some $k$ the exponent per edge can be below $2/3$, i.e. can outperform matrix multiplication even if the matrix multiplication exponent equals 2. In order to obtain our results, we generalise to higher order tensors a result by Strassen on the asymptotic subrank of tight tensors and a result by Coppersmith and Winograd on the asymptotic rank of matrix multiplication. Our results have applications in entanglement theory and communication complexity."
827,1609.01997,2016,9,28,17,Energy-constrained private and quantum capacities of quantum channels,Mark M Wilde;Haoyu Qi,"This paper establishes a general theory of energy-constrained quantum and private capacities of quantum channels. We begin by defining various energy-constrained communication tasks, including quantum communication with a uniform energy constraint, entanglement transmission with an average energy constraint, private communication with a uniform energy constraint, and secret key transmission with an average energy constraint. We develop several code conversions, which allow us to conclude non-trivial relations between the capacities corresponding to the above tasks. We then show how the regularized, energy-constrained coherent information is an achievable rate for all of the tasks, whenever the energy observable satisfies the Gibbs condition of having a well defined thermal state for all temperatures and the channel satisfies a finite output-entropy condition. For degradable channels satisfying these conditions, we find that the single-letter energy-constrained coherent information is equal to all of the capacities. We finally apply our results to degradable quantum Gaussian channels and recover several results already established in the literature (in some cases, we prove new results in this domain). Contrary to what may appear from some statements made in the literature recently, proofs of these results do not require the solution of any kind of minimum output-entropy conjecture or entropy photon-number inequality."
828,1608.06950,2016,9,26,17,Quantum Entanglement Growth Under Random Unitary Dynamics,Adam Nahum;Jonathan Ruhman;Sagar Vijay;Jeongwan Haah,"Characterizing how entanglement grows with time in a many-body system, for example after a quantum quench, is a key problem in non-equilibrium quantum physics. We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time--dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the `entanglement tsunami' in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like $(\text{time})^{1/3}$ and are spatially correlated over a distance $\propto (\text{time})^{2/3}$. We derive KPZ universal behaviour in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to: (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface; (ii) a `minimal cut' picture, reminiscent of the Ryu--Takayanagi formula in holography; and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple `minimal cut' picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the `velocity' of entanglement growth in the 1D `entanglement tsunami'. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a membrane or domain wall by disorder."
829,1608.06617,2016,9,8,17,Quantum Communication Complexity of Distributed Set Joins,Stacey Jeffery;François Le Gall,"Computing set joins of two inputs is a common task in database theory. Recently, Van Gucht, Williams, Woodruff and Zhang [PODS 2015] considered the complexity of such problems in the natural model of (classical) two-party communication complexity and obtained tight bounds for the complexity of several important distributed set joins. In this paper we initiate the study of the *quantum* communication complexity of distributed set joins. We design a quantum protocol for distributed Boolean matrix multiplication, which corresponds to computing the composition join of two databases, showing that the product of two $n\times n$ Boolean matrices, each owned by one of two respective parties, can be computed with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\ell^{3/4})$ qubits of communication, where $\ell$ denotes the number of non-zero entries of the product. Since Van Gucht et al. showed that the classical communication complexity of this problem is $\widetilde{\Theta}(n\sqrt{\ell})$, our quantum algorithm outperforms classical protocols whenever the output matrix is sparse. We also show a quantum lower bound and a matching classical upper bound on the communication complexity of distributed matrix multiplication over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Besides their applications to database theory, the communication complexity of set joins is interesting due to its connections to direct product theorems in communication complexity. In this work we also introduce a notion of *all-pairs* product theorem, and relate this notion to standard direct product theorems in communication complexity."
830,1608.02618,2016,8,26,17,"Jones index, secret sharing and total quantum dimension",Leander Fiedler;Pieter Naaijkens;Tobias J Osborne,"We study the total quantum dimension in the thermodynamic limit of topologically ordered systems. In particular, using the anyons (or superselection sectors) of such models, we define a secret sharing scheme, storing information invisible to a malicious party, and argue that the total quantum dimension quantifies how well we can perform this task. We then argue that this can be made mathematically rigorous using the index theory of subfactors, originally due to Jones and later extended by Kosaki and Longo. This theory provides us with a ""relative entropy"" of two von Neumann algebras and a quantum channel, and we argue how these can be used to quantify how much classical information two parties can hide form an adversary. We also review the total quantum dimension in finite systems, in particular how it relates to topological entanglement entropy. It is known that the latter also has an interpretation in terms of secret sharing schemes, although this is shown by completely different methods from ours. Our work provides a different and independent take on this, which at the same time is completely mathematically rigorous. This complementary point of view might be beneficial, for example, when studying the stability of the total quantum dimension when the system is perturbed."
831,1607.03389,2016,8,24,17,Adiabatic optimization versus diffusion Monte Carlo,Michael Jarret;Stephen P Jordan;Brad Lackey,"Most experimental and theoretical studies of adiabatic optimization use stoquastic Hamiltonians, whose ground states are expressible using only real nonnegative amplitudes. This raises a question as to whether classical Monte Carlo methods can simulate stoquastic adiabatic algorithms with polynomial overhead. Here, we analyze diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. We argue that, based on differences between L1 and L2 normalized states, these algorithms suffer from certain obstructions preventing them from efficiently simulating stoquastic adiabatic evolution in generality. In practice however, we obtain good performance by introducing a method that we call Substochastic Monte Carlo. In fact, our simulations are good classical optimization algorithms in their own right, competitive with the best previously known heuristic solvers for MAX-k-SAT at k=2,3,4."

One domain is two-party cryptography, whose goal is to allow two parties who may not trust each other to solve joint tasks. Another interesting application is position-based cryptography whose goal is to use the geographical location of an entity as its only identifying credential. Unfortunately, security of these protocols is not possible against an all powerful adversary. However, if we impose some realistic physical constraints on the adversary, there exist protocols for which security can be proven, but these so far relied on the knowledge of the quantum operations performed during the protocols. In this work we give device-independent security proofs of two-party cryptography and Position Verification for memoryless devices under different physical constraints on the adversary. We assess the quality of the devices by observing a Bell violation and we show that security can be attained for any violation of the Clauser-Holt-Shimony-Horne inequality."
833,1606.03795,2016,7,13,17,Error suppression for Hamiltonian-based quantum computation using subsystem codes,Milad Marvian;Daniel A Lidar,"We present general conditions for quantum error suppression for Hamiltonian-based quantum computation using subsystem codes. This involves encoding the Hamiltonian performing the computation using an error detecting subsystem code and the addition of a penalty term that commutes with the encoded Hamiltonian. The scheme is general and includes the stabilizer formalism of both subspace and subsystem codes as special cases. We derive performance bounds and show that complete error suppression results in the large penalty limit. To illustrate the power of subsystem-based error suppression, we introduce fully 2-local constructions for protection of the swap gate of adiabatic gate teleportation and the Ising chain in a transverse field."

Simulating fermionic models on general purpose quantum computers requires imposing a fermionic algebra on spins. The previously studied Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transformations are two techniques for accomplishing this task. Here we re-examine an auxiliary fermion construction which maps fermionic operators to local operators on spins. The local simulation is performed by relaxing the requirement that the number of spins should match the number of fermionic modes. Instead, auxiliary modes are introduced to enable non-consecutive fermionic couplings to be simulated with constant low-rank tensor products on spins. We connect the auxiliary fermion construction to other topological models and give examples of the construction."
835,1604.02119,2016,6,14,17,Data processing for the sandwiched Rényi divergence: a condition for equality,Felix Leditzky;Cambyse Rouzé;Nilanjana Datta,"The $\alpha$-sandwiched Rényi divergence satisfies the data processing inequality, i.e. monotonicity under quantum operations, for $\alpha\geq 1/2$. In this article, we derive a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality for the $\alpha$-sandwiched Rényi divergence for all $\alpha\geq 1/2$. For the range $\alpha\in [1/2,1)$, our result provides the only condition for equality obtained thus far. To prove our result, we first consider the special case of partial trace, and derive a condition for equality based on the original proof of the data processing inequality by Frank and Lieb [J. Math. Phys. 54.12 (2013), p. 122201] using a strict convexity/concavity argument. We then generalize to arbitrary quantum operations via the Stinespring Representation Theorem. As applications of our condition for equality in the data processing inequality, we deduce conditions for equality in various entropic inequalities. We formulate a Rényi version of the Araki-Lieb inequality and analyze the case of equality, generalizing a result by Carlen and Lieb [Lett. Math. Phys. 101.1 (2012), pp. 1-11] about equality in the original Araki-Lieb inequality. Furthermore, we prove a general lower bound on a Rényi version of the entanglement of formation, and observe that it is attained by states saturating the Rényi version of the Araki-Lieb inequality. Finally, we prove that the known upper bound on the entanglement fidelity in terms of the usual fidelity is saturated only by pure states."
836,1603.07856,2016,6,1,17,Using Simon's Algorithm to Attack Symmetric-Key Cryptographic Primitives,Thomas Santoli;Christian Schaffner,"We present new connections between quantum information and the field of classical cryptography. In particular, we provide examples where Simon's algorithm can be used to show insecurity of commonly used cryptographic symmetric-key primitives. Specifically, these examples consist of a quantum distinguisher for the 3-round Feistel network and a forgery attack on CBC-MAC which forges a tag for a chosen-prefix message querying only other messages (of the same length). We assume that an adversary has quantum-oracle access to the respective classical primitives. Similar results have been achieved recently in independent work by Kaplan et al. Our findings shed new light on the post-quantum security of cryptographic schemes and underline that classical security proofs of cryptographic constructions need to be revisited in light of quantum attackers."
837,1603.03757,2016,4,8,17,Nondeterministic quantum communication complexity: the cyclic equality game and iterated matrix multiplication,Harry Buhrman;Matthias Christandl;Jeroen Zuiddam,"We study nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with a quantum generalization of broadcasts. We show that, with number-in-hand classical inputs, the communication complexity of a Boolean function in this communication model equals the logarithm of the support rank of the corresponding tensor, whereas the approximation complexity in this model equals the logarithm of the border support rank. This characterisation allows us to prove a log-rank conjecture posed by Villagra et al. for nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with message-passing. The support rank characterization of the communication model connects quantum communication complexity intimately to the theory of asymptotic entanglement transformation and algebraic complexity theory. In this context, we introduce the graphwise equality problem. For a cycle graph, the complexity of this communication problem is closely related to the complexity of the computational problem of multiplying matrices, or more precisely, it equals the logarithm of the asymptotic support rank of the iterated matrix multiplication tensor. We employ Strassen's laser method to show that asymptotically there exist nontrivial protocols for every odd-player cyclic equality problem. We exhibit an efficient protocol for the 5-player problem for small inputs, and we show how Young flattenings yield nontrivial complexity lower bounds."

We apply our method to the Khot-Vishnoi game, with exponentially many questions per player, to produce another game with polynomially many ($N\approx n^8$) questions so that the quantum over the classical bias is $\Omega (n/\log^2 n)$."

We develop two quantum algorithms for perceptron learning. The first algorithm exploits quantum information processing to determine a separating hyperplane using a number of steps sublinear in the number of data points $N$, namely $O(\sqrt{N})$. The second algorithm illustrates how the classical mistake bound of $O(\frac{1}{\gamma^2})$ can be further improved to $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}})$ through quantum means, where $\gamma$ denotes the margin. Such improvements are achieved through the application of quantum amplitude amplification to the version space interpretation of the perceptron model."

For this purpose we prove that if the partial transpose of a two-qutrit NPT state has two non-positive eigenvalues, then the state is distillable. We further construct a parametrized two-qutrit NPT entangled state of rank five which is not 1-distillable, and show that it is not $n$-distillable for any given $n$ when the parameter is sufficiently small. This state has the smallest rank among all 1-undistillable NPT states. We conjecture that the state is not distillable."

Relatively little is known, however, about how to construct a magic state distillation routine or, more specifically, which stabilizer codes are suitable for the task. While transversality of a non-Clifford gate within a code often leads to efficient distillation routines, it appears to not be a necessary condition. Here we have examined a number of small stabilizer codes and highlight a handful of which displaying interesting, albeit inefficient, distillation behaviour. Many of these distill noisy states right up to the boundary of the known undististillable region, while some distill toward non-stabilizer states that have not previously been considered."
843,1512.03824,2015,2,4,17,Improved Quantum Ternary Arithmetics,Alex Bocharov;Shawn X Cui;Martin Roetteler;Krysta M Svore,"Qutrit (or ternary) structures arise naturally in many quantum systems, particularly in certain non-abelian anyon systems. We present efficient circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely ripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set. Our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only $1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than previous constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth of only $O(\log\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on two levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of non-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections further by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\rangle \mapsto |i, j + \delta_{i,2} \mod 3\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate $P_9=\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \pi \, i/9},1,e^{2 \pi \, i/9})$. The two choices of elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and the supermetaplectic basis, respectively. Finally, we develop a method to factor diagonal unitaries using multi-variate polynomial over the ternary finite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be implemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis."

Our approach synthesizes recent advances in materials growth with tools commonly used in quantum-dot experiments, including gate-control of tunnel barriers and Coulomb effects, charge sensing, and charge pumping. We outline a sequence of milestones interpolating between zero-mode detection and quantum computing that includes (1) detection of fusion rules for non-Abelian anyons using either proximal charge sensors or pumped current; (2) validation of a prototype topological qubit; and (3) demonstration of non-Abelian statistics by braiding in a branched geometry. The first two milestones require only a single wire with two islands, and additionally enable sensitive measurements of the system's excitation gap, quasiparticle poisoning rates, residual Majorana zero-mode splittings, and topological-qubit coherence times. These pre-braiding experiments can be adapted to other manipulation and readout schemes as well."

We demonstrate that the distillable entanglement is zero for pure abelian gauge theories in the weak coupling limit, while it is in general nonzero for the nonabelian case. We also consider gauge theories with matter, and show in a perturbative approach how area laws -- including a topological correction -- emerge for the distillable entanglement."

Cryptographers are already anticipating this threat by proposing and studying a number of potentially quantum-safe alternatives for those primitives. On the other hand, symmetric primitives seem less vulnerable against quantum computing: the main known applicable result is Grover's algorithm that gives a quadratic speed-up for exhaustive search. In this work, we examine more closely the security of symmetric ciphers against quantum attacks. Since our trust in symmetric ciphers relies mostly on their ability to resist cryptanalysis techniques, we investigate quantum cryptanalysis techniques. More specifically, we consider quantum versions of differential and linear cryptanalysis. We show that it is usually possible to use quantum computations to obtain a quadratic speed-up for these attack techniques, but the situation must be nuanced: we don't get a quadratic speed-up for all variants of the attacks. This allows us to demonstrate the following non-intuitive result: the best attack in the classical world does not necessarily lead to the best quantum one. We give some examples of application on ciphers LAC and KLEIN. We also discuss the important difference between an adversary that can only perform quantum computations, and an adversary that can also make quantum queries to a keyed primitive."

This family of models is obtained by a deformation of the well-studied 2D quantum antiferromagnetic model of Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT); they are described by two-body, frustration-free Hamiltonians on a three-colourable lattice of spins. Although the existence of a spectral gap in the 2D AKLT model remains an open question, we rigorously prove the existence of a gap for a subset of this family of quantum antiferromagnets. Along with providing new progress for the gap problem in AKLT-type antiferromagnets in 2D, this result has implications for the theory of quantum computation as it provides a family of two-body Hamiltonians for which the ground state is a resource for universal quantum computation and for which a spectral gap is proven to exist."

The optimal exponent of an upper bound on the relative entropy in this case is given by the log-Sobolev-1 constant. Our main result is the computation of this constant. As an application we use the log-Sobolev-1 constant of the depolarizing channels to improve the concavity inequality of the von-Neumann entropy. This result is compared to similar bounds obtained recently by Kim et al. and we show a version of Pinsker's inequality, which is optimal and tight if we fix the second argument of the relative entropy. Finally, we consider the log-Sobolev-1 constant of tensor-powers of the completely depolarizing channel and use a quantum version of Shearer's inequality to prove a uniform lower bound."
849,1508.03107,2015,9,17,17,"Entropy, majorization and thermodynamics in general probabilistic theories",Howard Barnum;Jonathan Barrett;Marius Krumm;Markus P Müller,"In this note we lay some groundwork for the resource theory of thermodynamics in general probabilistic theories (GPTs). We consider theories satisfying a purely convex abstraction of the spectral decomposition of density matrices: that every state has a decomposition, with unique probabilities, into perfectly distinguishable pure states. The spectral entropy, and analogues using other Schur-concave functions, can be defined as the entropy of these probabilities. We describe additional conditions under which the outcome probabilities of a fine-grained measurement are majorized by those for a spectral measurement, and therefore the ""spectral entropy"" is the measurement entropy (and therefore concave). These conditions are (1) projectivity, which abstracts aspects of the Lueders-von Neumann projection postulate in quantum theory, in particular that every face of the state space is the positive part of the image of a certain kind of projection operator called a filter; and (2) symmetry of transition probabilities. The conjunction of these, as shown earlier by Araki, is equivalent to a strong geometric property of the unnormalized state cone known as perfection: that there is an inner product according to which every face of the cone, including the cone itself, is self-dual. Using some assumptions about the thermodynamic cost of certain processes that are partially motivated by our postulates, especially projectivity, we extend von Neumann's argument that the thermodynamic entropy of a quantum system is its spectral entropy to generalized probabilistic systems satisfying spectrality."
850,1507.00299,2015,8,31,17,Quantum Marginal Problem and its Physical Relevance,Christian Schilling,"The Pauli exclusion principle as constraint on fermionic occupation numbers is a consequence of the much deeper fermionic exchange statistics. Just recently, it was shown by Klyachko that this antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions leads to further restrictions on natural occupation numbers. These so-called generalized Pauli constraints (GPC) significantly strengthen Pauli's exclusion principle. Our first goal is to develop an understanding of the mathematical concepts behind Klyachko's work, in the context of quantum marginal problems. Afterwards, we explore the physical relevance of GPC and study concrete physical systems from that new viewpoint. In the first part of this thesis we review Klyachko's solution of the univariate quantum marginal problem. In particular we break his abstract derivation based on algebraic topology down to a more elementary level and reveal the geometrical picture behind it. The second part explores the possible physical relevance of GPC. We review the effect of pinning, i.e. the saturation of some GPC by given natural occupation numbers and explain its consequences. Although this effect would be quite spectacular we argue that pinning is unnatural. Instead, we conjecture the effect of quasipinning, defined by occupation numbers close to (but not exactly on) the boundary of the allowed region. In the third part we study concrete fermionic quantum systems from the new viewpoint of GPC. In particular, we compute the natural occupation numbers for the ground state of a family of interacting fermions in a harmonic potential. Intriguingly, we find that the occupation numbers are strongly quasipinned, even up to medium interaction strengths. We identify this as an effect of the lowest few energy eigenstates, which provides first insights into the mechanism behind quasipinning."
851,1506.02635,2015,8,14,17,Strong converse theorems using Rényi entropies,Felix Leditzky;Mark M Wilde;Nilanjana Datta,"We use a Rényi entropy method to prove strong converse theorems for certain information-theoretic tasks which involve local operations and quantum or classical communication between two parties. These include state redistribution, coherent state merging, quantum state splitting, measurement compression with quantum side information, randomness extraction against quantum side information, and data compression with quantum side information. The method we employ in proving these results extends ideas developed by Sharma [arXiv:1404.5940], which he used to give a new proof of the strong converse theorem for state merging. For state redistribution, we prove the strong converse property for the boundary of the entire achievable rate region in the $(e,q)$-plane, where $e$ and $q$ denote the entanglement cost and quantum communication cost, respectively. In the case of measurement compression with quantum side information, we prove a strong converse theorem for the classical communication cost, which is a new result extending the previously known weak converse. For the remaining tasks, we provide new proofs for strong converse theorems previously established using smooth entropies. For each task, we obtain the strong converse theorem from explicit bounds on the figure of merit of the task in terms of a Rényi generalization of the optimal rate. Hence, we identify candidates for the strong converse exponents for each task discussed in this paper. To prove our results, we establish various new entropic inequalities, which might be of independent interest. These involve conditional entropies and mutual information derived from the sandwiched Rényi divergence. In particular, we obtain novel bounds relating these quantities, as well as the Rényi conditional mutual information, to the fidelity of two quantum states."
852,1505.02576,2015,7,2,17,A New Kind of Topological Quantum Order: A Dimensional Hierarchy of Quasiparticles Built from Stationary Excitations,Sagar Vijay;Jeongwan Haah;Liang Fu,"We introduce exactly solvable models of interacting (Majorana) fermions in $d \ge 3$ spatial dimensions that realize a new kind of topological quantum order, building on a model presented in ref. [1]. These models have extensive topological ground-state degeneracy and a hierarchy of point-like, topological excitations that are only free to move within sub-manifolds of the lattice. In particular, one of our models has fundamental excitations that are completely stationary. To demonstrate these results, we introduce a powerful polynomial representation of commuting Majorana Hamiltonians. Remarkably, the physical properties of the topologically-ordered state are encoded in an algebraic variety, defined by the common zeros of a set of polynomials over a finite field. This provides a ""geometric"" framework for the emergence of topological order."
853,1505.01480,2015,6,9,17,Localization from superselection rules in translation invariant systems,Isaac H Kim;Jeongwan Haah,"We study a translation invariant spin model in a three-dimensional regular lattice, called the cubic code model, in the presence of arbitrary extensive perturbations. Below a critical perturbation strength, we show that most states with finite energy are localized; the overwhelming majority of such states have energy concentrated around a finite number of defects, and remain so for a time that is near-exponential in the distance between the defects. This phenomenon is due to an emergent superselection rule and does not require any disorder. An extensive number of local integrals of motion for these finite energy sectors are identified as well. Our analysis extends more generally to systems with immobile topological excitations."
854,1504.06390,2015,5,12,17,Fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for optical quantum key distribution,Masahiro Takeoka;Saikat Guha;Mark M Wilde,"Since 1984, various optical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have been proposed and examined. In all of them, the rate of secret key generation decays exponentially with distance. A natural and fundamental question is then whether there are yet-to-be discovered optical QKD protocols (without quantum repeaters) that could circumvent this rate-distance tradeoff. This paper provides a major step towards answering this question. We show that the secret-key-agreement capacity of a lossy and noisy optical channel assisted by unlimited two-way public classical communication is limited by an upper bound that is solely a function of the channel loss, regardless of how much optical power the protocol may use. Our result has major implications for understanding the secret-key-agreement capacity of optical channels---a long-standing open problem in optical quantum information theory---and strongly suggests a real need for quantum repeaters to perform QKD at high rates over long distances."
855,1504.04217,2015,5,8,17,Quantum and classical coin-flipping protocols based on bit-commitment and their point games,Ashwin Nayak;Jamie Sikora;Levent Tunçel,"We focus on a family of quantum coin-flipping protocols based on bit-commitment. We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of cheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of fidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler semidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming problems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as developed by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and use linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then construct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the analysis for the quantum case. We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum protocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In particular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from classical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from linear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone programming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear programming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is correlated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming models on the optimization side. Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that every classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to entirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum and classical protocols, we show that only ""classical"" protocols can saturate Kitaev's lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of Alice and Bob's optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat with probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from attaining the optimal level of security."
856,1504.03661,2015,4,27,17,Resource convertibility and ordered commutative monoids,Tobias Fritz,"Resources and their use and consumption form a central part of our life. Many branches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which given resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects. For example, information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication channel instance into an exchange of information. Inspired by work in quantum information theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of question. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility of combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids. As an intuitive example, we consider chemistry, where chemical reaction equations such as \[ \mathrm2H_2 + O_2 \to \mathrm2H_2O \]are concerned both with a convertibility relation ""$\to$"" and a combination operation ""$+$"". We study ordered commutative monoids from an algebraic and functional-analytic perspective and derive a wealth of results which should have applications to concrete resource theories, such as a formula for rates of conversion. As a running example showing that ordered commutative monoids are also of purely mathematical interest, we exemplify our results with the ordered commutative monoid of graphs. While closely related to both Girard's linear logic and to Deutsch's constructor theory, our framework also produces results very reminiscent of the utility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern in decision theory and of a theorem of Lieb and Yngvason on thermodynamics. Concerning pure algebra, our observation is that some pieces of algebra can be developed in a context in which equality is not necessarily symmetric, i.e. in which the equality relation is replaced by an ordering relation. For example, notions like cancellativity or torsion-freeness are still sensible and very natural concepts in our ordered setting."

Finding super-sets of the set of separable states that admit a simpler description has proven to be a fruitful approach in the bipartite setting. In this paper we discuss a systematic way of characterizing multiparticle entanglement via various relaxations. We furthermore describe an operational witness construction arising from such relaxations that is capable of detecting every entangled state. Finally, we also derive an analytic upper-bound on the volume of biseparable states and show that the volume of the states with a positive partial transpose for any split rapidly outgrows this volume. This proves that simple semi-definite relaxations in the multiparticle case cannot be an equally good approximation for any scenario."
858,1503.08139,2015,4,15,17,Bounds on entanglement distillation and secret key agreement for quantum broadcast channels,Kaushik P Seshadreesan;Masahiro Takeoka;Mark M Wilde,"The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel is an additive function of quantum channels, which finds application as an upper bound on the rate at which secret key and entanglement can be generated when using a quantum channel a large number of times in addition to unlimited classical communication. This quantity has led to an upper bound of $\log((1+\eta)/(1-\eta))$ on the capacity of a pure-loss bosonic channel for such a task, where $\eta$ is the average fraction of photons that make it from the input to the output of the channel. The purpose of the present paper is to extend these results beyond the single-sender single-receiver setting to the more general case of a single sender and multiple receivers (a quantum broadcast channel). We employ multipartite generalizations of the squashed entanglement to constrain the rates at which secret key and entanglement can be generated between any subset of the users of such a channel, along the way developing several new properties of these measures. We apply our results to the case of a pure-loss broadcast channel with one sender and two receivers."

This makes the need for protocols that verify the correct functionality of quantum operations timely and has led to the field of quantum verification. In this paper we address key challenges to make quantum verification protocols applicable to experimental implementations. We prove the robustness of the single server verifiable universal blind quantum computing protocol of Fitzsimons and Kashefi (2012) in the most general scenario. This includes the case where the purification of the deviated input state is in the hands of an adversarial server. The proved robustness property allows the composition of this protocol with a device-independent state tomography protocol that we give, which is based on the rigidity of CHSH games as proposed by Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013). The resulting composite protocol has lower round complexity for the verification of entangled quantum servers with a classical verifier and, as we show, can be made fault tolerant."

We introduce a versatile and practical method to numerically simulate one-dimensional open quantum many-body dynamics using tensor networks. It is based on representing mixed quantum states in a locally purified form, which guarantees that positivity is preserved at all times. Moreover, the approximation error is controlled with respect to the trace norm. Hence, this scheme overcomes various obstacles of the known numerical open-system evolution schemes. To exemplify the functioning of the approach, we study both stationary states and transient dissipative behaviour, for various open quantum systems ranging from few to many bodies."
861,1412.3634,2014,2,19,17,Quantum learning of classical stochastic processes: The Completely-Positive Realization Problem,Alex Monràs;Andreas Winter,"Among several tasks in Machine Learning, a specially important one is that of inferring the latent variables of a system and their causal relations with the observed behavior. Learning a Hidden Markov Model of given stochastic process is a textbook example, known as the positive realization problem (PRP). The PRP and its solutions have far-reaching consequences in many areas of systems and control theory, and positive systems theory. We consider the scenario where the latent variables are quantum states, and the system dynamics is constrained only by physical transformations on the quantum system. The observable dynamics is then described by a quantum instrument, and the task is to determine which quantum instrument --if any-- yields the process at hand by iterative application. We take as starting point the theory of quasi-realizations, whence a description of the dynamics of the process is given in terms of linear maps on state vectors and probabilities are given by linear functionals on the state vectors. This description, despite its remarkable resemblance with the Hidden Markov Model, or the iterated quantum instrument, is nevertheless devoid of any stochastic or quantum mechanical interpretation, as said maps fail to satisfy any positivity conditions. The Completely-Positive realization problem then consists in determining whether an equivalent quantum mechanical description of the same process exists. We generalize some key results of stochastic realization theory, and show that the problem has deep connections with operator systems theory, yielding possible insight to the lifting problem in quotient operator systems. Our results have potential applications in quantum machine learning, device-independent characterization and reverse-engineering of stochastic processes and quantum processors, and dynamical processes with quantum memory."

Full characterization via quantum process tomography is impractical and often unnecessary. For most practical purposes, it is enough to estimate more general quantities such as the average fidelity. Here we use a unitary 2-design and twirling protocol for efficiently estimating the average fidelity of Clifford gates, to certify a 7-qubit entangling gate in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor. Compared with more than $10^8$ experiments required by full process tomography, we conducted 1656 experiments to satisfy a statistical confidence level of 99%. The average fidelity of this Clifford gate in experiment is 55.1%, and rises to 87.5% if the infidelity due to decoherence is removed. The entire protocol of certifying Clifford gates is efficient and scalable, and can easily be extended to any general quantum information processor with minor modifications."
863,1411.7195,2014,12,19,17,Post-firewall paradoxes,Samuel L Braunstein;Stefano Pirandola,"The preeminent view that evaporating black holes should simply be smaller black holes has been challenged by the firewall paradox. In particular, this paradox suggests that something different occurs once a black hole has evaporated to one-half its original surface area. Here we derive variations of the firewall paradox by tracking the thermodynamic entropy within a black hole across its entire lifetime. Our approach sweeps away many unnecessary assumptions, allowing us to demonstrate a paradox exists even after its initial onset (when conventional assumptions render earlier analyses invalid). Our results suggest that not only is the formation of a firewall the most natural resolution, but provides a mechanism for it. Finally, although firewalls cannot have evolved for modest-sized black holes, within the age of the universe, we speculate on the implications if they were ever unambiguously observed."

For that, we construct a simple PEPS for spin-1/2 particles in a two-dimensional lattice. We reveal a symmetry in the local projector of the PEPS that gives rise to the global topological character. We also extract characteristic quantities of the edge conformal field theory using the bulk-boundary correspondence."

An explicit example of such superactivation for the 1-shot quantum zero-error capacity is constructed for n=3. Some implications of this example and its reformulation on terms of quantum measurements are described.
866,1411.4648,2014,11,27,17,A unifying framework for relaxations of the causal assumptions in Bell's theorem,Rafael Chaves;Richard Kueng;Jonatan Bohr Brask;David Gross,"Bell's Theorem shows that quantum mechanical correlations can violate the constraints that the causal structure of certain experiments impose on any classical explanation. It is thus natural to ask to which degree the causal assumptions -- e.g. locality or measurement independence -- have to be relaxed in order to allow for a classical description of such experiments. Here, we develop a conceptual and computational framework for treating this problem. We employ the language of Bayesian networks to systematically construct alternative causal structures and bound the degree of relaxation using quantitative measures that originate from the mathematical theory of causality. The main technical insight is that the resulting problems can often be expressed as computationally tractable linear programs. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by applying it to a variety of scenarios, ranging from relaxations of the measurement independence, locality and bilocality assumptions, to a novel causal interpretation of CHSH inequality violations."
867,1409.3827,2014,11,25,17,Reexamining classical and quantum models for the D-Wave One processor,Tameem Albash;Troels F Rønnow;Matthias Troyer;Daniel A Lidar,"We revisit the evidence for quantum annealing in the D-Wave One device (DW1) based on the study of random Ising instances. Using the probability distributions of finding the ground states of such instances, previous work found agreement with both simulated quantum annealing (SQA) and a classical rotor model. Thus the DW1 ground state success probabilities are consistent with both models, and a different measure is needed to distinguish the data and the models. Here we consider measures that account for ground state degeneracy and the distributions of excited states, and present evidence that for these new measures neither SQA nor the classical rotor model correlate perfectly with the DW1 experiments. We thus provide evidence that SQA and the classical rotor model, both of which are classically efficient algorithms, do not satisfactorily explain all the DW1 data. A complete model for the DW1 remains an open problem. Using the same criteria we find that, on the other hand, SQA and the classical rotor model correlate closely with each other. To explain this we show that the rotor model can be derived as the semiclassical limit of the spin-coherent states path integral. We also find differences in which set of ground states is found by each method, though this feature is sensitive to calibration errors of the DW1 device and to simulation parameters."
868,1409.2477,2014,11,21,17,Fast Quantum Methods for Optimization,Sergio Boixo;Gerardo Ortiz;Rolando D Somma,"Discrete combinatorial optimization consists in finding the optimal configuration that minimizes a given discrete objective function. An interpretation of such a function as the energy of a classical system allows us to reduce the optimization problem into the preparation of a low-temperature thermal state of the system. Motivated by the quantum annealing method, we present three strategies to prepare the low-temperature state that exploit quantum mechanics in remarkable ways. We focus on implementations without uncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously prove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum mapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial dimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum system also in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show how such a ground state can be prepared by means of quantum annealing, including quantum adiabatic evolutions. This mapping also allows us to unveil some fundamental relations between simulated and quantum annealing. The second strategy builds upon the first one and introduces a technique called spectral gap amplification to reduce the time required to prepare the same quantum state adiabatically. If implemented on a quantum device that exploits quantum coherence, this strategy leads to a quadratic improvement in complexity over the well-known bound of the classical simulated annealing method. The third strategy is not purely adiabatic; instead, it exploits diabatic processes between the low-energy states of the corresponding quantum system. For some problems it results in an exponential speedup (in the oracle model) over the best classical algorithms."

Here we show that such a decrease of information is equivalent to the underlying stochastic evolution being divisible. The main result, which holds for both classical and quantum stochastic processes, rely on a quantum version of the so-called Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem in classical statistics."
870,1408.3193,2014,9,15,17,Quantum lower bound for inverting a permutation with advice,Aran Nayebi;Scott Aaronson;Aleksandrs Belovs;Luca Trevisan,"Given a random permutation $f: [N] \to [N]$ as a black box and $y \in [N]$, we want to output $x = f^{-1}(y)$. Supplementary to our input, we are given classical advice in the form of a pre-computed data structure; this advice can depend on the permutation but \emphnot on the input $y$. Classically, there is a data structure of size $\tilde{O}(S)$ and an algorithm that with the help of the data structure, given $f(x)$, can invert $f$ in time $\tilde{O}(T)$, for every choice of parameters $S$, $T$, such that $S\cdot T \ge N$. We prove a quantum lower bound of $T^2\cdot S \ge \tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon N)$ for quantum algorithms that invert a random permutation $f$ on an $\epsilon$ fraction of inputs, where $T$ is the number of queries to $f$ and $S$ is the amount of advice. This answers an open question of De et al. We also give a $\Omega(\sqrt{N/m})$ quantum lower bound for the simpler but related Yao's box problem, which is the problem of recovering a bit $x_j$, given the ability to query an $N$-bit string $x$ at any index except the $j$-th, and also given $m$ bits of advice that depend on $x$ but not on $j$."

Using spin glass physics and Imry-Ma arguments in addition to numerical benchmarks we quantify the power of such local solution methods and show that for the average low-dimensional spin glass problem outside the spin- glass phase the exact ground state can be found in polynomial time. In the second part we present a heuristic, general-purpose hierarchical approach which for spin glasses on chimera graphs and lattices in two and three dimensions outperforms, to our knowledge, any other solver currently around, with significantly better scaling performance than simulated annealing."
872,1407.6999,2014,9,1,17,Bounds on quantum nonlocality via partial transposition,Karol Horodecki;Gláucia Murta,"We explore the link between two concepts: the level of violation of a Bell inequality by a quantum state and discrimination between two states by means of restricted classes of operations, such as local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable ones. For any bipartite Bell inequality, we show that its value on a given quantum state cannot exceed the classical bound by more than the maximal quantum violation shrunk by a factor related to distinguishability of this state from the separable set by means of some restricted class of operations. We then consider the general scenarios where the parties are allowed to perform a local pre-processing of many copies of the state before the Bell test (asymptotic and hidden-nonlocality scenarios). We define the asymptotic relative entropy of nonlocality and, for PPT states, we bound this quantity by the relative entropy of entanglement of the partially transposed state. The bounds are strong enough to limit the use of certain states containing private key in the device-independent scenario."
873,1407.2713,2014,8,15,17,Order 3 Symmetry in the Clifford Hierarchy,Ingemar Bengtsson;Kate Blanchfield;Earl T Campbell;Mark Howard,"We investigate the action of the first three levels of the Clifford hierarchy on sets of mutually unbiased bases comprising the Ivanovic MUB and the Alltop MUBs. Vectors in the Alltop MUBs exhibit additional symmetries when the dimension is a prime number equal to 1 modulo 3 and thus the set of all Alltop vectors splits into three Clifford orbits. These vectors form configurations with so-called Zauner subspaces, eigenspaces of order 3 elements of the Clifford group highly relevant to the SIC problem. We identify Alltop vectors as the magic states that appear in the context of fault-tolerant universal quantum computing, wherein the appearance of distinct Clifford orbits implies a surprising inequivalence between some magic states."

We then construct a compatible gauging map for operators, which preserves locality and reproduces the minimal coupling scheme for simple operators. By combining this construction with the formalism of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS), we can show that an injective PEPS for the matter fields is gauged into a G-injective PEPS for the combined gauge-matter system, which potentially has topological order. We derive the corresponding parent Hamiltonian, which is a frustration free gauge theory Hamiltonian closely related to the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian at zero coupling constant. We can then introduce gauge dynamics at finite values of the coupling constant by applying a local filtering operation. This scheme results in a low-parameter family of gauge invariant states of which we can accurately probe the phase diagram, as we illustrate by studying a Z2 gauge theory with Higgs matter."
875,1406.2946,2014,7,28,17,Strong converse rates for quantum communication,Marco Tomamichel;Mark M Wilde;Andreas Winter,"We revisit a fundamental open problem in quantum information theory, namely whether it is possible to transmit quantum information at a rate exceeding the channel capacity if we allow for a non-vanishing probability of decoding error. Here we establish that the Rains information of any quantum channel is a strong converse rate for quantum communication: For any sequence of codes with rate exceeding the Rains information of the channel, we show that the fidelity vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. This remains true even if we consider codes that perform classical post-processing on the transmitted quantum data. As an application of this result, for generalized dephasing channels we show that the Rains information is also achievable, and thereby establish the strong converse property for quantum communication over such channels. Thus we conclusively settle the strong converse question for a class of quantum channels that have a non-trivial quantum capacity."
876,1406.1471,2014,7,11,17,Entanglement contour,Yangang Chen;Guifre Vidal,"In the context of characterizing the structure of quantum entanglement in many-body systems, we introduce the entanglement contour, a tool to identify which real-space degrees of freedom contribute, and how much, to the entanglement of a region A with the rest of the system B. The entanglement contour provides a complementary, more re?fined approach to characterizing entanglement than just considering the entanglement entropy between A and B, with several concrete advantages. We illustrate this in the context of ground states and quantum quenches in fermionic quadratic systems. For instance, in a quantum critical system in $D = 1$ spatial dimensions, the entanglement contour allows us to determine the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory from just a single partition of the system into regions A and B, (using the entanglement entropy for the same task requires considering several partitions). In $D \geq 2$ dimensions, the entanglement contour can distinguish between gapped and gapless phases that obey a same boundary law for entanglement entropy. During a local or global quantum quench, the time-dependent contour provides a detailed account of the dynamics of entanglement, including propagating entanglement waves, which offers a microscopic explanation of the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of time."

Rev. Lett. 111, 030502 (2013)] discussing private quantum subsystems. Here we prove several previously presented results, including a condition for a given random unitary channel to not have a private subspace (although this does not mean that private communication cannot occur, as was previously demonstrated via private subsystems) and algebraic conditions that characterize when a general quantum subsystem or subspace code is private for a quantum channel. These conditions can be regarded as the private analogue of the Knill-Laflamme conditions for quantum error correction, and we explore how the conditions simplify in some special cases. The bridge between quantum cryptography and quantum error correction provided by complementary quantum channels motivates the study of a new, more general definition of quantum error correcting code, and we initiate this study here. We also consider the concept of complementarity for the general notion of private quantum subsystem."

Here we study the entropy H and subentropy Q as functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials in the probabilities, and reveal a series of remarkable properties. Derivatives of all orders are shown to satisfy a complete monotonicity property. H and Q themselves become multivariate Bernstein functions and we derive the density functions of their Levy-Khintchine representations. We also show that H and Q are Pick functions in each symmetric polynomial variable separately. Furthermore we see that H and the intrinsically quantum informational quantity Q become surprisingly closely related in functional form, suggesting a special significance for the symmetric polynomials in quantum information theory. Using the symmetric polynomials we also derive a series of further properties of H and Q."

A logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the corresponding logarithmic Sobolev constant can be inferred from the semigroup's hypercontractive norm bound. We consider completely-positive quantum mechanical semigroups described by a Lindblad master equation. To prove the norm bound, we follow an approach which has its roots in the study of classical rate equations. We use interpolation theorems for non-commutative $L_p$ spaces to obtain a general hypercontractive inequality from a particular $p \rightarrow q$-norm bound. Then, we derive a bound on the $2 \rightarrow 4$-norm from an analysis of the block diagonal structure of the semigroup's spectrum. We show that the dynamics of an $N$-qubit graph state Hamiltonian weakly coupled to a thermal environment is hypercontractive. As a consequence this allows for the efficient preparation of graph states in time ${\rm poly}(\log(N))$ by coupling at sufficiently low temperature. Furthermore, we extend our results to gapped Liouvillians arising from a weak linear coupling of a free-fermion systems."
880,1403.4228,2014,5,9,17,Consistency Tests of Classical and Quantum Models for a Quantum Annealer,Tameem Albash;Walter Vinci;Anurag Mishra;Paul A Warburton;Daniel A Lidar,"Recently the question of whether the D-Wave processors exhibit large-scale quantum behavior or can be described by a classical model has attracted significant interest. In this work we address this question by studying a 503 qubit D-Wave Two device in the ""black box"" model, i.e., by studying its input-output behavior. Our work generalizes an approach introduced in Boixo et al. [Nat. Commun. 4, 2067 (2013)], and uses groups of up to 20 qubits to realize a transverse Ising model evolution with a ground state degeneracy whose distribution acts as a sensitive probe that distinguishes classical and quantum models for the D-Wave device. Our findings rule out all classical models proposed to date for the device and provide evidence that an open system quantum dynamical description of the device that starts from a quantized energy level structure is well justified, even in the presence of relevant thermal excitations and a small value of the ratio of the single-qubit decoherence time to the annealing time."
881,1402.4175,2014,5,1,17,Perturbation Theory for Parent Hamiltonians of Matrix Product States,Oleg Szehr;Michael M Wolf,"This article investigates the stability of the ground state subspace of a canonical parent Hamiltonian of a Matrix product state against local perturbations. We prove that the spectral gap of such a Hamiltonian remains stable under weak local perturbations even in the thermodynamic limit, where the entire perturbation might not be bounded. Our discussion is based on preceding work by D.A. Yarotsky that develops a perturbation theory for relatively bounded quantum perturbation of classical Hamiltonians. We exploit a renormalization procedure, which on large scale transforms the parent Hamiltonian of a Matrix product state into a classical Hamiltonian plus some perturbation. We can thus extend D.A. Yarotsky's results to provide a perturbation theory for parent Hamiltonians of Matrix product states and recover some of the findings of independent contributions by S. Michalakis et al. [arXiv:1109.1588] and J. I. Cirac et al. [arXiv:1306.4003]."

The quantum query complexity of Element Distinctness is known to be $\Theta(N^{2/3})$; the polynomial method gives a tight lower bound for any input alphabet, while a tight adversary construction was only known for alphabets of size $\Omega(N^2)$. We construct a tight $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ adversary lower bound for Element Distinctness with minimal non-trivial alphabet size, which equals the length of the input. This result may help to improve lower bounds for other related query problems."

Here we show how to define and measure quantum speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the question posed."

885,1311.5212,2013,1,17,17,Robust quantum data locking from phase modulation,Cosmo Lupo;Mark M Wilde;Seth Lloyd,"Quantum data locking is a unique quantum phenomenon that allows a relatively short key to (un)lock an arbitrarily long message encoded in a quantum state, in such a way that an eavesdropper who measures the state but does not know the key has essentially no information about the encrypted message. The application of quantum data locking in cryptography would allow one to overcome the limitations of the one-time pad encryption, which requires the key to have the same length as the message. However, it is known that the strength of quantum data locking is also its Achilles heel, as the leakage of a few bits of the key or the message may in principle allow the eavesdropper to unlock a disproportionate amount of information. In this paper we show that there exist quantum data locking schemes that can be made robust against information leakage by increasing the length of the shared key by a proportionate amount. This implies that a constant size key can still encrypt an arbitrarily long message as long as a fraction of it remains secret to the eavesdropper. Moreover, we greatly simplify the structure of the protocol by proving that phase modulation suffices to generate strong locking schemes, paving the way to optical experimental realizations. Also, we show that successful data locking protocols can be constructed using random codewords, which very well could be helpful in discovering random codes for data locking over noisy quantum channels."
886,1311.4547,2013,1,14,17,True randomness from realistic quantum devices,Daniela Frauchiger;Renato Renner;Matthias Troyer,"Even if the output of a Random Number Generator (RNG) is perfectly uniformly distributed, it may be correlated to pre-existing information and therefore be predictable. Statistical tests are thus not sufficient to guarantee that an RNG is usable for applications, e.g., in cryptography or gambling, where unpredictability is important. To enable such applications a stronger notion of randomness, termed ""true randomness"", is required, which includes independence from prior information. Quantum systems are particularly suitable for true randomness generation, as their unpredictability can be proved based on physical principles. Practical implementations of Quantum RNGs (QRNGs) are however always subject to noise, i.e., influences which are not fully controlled. This reduces the quality of the raw randomness generated by the device, making it necessary to post-process it. Here we provide a framework to analyse realistic QRNGs and to determine the post-processing that is necessary to turn their raw output into true randomness."

This paradigm is known as asymptotic state discrimination, and we derive necessary conditions for when two multipartite states of any size can be discriminated perfectly by asymptotic LOCC. We use this new criterion to prove a gap in the LOCC and separable distinguishability norms. We then turn to the operational advantage of using two-way classical communication over one-way communication in LOCC processing. With a simple two-qubit product state ensemble, we demonstrate a strict majorization of the two-way LOCC norm over the one-way norm."

Here I show that their group of transversal gates is optimal and only depends on the spatial dimension, not the local geometry. I also introduce a generalized, subsystem version of color codes. In 3D they allow the transversal implementation of a universal set of gates by gauge fixing, while error-detecting measurements involve only 4 or 6 qubits."

Thus proposed cryptosystems based on the presumed hardness of discrete logarithms in semigroups are insecure against quantum attacks. In contrast, we show that some generalizations of the discrete log problem are hard in semigroups despite being easy in groups. We relate a shifted version of the discrete log problem in semigroups to the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, and we show that the constructive membership problem with respect to $k \ge 2$ generators in a black-box abelian semigroup of order $N$ requires $\tilde \Theta(N^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2k}})$ quantum queries."
890,1310.5372,2013,11,20,17,An Almost Sudden Jump in Quantum Complexity,Or Sattath,"The Quantum Satisfiability problem (QSAT) is the generalization of the canonical NP-complete problem - Boolean Satisfiability. (k,s)-QSAT is the following variant of the problem: given a set of projectors of rank 1, acting non-trivially on k qubits out of n qubits, such that each qubit appears in at most s projectors, decide whether there exists a quantum state in the null space of all the projectors. Let f*(k) be the maximal integer s such that every (k,s)-QSAT instance is satisfiable. Deciding (k,f*(k))-QSAT is computationally easy: by definition the answer is ""satisfiable"". But, by relaxing the conditions slightly, we show that (k,f*(k)+2)-QSAT is QMA_1-hard, for k >=15. This is a quantum analogue of a classical result by Kratochvíl et al. [KST93]. We use the term ""an almost sudden jump"" to stress that the complexity of (k,f*(k)+1)-QSAT is open, where the jump in the classical complexity is known to be sudden. We present an implication of this finding to the quantum PCP conjecture, arguably one of the most important open problems in the field of Hamiltonian complexity. Our implications impose constraints on one possible way to refute the quantum PCP."
891,1310.1037,2013,11,8,17,Generating topological order: no speedup by dissipation,Robert Koenig;Fernando Pastawski,"We consider the problem of preparing topologically ordered states using unitary and non-unitary circuits, as well as local time-dependent Hamiltonian and Liouvillian evolutions. We prove that for any topological code in $D$ dimensions, the time required to encode logical information into the ground space is at least $\Omega(d^{1/(D-1)})$, where $d$ is the code distance. This result is tight for the toric code, giving a scaling with the linear system size. More generally, we show that the linear scaling is necessary even when dropping the requirement of encoding: preparing any state close to the ground space using dissipation takes an amount of time proportional to the diameter of the system in typical 2D topologically ordered systems, as well as for example the 3D and 4D toric codes."
892,1310.1036,2013,11,6,17,An optimal dissipative encoder for the toric code,John Dengis;Robert Koenig;Fernando Pastawski,"We consider the problem of preparing specific encoded resource states for the toric code by local, time-independent interactions with a memoryless environment. We propose a construction of such a dissipative encoder which converts product states to topologically ordered ones while preserving logical information. The corresponding Liouvillian is made up of four-local Lindblad operators. For a qubit lattice of size $L\times L$, we show that this process prepares encoded states in time $O(L)$, which is optimal. This scaling compares favorably with known local unitary encoders for the toric code which take time of order $\Omega(L^2)$ and require active time-dependent control."
893,1309.3228,2013,10,24,17,Quantum hypothesis testing and the operational interpretation of the quantum Renyi relative entropies,Milán Mosonyi;Tomohiro Ogawa,"We show that the new quantum extension of Renyi's \alpha-relative entropies, introduced recently by Muller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J. Math. Phys. 54, 122203, (2013), and Wilde, Winter, Yang, Commun. Math. Phys. 331, (2014), have an operational interpretation in the strong converse problem of quantum hypothesis testing. Together with related results for the direct part of quantum hypothesis testing, known as the quantum Hoeffding bound, our result suggests that the operationally relevant definition of the quantum Renyi relative entropies depends on the parameter \alpha: for \alpha<1, the right choice seems to be the traditional definition, whereas for \alpha>1 the right choice is the newly introduced version. As a sideresult, we show that the new Renyi \alpha-relative entropies are asymptotically attainable by measurements for \alpha>1, and give a new simple proof for their monotonicity under completely positive trace-preserving maps."

By this equivalence, we can systematically construct a fault-tolerant HQC scheme, which can geometrically implement a universal set of encoded quantum gates by adiabatically deforming the system Hamiltonian. During this process, quantum information is protected from low weight thermal excitations by an energy gap that does not change with the problem size."
895,1308.0312,2013,10,4,17,de Finetti reductions for correlations,Rotem Arnon-Friedman;Renato Renner,"When analysing quantum information processing protocols one has to deal with large entangled systems, each consisting of many subsystems. To make this analysis feasible, it is often necessary to identify some additional structure. de Finetti theorems provide such a structure for the case where certain symmetries hold. More precisely, they relate states that are invariant under permutations of subsystems to states in which the subsystems are independent of each other. This relation plays an important role in various areas, e.g., in quantum cryptography or state tomography, where permutation invariant systems are ubiquitous. The known de Finetti theorems usually refer to the internal quantum state of a system and depend on its dimension. Here we prove a different de Finetti theorem where systems are modelled in terms of their statistics under measurements. This is necessary for a large class of applications widely considered today, such as device independent protocols, where the underlying systems and the dimensions are unknown and the entire analysis is based on the observed correlations."
896,1307.5368,2013,10,4,17,Quantum enigma machines and the locking capacity of a quantum channel,Saikat Guha;Patrick Hayden;Hari Krovi;Seth Lloyd;Cosmo Lupo;Jeffrey H Shapiro;Masahiro Takeoka;Mark M Wilde,"The locking effect is a phenomenon which is unique to quantum information theory and represents one of the strongest separations between the classical and quantum theories of information. The Fawzi-Hayden-Sen (FHS) locking protocol harnesses this effect in a cryptographic context, whereby one party can encode n bits into n qubits while using only a constant-size secret key. The encoded message is then secure against any measurement that an eavesdropper could perform in an attempt to recover the message, but the protocol does not necessarily meet the composability requirements needed in quantum key distribution applications. In any case, the locking effect represents an extreme violation of Shannon's classical theorem, which states that information-theoretic security holds in the classical case if and only if the secret key is the same size as the message. Given this intriguing phenomenon, it is of practical interest to study the effect in the presence of noise, which can occur in the systems of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. This paper formally defines the locking capacity of a quantum channel as the maximum amount of locked information that can be reliably transmitted to a legitimate receiver by exploiting many independent uses of a quantum channel and an amount of secret key sublinear in the number of channel uses. We provide general operational bounds on the locking capacity in terms of other well-known capacities from quantum Shannon theory. We also study the important case of bosonic channels, finding limitations on these channels' locking capacity when coherent-state encodings are employed and particular locking protocols for these channels that might be physically implementable."
897,1305.5278,2013,9,13,17,The second laws of quantum thermodynamics,Fernando G S L Brandão;Michał Horodecki;Nelly Huei Ying Ng;Jonathan Oppenheim;Stephanie Wehner,"The second law of thermodynamics tells us which state transformations are so statistically unlikely that they are effectively forbidden. Its original formulation, due to Clausius, states that ""Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time"". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles interacting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics in the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we find that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a very di?erent form than it does at the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state transformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In particular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are not only relevant for small systems, but also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take on a simple form with the first law defining the class of thermal operations, the zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory is nontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our generalised free energies."
898,1304.2807,2013,9,9,18,Quantum circuit optimization by topological compaction in the surface code,Adam Paetznick;Austin G Fowler,"The fragile nature of quantum information limits our ability to construct large quantities of quantum bits suitable for quantum computing. An important goal, therefore, is to minimize the amount of resources required to implement quantum algorithms, many of which are serial in nature and leave large numbers of qubits idle much of the time unless compression techniques are used. Furthermore, quantum error-correcting codes, which are required to reduce the effects of noise, introduce additional resource overhead. We consider a strategy for quantum circuit optimization based on topological deformation in the surface code, one of the best performing and most practical quantum error-correcting codes. Specifically, we examine the problem of minimizing computation time on a two-dimensional qubit lattice of arbitrary, but fixed dimension, and propose two algorithms for doing so."

For example, dislocations in the toric code model are known as twists and possess properties that are analogous to Ising anyons. We strengthen this analogy by using the topological entanglement entropy as a diagnostic tool to identify properties of both defects and excitations in the toric code. Specifically, we show, through explicit calculation, that the toric code model including twists and dyon excitations has the same quantum dimensions, the same total quantum dimension, and the same fusion rules as an Ising anyon model."

Because software can, in principle, be copied, general one-time programs exists only in the hardware token model: it has been shown that any function admits a one-time program as long as we assume access to physical devices called one-time memories. Quantum information, with its well-known property of no-cloning, would, at first glance, prevent the basic copying attack for classical programs. We show that this intuition is false: one-time programs for both classical and quantum maps, based solely on quantum information, do not exist, even with computational assumptions. We complement this strong impossibility proof by an equally strong possibility result: assuming the same basic one-time memories as used for classical one-time programs, we show that every quantum map has a quantum one-time program that is secure in the universal composability framework. Our construction relies on a new, simpler quantum authentication scheme and corresponding mechanism for computing on authenticated data."

Our method is inspired by a set of results from quantum information known as quantum de Finetti theorems. In particular, we prove a de Finetti theorem for a special class of real symmetric matrices to establish the existence of approximate representing measures for moment matrix relaxations."

903,1511.08710,2015,3,20,16,Assessing the performance of quantum repeaters for all phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channels,Kenneth Goodenough;David Elkouss;Stephanie Wehner,"One of the most sought-after goals in experimental quantum communication is the implementation of a quantum repeater. The performance of quantum repeaters can be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private capacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way communication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the search for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these capacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels allow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding capacities. Here, we exploit this idea to obtain bounds for any phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channel. This bound allows one to benchmark the implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels used to model communication across fibers. In particular, our bound is applicable to the realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on the input. Furthermore, we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is convex in the set of channels, and we use a connection between the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical capacity. Building on this connection, we obtain the exact squashed entanglement and two-way assisted capacities of the $d$-dimensional erasure channel and bounds on the amplitude-damping channel and all qubit Pauli channels. In particular, our bound improves on the previous best known squashed entanglement upper bound of the depolarizing channel."

In particular, we show that any orthonormal basis of a real vector space of dimension d^2-1 corresponds to some general SIC POVM and vice versa. Our constructed set of all general SIC-POVMs contains weak SIC-POVMs for which each POVM element can be made arbitrarily close to a multiple times the identity. On the other hand, it remains open if for all finite dimensions our constructed family contains a rank 1 SIC-POVM."

Similarly to the classical problem 2-SAT, the counting problem #2-QSAT of determining the size (i.e. the dimension) of the set of satisfying states is #P-complete. However, if we consider random instances of #2-QSAT in which constraints are sampled from the Haar measure, intractible instances have measure zero. An apparent reason for this is that almost all two-qubit constraints are entangled, which more readily give rise to long-range constraints. We investigate under which conditions product constraints also give rise to efficiently solvable families of #2-QSAT instances. We consider #2-QSAT involving only discrete distributions over tensor product operators, which interpolates between classical #2-SAT and #2-QSAT involving arbitrary product constraints. We find that such instances of #2-QSAT, defined on Erdos--Renyi graphs or bond-percolated lattices, are asymptotically almost surely efficiently solvable except to the extent that they are biased to resemble monotone instances of #2-SAT."

It is therefore important to determine exactly what is needed for proof-of-principle experiments, which will be the first major step towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we propose an experiment using the smallest surface code that would allow errors to be detected and corrected for both the $X$ and $Z$ basis of a qubit. This requires $17$ physical qubits initially prepared in a product state, on which $16$ two-qubit entangling gates are applied before a final measurement of all qubits. Using a realistic error model, it is found that this set-up could successfully demonstrate error correction with two qubit gate fidelities greater that $91\%$ and mesurement fidelities greater than $96 \%$. Fidelities of greater than $99\%$, however, are required to demonstrate a more convincing route to scalability."

Our algorithm uses quadratically fewer steps than a random walk on the grid, ignoring logarithmic factors.

Recently, it has also been proposed as a reguralizer for low-rank matrix recovery. The norm constants that bound the diamond norm in terms of the nuclear norm (also known as trace norm) are explicitly known. This note provides a simple characterization of all operators saturating the upper and the lower bound."

It is known that the one-shot tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC convertibility is completely determined by the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state, i.e. the largest Schmidt rank of those bipartite states lying in the range of the reduced density operator. In this paper, we obtain results in tripartite-to-bipartite entanglement transformation, in both finite and asymptotic settings, by studying properties of the maximal Schmidt rank. In the finite setting, we first show that the maximal Schmidt rank is super-multiplicative, i.e., the maximal Schmidt rank of two copies of a given state can be strictly larger than the square of its maximal Schmidt rank. We then provide a complete characterization of those tripartite states satisfying this property. Note that such tripartite states admit advantages in tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC transformation when multiple copies are supplied. In the asymptotic setting, we introduce the asymptotic maximal Schmidt rank of a tri- partite state, which can be understood as the largest possible Schmidt rank one can obtain from a single copy of the given tripartite state under SLOCC, asymptotically. We first compute the asymptotic maximal Schmidt rank for a large family of tripartite states explicitly. Then, combined with certain powerful results from invariant theory, we exhibit a sufficient and necessary condition to determine whether a single copy of a given tripartite state can be transformed to the bipartite maximally entangled state under SLOCC, in this asymptotic setting. Thanks to the recent progress on the non-commutative rank problem, our condition can be verified in deterministic polynomial time."
911,1612.03908,2016,12,31,16,Modeling coherent errors in quantum error correction,Daniel Greenbaum;Zachary Dutton,"Analysis of quantum error correcting codes is typically done using a stochastic, Pauli channel error model for describing the noise on physical qubits. However, it was recently found that coherent errors (systematic rotations) on physical data qubits result in both physical and logical error rates that differ significantly from those predicted by a Pauli model. Here we examine the accuracy of the Pauli approximation for coherent errors on data qubits under the repetition code. We analytically evaluate the logical error as a function of concatenation level and code distance. We find that coherent errors result in logical errors that are partially coherent and therefore non-Pauli. However, the coherent part of the error is negligible after two or more concatenation levels or at fewer than $\epsilon^{-(d-1)}$ error correction cycles, where $\epsilon \ll 1$ is the rotation angle error per cycle for a single physical qubit and $d$ is the code distance. These results lend support to the validity of modeling coherent errors using a Pauli channel under some minimum requirements for code distance and/or concatenation."

Motivated by recent advances in reversible logic synthesis, we synthesize arithmetic circuits using classical design automation flows and tools. The combination of classical and reversible logic synthesis enables the automatic design of large components in reversible logic starting from well-known hardware description languages such as Verilog. As a prototype example for our approach we automatically generate high quality networks for the reciprocal $1/x$, which is necessary for quantum linear systems algorithms."

Specifically, we formulate a quantum Cramer-Rao lower bound for estimating the single parameter in any one-parameter family of spacetime metrics. We employ the locally covariant formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, which allows for a manifestly background-independent derivation. The result is an uncertainty relation that applies to all globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Among other examples, we apply our method to detection of gravitational waves using the electromagnetic field as a probe, as in laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Other applications are discussed, from terrestrial gravimetry to cosmology."

Our main tool is the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which we use as a simple model of a black hole. We use an analytically continued partition function $|Z(\beta +it)|^2$ as well as correlation functions as diagnostics. Using numerical techniques we establish random matrix behavior at late times. We determine the early time behavior exactly in a double scaling limit, giving us a plausible estimate for the crossover time to random matrix behavior. We use these ideas to formulate a conjecture about general large AdS black holes, like those dual to 4D super-Yang-Mills theory, giving a provisional estimate of the crossover time. We make some preliminary comments about challenges to understanding the late time dynamics from a bulk point of view."

In this work we show that, if we keep the first group of postulates, all the alternatives to the second group are in correspondence with a class of representations of the unitary group. Some features of these alternative probabilistic theories are identical to quantum theory, but there are important differences in others. For example, some theories have three perfectly distinguishable states in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Others have exotic properties such as lack of ""bit symmetry"", the violation of ""no simultaneous encoding"" (a property similar to information causality) and the existence of maximal measurements without phase groups. We also show that pure-state bit symmetry and no restriction of effects single out the Born rule in finite dimensions."

We consider three different models. In the first, the Quantum Circuit Model (QCM), in addition to the single qubit and CNOT gates, qubits can be traced out. In the second (RandomQCM), we also allow external classical randomness. In the third (MeasuredQCM) we also allow measurements followed by operations that are classically controlled on the outcomes. We give near-optimal decompositions in almost all cases. Our main result is a MeasuredQCM circuit for any channel from m qubits to n qubits that uses at most one ancilla and has a low CNOT count. We give explicit examples for small numbers of qubits illustrating the improvements offered by our schemes."

Furthermore, we show that, under local isometry, the players' measurements in said entangled strategy must be $O(\mathrm{poly}(n\varepsilon))$ close to the ""ideal"" strategy when acting on the shared state."

The so-called fractionalized edge mode of an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1 chain in a rotationally-symmetric Haldane phase can be used to measure the direction of an unknown electric field, by exploiting the way in which the field direction reduces the symmetry of the chain. Specifically, the direction of the field is registered in the holonomy under an adiabatic sensing protocol, and the degenerate fractionalized edge mode is protected through this process by the remaining reduced symmetry. We illustrate the scheme with respect to a potential realization by Rydberg dressed atoms."

We then establish a normal form of such channels: any passively dilatable channel is the result of applying passive unitaries to the input and output of a Gaussian additive channel. The latter combine the state of the system with that of the environment by means of a multi-mode beamsplitter."

This becomes a primitive in a protocol that foliates a series of such cluster states into a much larger cluster state, implementing foliated quantum error correction. We exemplify this construction with several familiar quantum error correction codes, and propose a generic method for decoding foliated codes. We numerically evaluate the error-correction performance of a family of finite-rate CSS codes known as turbo codes, finding that it performs well over moderate depth foliations. Foliated codes have applications for quantum repeaters and fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation."

We show that the proposed measure operationally quantifies the minimal amount of squeezing needed to prepare a given quantum state and that it can be regarded as a squeezing analogue of the ""entanglement of formation"". We prove that the measure is convex and superadditive and we provide analytic bounds as well as a numerical convex optimisation algorithm for its computation. By example, we then show that the amount of squeezing needed for the preparation of certain multi-mode quantum states can be significantly lower than naive approaches suggest."

We characterize those states which can be reached from some other state via Local Operations assisted by finitely many rounds of Classical Communication ($LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}$). For qubits we show that this set of states is of measure zero, which implies that the maximally entangled set is generically of full measure if restricted to the practical scenario of finite-round LOCC. Moreover, we identify a class of states for which any $LOCC_{\mathbb{N}}$ protocol can be realized via a concatenation of deterministic steps. We show, however, that in general there exist state transformations which require a probabilistic step within the protocol, which highlights the difference between bipartite and multipartite LOCC."

In this work, we present a framework describing the mixing properties of continuous-time unitary evolutions originating from local Hamiltonians having time-fluctuating terms, reflecting a Brownian motion on the unitary group. The induced stochastic time evolution is shown to converge to a unitary design. As a first main result, we present bounds to the mixing time. By developing tools in representation theory, we analytically derive an expression for a local k-th moment operator that is entirely independent of k, giving rise to approximate unitary k-designs and quantum tensor product expanders. As a second main result, we introduce tools for proving bounds on the rate of decoupling from an environment with random quantum processes. By tying the mathematical description closely with the more established one of random quantum circuits, we present a unified picture for analysing local random quantum and classes of Markovian dissipative processes, for which we discuss applications."

Optimal quantum protocols for this task have been given by Aharon and Silman (New Journal of Physics, 2010) but are based on optimal weak coin-flipping protocols which are currently very complicated and not very well understood. In this paper, we first present very simple classical protocols for die-rolling which have decent (and sometimes optimal) security which is in stark contrast to coin-flipping, bit-commitment, oblivious transfer, and many other two-party cryptographic primitives. We also present quantum protocols based on integer-commitment, a generalization of bit-commitment, where one wishes to commit to an integer. We analyze these protocols using semidefinite programming and finally give protocols which are very close to Kitaev's lower bound for any $D \geq 3$. Lastly, we briefly discuss an application of this work to the quantum state discrimination problem."

Existing resource theories give us partial answers; however, these rely on idealizations, like perfectly independent copies of states or exact knowledge of a quantum state. Here we introduce the general tool of currencies to quantify realistic descriptions of resources, applicable in experimental settings when we do not have perfect control over a physical system, when only the neighbourhood of a state or some of its properties are known, or when there is no obvious way to decompose a global space into subsystems. Currencies are a special set of resources chosen to quantify all others - like Bell pairs in LOCC or a lifted weight in thermodynamics. We show that from very weak assumptions on the theory we can already find useful currencies that give us necessary and sufficient conditions for resource conversion, and we build up more results as we impose further structure. This work is an application of Resource theories of knowledge [arXiv:1511.08818], generalizing axiomatic approaches to thermodynamic entropy, work and currencies made of local copies."

The primary tool employed is dynamic application of a local, unitary operator which exchanges defects and thereby translates localized excitations. Crucially, the protocol does not require any measurements of stabilizer operators, and therefore can be used to enhance the lifetime of a qubit in the absence of such experimental resources."
929,1603.02940,2016,5,27,16,Quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling and hitting-time estimation,Anirban Narayan Chowdhury;Rolando D Somma,"We present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic processes. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum system and runs in time almost linear in $\sqrt{N \beta/{\cal Z}}$ and polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the Hilbert space dimension, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, ${\cal Z}$ is the partition function, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision of the output state. Our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ and quadratically improves the dependence on $\beta$ of known quantum algorithms for this problem. The second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain. For a sparse stochastic matrix $P$, it runs in time almost linear in $1/(\epsilon \Delta^{3/2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the absolute precision in the estimation and $\Delta$ is a parameter determined by $P$, and whose inverse is an upper bound of the hitting time. Our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ and $1/\Delta$ of the analog classical algorithm for hitting-time estimation. Both algorithms use tools recently developed in the context of Hamiltonian simulation, spectral gap amplification, and solving linear systems of equations."

Sets of regular and irregular LDPC codes with different code rates over the Galois fields $GF(8)$, $GF(16)$, $GF(32)$, and $GF(64)$ have been constructed. We have performed simulations to analyze the efficiency and the frame error rate using the sum-product algorithm.

In 2010 Klartag and Regev demonstrated such a function and asked, whether there existed a function with an efficient quantum simultaneous-messages protocol, but still no efficient classical two-way protocol. In this work we answer the latter question affirmatively and present a partial function Shape, which can be computed by a protocol sending entangled simultaneous messages of poly-logarithmic size, and whose classical two-way complexity is lower bounded by a polynomial."
932,1512.07550,2015,3,17,16,Optimizing the Number of Gates in Quantum Search,Srinivasan Arunachalam;Ronald de Wolf,"$ $In its usual form, Grover's quantum search algorithm uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries and $O(\sqrt{N} \log N)$ other elementary gates to find a solution in an $N$-bit database. Grover in 2002 showed how to reduce the number of other gates to $O(\sqrt{N}\log\log N)$ for the special case where the database has a unique solution, without significantly increasing the number of queries. We show how to reduce this further to $O(\sqrt{N}\log^{(r)} N)$ gates for any constant $r$, and sufficiently large $N$. This means that, on average, the gates between two queries barely touch more than a constant number of the $\log N$ qubits on which the algorithm acts. For a very large $N$ that is a power of 2, we can choose $r$ such that the algorithm uses essentially the minimal number $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ of queries, and only $O(\sqrt{N}\log(\log^{\star} N))$ other gates."

In this paper we show that Lieb's function admits an explicit semidefinite programming formulation for any rational $t \in [0,1]$. Our construction makes use of a semidefinite formulation of weighted matrix geometric means. We provide an implementation of our constructions in Matlab."

A small system thermalizes to this ensemble while exchanging heat and particles with a bath. A quantum system may exchange quantities represented by operators that fail to commute. Whether such a system thermalizes and what form the thermal state has are questions about truly quantum thermodynamics. Here we investigate this thermal state from three perspectives. First, we introduce an approximate microcanonical ensemble. If this ensemble characterizes the system-and-bath composite, tracing out the bath yields the system's thermal state. This state is expected to be the equilibrium point, we argue, of typical dynamics. Finally, we define a resource-theory model for thermodynamic exchanges of noncommuting observables. Complete passivity---the inability to extract work from equilibrium states---implies the thermal state's form, too. Our work opens new avenues into equilibrium in the presence of quantum noncommutation."
935,1511.07084,2015,2,17,16,Nested Quantum Annealing Correction,Walter Vinci;Tameem Albash;Daniel A Lidar,"We present a general error-correcting scheme for quantum annealing that allows for the encoding of a logical qubit into an arbitrarily large number of physical qubits. Given any Ising model optimization problem, the encoding replaces each logical qubit by a complete graph of degree $C$, representing the distance of the error-correcting code. A subsequent minor-embedding step then implements the encoding on the underlying hardware graph of the quantum annealer. We demonstrate experimentally that the performance of a D-Wave Two quantum annealing device improves as $C$ grows. We show that the performance improvement can be interpreted as arising from an effective increase in the energy scale of the problem Hamiltonian, or equivalently, an effective reduction in the temperature at which the device operates. The number $C$ thus allows us to control the amount of protection against thermal and control errors, and in particular, to trade qubits for a lower effective temperature that scales as $C^{-\eta}$, with $\eta \leq 2$. This effective temperature reduction is an important step towards scalable quantum annealing."
936,1511.06991,2015,12,24,16,The performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm on spike Hamiltonians,Linghang Kong;Elizabeth Crosson,"Perturbed Hamming weight problems serve as examples of optimization instances for which the adiabatic algorithm provably out performs classical simulated annealing. In this work we study the efficiency of the adiabatic algorithm for solving the ""the Hamming weight with a spike"" problem by using several methods to compute the scaling of the spectral gap at the critical point, which apply for various ranges of the height and width of the barrier. Our main result is a rigorous polynomial lower bound on the minimum spectral gap for the adiabatic evolution when the bit-symmetric cost function has a thin but polynomially high barrier. This is accomplished by the use of a variational argument with an improved ansatz for the ground state, along with a comparison to the spectrum of the system when no spike term is present. We also give a more detailed treatment of the spin coherent path-integral instanton method which was used by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann in arXiv:quant-ph/0201031, and consider its applicability for estimating the gap for different scalings of barrier height and width. We adapt the discrete WKB method for an abruptly changing potential, and apply it to the construction of approximate wave functions which can be used to estimate the gap. Finally, the improved ansatz for the ground state leads to a method for predicting the location of avoided crossings in the excited states of the energy spectrum of the thin spike Hamiltonian, and we use a recursion relation to determine the ordering of some of these avoided crossings, which may be a useful step towards understanding the diabatic cascade phenomenon which occurs in spike Hamiltonians."
937,1511.04874,2015,12,11,16,Operational Interpretation of Renyi Information Measures via Composite Hypothesis Testing Against Product and Markov Distributions,Marco Tomamichel;Masahito Hayashi,"We revisit the problem of asymmetric binary hypothesis testing against a composite alternative hypothesis. We introduce a general framework to treat such problems when the alternative hypothesis adheres to certain axioms. In this case we find the threshold rate, the optimal error and strong converse exponents (at large deviations from the threshold) and the second order asymptotics (at small deviations from the threshold). We apply our results to find operational interpretations of various Renyi information measures. In case the alternative hypothesis is comprised of bipartite product distributions, we find that the optimal error and strong converse exponents are determined by variations of Renyi mutual information. In case the alternative hypothesis consists of tripartite distributions satisfying the Markov property, we find that the optimal exponents are determined by variations of Renyi conditional mutual information. In either case the relevant notion of Renyi mutual information depends on the precise choice of the alternative hypothesis. As such, our work also strengthens the view that different definitions of Renyi mutual information, conditional entropy and conditional mutual information are adequate depending on the context in which the measures are used."

939,1510.04702,2015,11,24,16,Bounds on the power of proofs and advice in general physical theories,Ciarán M Lee;Matty J Hoban,"Quantum theory presents us with the tools for computational and communication advantages over classical theory. One approach to uncovering the source of these advantages is to determine how computation and communication power vary as quantum theory is replaced by other operationally-defined theories from a broad framework of such theories. Such investigations may reveal some of the key physical features required for powerful computation and communication. In this paper we investigate how simple physical principles bound the power of two different computational paradigms which combine computation and communication in a non-trivial fashion: computation with advice and interactive proof systems. We show that the existence of non-trivial dynamics in a theory implies a bound on the power of computation with advice. Moreover, we provide an explicit example of a theory with no non-trivial dynamics in which the power of computation with advice is unbounded. Finally we show that the power of simple interactive proof systems in theories where local measurements suffice for tomography is non-trivially bounded. This result provides a proof that QMA is contained in PP which does not make use of any uniquely quantum structure - such as the fact that observables correspond to self-adjoint operators - and thus may be of independent interest."
940,1510.03784,2015,11,24,16,Bidirectional holographic codes and sub-AdS locality,Zhao Yang;Patrick Hayden;Xiao-Liang Qi,"Tensor networks implementing quantum error correcting codes have recently been used to construct toy models of holographic duality explicitly realizing some of the more puzzling features of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These models reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for boundary intervals, and allow bulk operators to be mapped to the boundary in a redundant fashion. These exactly solvable, explicit models have provided valuable insight but nonetheless suffer from many deficiencies, some of which we attempt to address in this article. We propose a new class of tensor network models that subsume the earlier advances and, in addition, incorporate additional features of holographic duality, including: (1) a holographic interpretation of all boundary states, not just those in a ""code"" subspace, (2) a set of bulk states playing the role of ""classical geometries"" which reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for boundary intervals, (3) a bulk gauge symmetry analogous to diffeomorphism invariance in gravitational theories, (4) emergent bulk locality for sufficiently sparse excitations, and (5) the ability to describe geometry at sub-AdS resolutions or even flat space."
941,1510.02736,2015,11,17,16,Informational completeness in bounded-rank quantum-state tomography,Charles H Baldwin;Ivan H Deutsch;Amir Kalev,"We consider the problem of quantum-state tomography under the assumption that the state is pure, and more generally that its rank is bounded by a given value. In this scenario, new notions of informationally complete POVMs emerge, which allow for high-fidelity state estimation with fewer measurement outcomes than are required for an arbitrary rank state. We study this in the context of matrix completion, where the POVM outcomes determine only a few of the density matrix elements. We give an analytic solution that fully characterizes informational completeness and elucidates the important role that the positive-semidefinite property of density matrices plays in tomography. We show how positivity can impose a stricter notion of information completeness and allow us to use convex optimization programs to robustly estimate bounded-rank density matrices in the presence of statistical noise."
942,1509.06763,2015,11,11,16,"Practical, Reliable Error Bars in Quantum Tomography",Philippe Faist;Renato Renner,"Precise characterization of quantum devices is usually achieved with quantum tomography. However, most methods which are currently widely used in experiments, such as maximum likelihood estimation, lack a well-justified error analysis. Promising recent methods based on confidence regions are difficult to apply in practice or yield error bars which are unnecessarily large. Here, we propose a practical yet robust method for obtaining error bars. We do so by introducing a novel representation of the output of the tomography procedure, the ""quantum error bars"". This representation is (i) concise, being given in terms of few parameters, (ii) intuitive, providing a fair idea of the ""spread"" of the error, and (iii) useful, containing the necessary information for constructing confidence regions. The statements resulting from our method are formulated in terms of a figure of merit, such as the fidelity to a reference state. We present an algorithm for computing this representation and provide ready-to-use software. Our procedure is applied to actual experimental data obtained from two superconducting qubits in an entangled state, demonstrating the applicability of our method."

Except for a relatively few number of models which are analytically tractable, much of the physics of anyons remain still unexplored. In this paper, we show how U(1)-symmetry can be combined with the previously proposed anyonic Matrix Product States to simulate ground states and dynamics of anyonic systems on a lattice at any rational particle number density. We provide proof of principle by studying itinerant anyons on a one dimensional chain where no natural notion of braiding arises and also on a two-leg ladder where the anyons hop between sites and possibly braid. We compare the result of the ground state energies of Fibonacci anyons against hardcore bosons and spinless fermions. In addition, we report the entanglement entropies of the ground states of interacting Fibonacci anyons on a fully filled two-leg ladder at different interaction strength, identifying gapped or gapless points in the parameter space. As an outlook, our approach can also prove useful in studying the time dynamics of a finite number of nonabelian anyons on a finite two-dimensional lattice."

This was first studied in the pioneering work of Shannon who established a simple expression characterizing this quantity in the limit of multiple independent uses of the channel. Here we consider the general setting with only one use of the channel. We observe that the maximum success probability can be expressed as the maximum value of a submodular function. Using this connection, we establish the following results: 1. There is a simple greedy polynomial-time algorithm that computes a code achieving a (1-1/e)-approximation of the maximum success probability. Moreover, for this problem it is NP-hard to obtain an approximation ratio strictly better than (1-1/e). 2. Shared quantum entanglement between the sender and the receiver can increase the success probability by a factor of at most 1/(1-1/e). In addition, this factor is tight if one allows an arbitrary non-signaling box between the sender and the receiver. 3. We give tight bounds on the one-shot performance of the meta-converse of Polyanskiy-Poor-Verdu."

Motivated by questions in thermodynamics, our relation describes the transitions induced by bistochastic maps in the presence of additional auxiliary systems which may become correlated in the process. We show that this relation is completely characterized by Shannon entropy H, which yields an interpretation of H in resource-theoretic terms, and admits a particularly simple proof of a known characterization of H in terms of natural information-theoretic properties."

A question of fundamental importance is to understand how many resources, which we quantify by the dimension of the underlying quantum system, are needed to reproduce this correlation. In this Letter, we identify an easy-to-compute lower bound on the smallest Hilbert space dimension needed to generate a given two-party quantum correlation. We show that our bound is tight on many well-known correlations and discuss how it can rule out correlations of having a finite-dimensional quantum representation. We show that our bound is multiplicative under product correlations and also that it can witness the non-convexity of certain restricted-dimensional quantum correlations."
949,1506.04150,2015,8,18,16,From the Kochen-Specker theorem to noncontextuality inequalities without assuming determinism,Ravi Kunjwal;Robert W Spekkens,"The Kochen-Specker theorem demonstrates that it is not possible to reproduce the predictions of quantum theory in terms of a hidden variable model where the hidden variables assign a value to every projector deterministically and noncontextually. A noncontextual value-assignment to a projector is one that does not depend on which other projectors - the context - are measured together with it. Using a generalization of the notion of noncontextuality that applies to both measurements and preparations, we propose a scheme for deriving inequalities that test whether a given set of experimental statistics is consistent with a noncontextual model. Unlike previous inequalities inspired by the Kochen-Specker theorem, we do not assume that the value-assignments are deterministic and therefore in the face of a violation of our inequality, the possibility of salvaging noncontextuality by abandoning determinism is no longer an option. Our approach is operational in the sense that it does not presume quantum theory: a violation of our inequality implies the impossibility of a noncontextual model for any operational theory that can account for the experimental observations, including any successor to quantum theory."
950,1506.02228,2015,8,17,16,Strong converse exponents for the feedback-assisted classical capacity of entanglement-breaking channels,Dawei Ding;Mark M Wilde,"Quantum entanglement can be used in a communication scheme to establish a correlation between successive channel inputs that is impossible by classical means. It is known that the classical capacity of quantum channels can be enhanced by such entangled encoding schemes, but this is not always the case. In this paper, we prove that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of an entanglement-breaking channel even when it is assisted by a classical feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. In doing so, we identify a bound on the strong converse exponent, which determines the exponentially decaying rate at which the success probability tends to zero, for a sequence of codes with communication rate exceeding capacity. Proving a strong converse, along with an achievability theorem, shows that the classical capacity is a sharp boundary between reliable and unreliable communication regimes. One of the main tools in our proof is the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy. The same method of proof is used to derive an exponential bound on the success probability when communicating over an arbitrary quantum channel assisted by classical feedback, provided that the transmitter does not use entangled encoding schemes."

For 2D color codes, Delfosse relaxed the constraint on translation invariance and mapped a 2D color code onto three surface codes. In this paper, we propose an alternate map based on linear algebra. We show that any 2D color code can be mapped onto exactly two copies of a related surface code. The surface code in our map is induced by the color code and easily derived from the color code. Furthermore, our map does not require any ancilla qubits for the surface codes."

The difficulty is making scalable entangled resource states that are robust to errors. We propose an anonymous broadcasting protocol that uses a continuous-variable toric-code state, which can be produced using current technology. High squeezing enables large transmission bandwidth and strong anonymity, and the topological nature of the state enables local error correction."
953,1502.05326,2015,7,2,16,Superadditivity of private information for any number of uses of the channel,David Elkouss;Sergii Strelchuk,"The quantum capacity of a quantum channel is always smaller than the capacity of the channel for private communication. However, both quantities are given by the infinite regularization of respectively the coherent and the private information. Here, we construct a family of channels for which the private and coherent information can remain strictly superadditive for unbounded number of uses. We prove this by showing that the coherent information is strictly larger than the private information of a smaller number of uses of the channel. This implies that even though the quantum capacity is upper bounded by the private capacity, the non-regularized quantities can be interleaved. From an operational point of view, the private capacity can be used for gauging the practical value of quantum channels for secure communication and, consequently, for key distribution. We thus show that in order to evaluate the interest a channel for this task it is necessary to optimize the private information over an unlimited number of uses of the channel."
954,1502.04433,2015,6,16,16,A Classical Analog to Entanglement Reversibility,Eric Chitambar;Ben Fortescue;Min-Hsiu Hsieh,"In this letter we introduce the problem of secrecy reversibility. This asks when two honest parties can distill secret bits from some tripartite distribution $p_{XYZ}$ and transform secret bits back into $p_{XYZ}$ at equal rates using local operation and public communication (LOPC). This is the classical analog to the well-studied problem of reversibly concentrating and diluting entanglement in a quantum state. We identify the structure of distributions possessing reversible secrecy when one of the honest parties holds a binary distribution, and it is possible that all reversible distributions have this form. These distributions are more general than what is obtained by simply constructing a classical analog to the family of quantum states known to have reversible entanglement. An indispensable tool used in our analysis is a conditional form of the Gács-Körner Common Information."
955,1502.03010,2015,6,9,16,Verifying the quantumness of a channel with an untrusted device,Matthew F Pusey,"Suppose one wants to certify that a quantum channel is not entanglement-breaking. I consider all four combinations of trusted and untrusted devices at the input and output of the channel, finding that the most interesting is a trusted preparation device at the input and an untrusted measurement device at the output. This provides a time-like analogue of EPR-steering, which turns out to reduce to the problem of joint measurability, connecting these concepts in a different way to other recent work. I suggest a few applications of this connection, such as a resource theory of incompatibility. This perspective also sheds light on why the BB84 key distribution protocol can be secure even with an untrusted measuring device, leading to an uncertainty relation for arbitrary pairs of ensembles."

An $r$-fold version of the traditional definition of minimum positive semidefinite rank of a graph using Hermitian matrices that fit the graph is also presented. This paper also introduces $r$-fold orthogonal representations of graphs and formalizes the understanding of projective rank as fractional orthogonal rank. Connections of these concepts to quantum theory, including Tsirelson's problem, are discussed."
957,1501.06855,2015,3,11,16,Hierarchy of efficiently computable and faithful lower bounds to quantum discord,Marco Piani,"Quantum discord expresses a fundamental non-classicality of correlations more general than quantum entanglement. We combine the no-local-broadcasting theorem, semidefinite-programming characterizations of quantum fidelity and quantum separability, and a recent breakthrough result of Fawzi and Renner about quantum Markov chains to provide a hierarchy of computationally efficient lower bounds to quantum discord. Such a hierarchy converges to the surprisal of measurement recoverability introduced by Seshadreesan and Wilde, and provides a faithful lower bound to quantum discord already at the lowest non-trivial level. Furthermore, the latter constitutes by itself a valid discord-like measure of the quantumness of correlations."
958,1412.7637,2014,3,4,16,The Computational Power of Non-interacting Particles,Daniel J Brod,"Shortened abstract: In this thesis, I study two restricted models of quantum computing related to free identical particles. Free fermions correspond to a set of two-qubit gates known as matchgates. Matchgates are classically simulable when acting on nearest neighbors on a path, but universal for quantum computing when acting on distant qubits or when SWAP gates are available. I generalize these results in two ways. First, I show that SWAP is only one in a large family of gates that uplift matchgates to quantum universality. In fact, I show that the set of all matchgates plus any nonmatchgate parity-preserving two-qubit gate is universal, and interpret this fact in terms of local invariants of two-qubit gates. Second, I investigate the power of matchgates in arbitrary connectivity graphs, showing they are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and classically simulable on a cycle. I also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction. Free bosons give rise to a model known as BosonSampling. BosonSampling consists of (i) preparing a Fock state of n photons, (ii) interfering these photons in an m-mode linear interferometer, and (iii) measuring the output in the Fock basis. Sampling approximately from the resulting distribution should be classically hard, under reasonable complexity assumptions. Here I show that exact BosonSampling remains hard even if the linear-optical circuit has constant depth. I also report several experiments where three-photon interference was observed in integrated interferometers of various sizes, providing some of the first implementations of BosonSampling in this regime. The experiments also focus on the bosonic bunching behavior and on validation of BosonSampling devices. This thesis contains descriptions of the numerical analyses done on the experimental data, omitted from the corresponding publications."
959,1411.4248,2014,2,17,16,Fault-tolerant Holonomic Quantum Computation in Surface Codes,Yi-Cong Zheng;Todd A Brun,"We show that universal holonomic quantum computation (HQC) can be achieved fault-tolerantly by adiabatically deforming the gapped stabilizer Hamiltonian of the surface code, where quantum information is encoded in the degenerate ground space of the system Hamiltonian. We explicitly propose procedures to perform each logical operation, including logical state initialization, logical state measurement, logical CNOT, state injection and distillation,etc. In particular, adiabatic braiding of different types of holes on the surface leads to a topologically protected, non-Abelian geometric logical CNOT. Throughout the computation, quantum information is protected from both small perturbations and low weight thermal excitations by a constant energy gap, and is independent of the system size. Also the Hamiltonian terms have weight at most four during the whole process. The effect of thermal error propagation is considered during the adiabatic code deformation. With the help of active error correction, this scheme is fault-tolerant, in the sense that the computation time can be arbitrarily long for large enough lattice size. It is shown that the frequency of error correction and the physical resources needed can be greatly reduced by the constant energy gap."
960,1410.8067,2014,2,11,16,Classical correlation alone supplies the anomaly to weak values,Christopher Ferrie;Joshua Combes,"The question of what is genuinely quantum about weak values is only ever going to elicit strongly subjective opinions---it is not a scientific question. Good questions, when comparing theories, are operational---they deal with the unquestionable outcomes of experiment. We give the anomalous shift of weak values an objective meaning through a generalization to an operational definition of anomalous post-selected averages. We show the presence of these averages necessitate correlations in every model giving rise to them---quantum or classical. Characterizing such correlations shows that they are ubiquitous. We present the simplest classical example without the need of disturbance realizing these generalized anomalous weak values."
961,1410.6220,2014,2,3,16,Quantum algorithms for shortest paths problems in structured instances,Aran Nayebi;Virginia Vassilevska Williams,"We consider the quantum time complexity of the all pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem and some of its variants. The trivial classical algorithm for APSP and most all pairs path problems runs in $O(n^3)$ time, while the trivial algorithm in the quantum setting runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$ time, using Grover search. A major open problem in classical algorithms is to obtain a truly subcubic time algorithm for APSP, i.e. an algorithm running in $O(n^{3-\varepsilon})$ time for constant $\varepsilon>0$. To approach this problem, many truly subcubic time classical algorithms have been devised for APSP and its variants for structured inputs. Some examples of such problems are APSP in geometrically weighted graphs, graphs with small integer edge weights or a small number of weights incident to each vertex, and the all pairs earliest arrivals problem. In this paper we revisit these problems in the quantum setting and obtain the first nontrivial (i.e. $O(n^{2.5-\varepsilon})$ time) quantum algorithms for the problems."

This model has found numerous applications in many areas of computer science. One question that has received a lot of attention recently is whether it is possible to perform such protocols in a private way. We show that defining privacy for quantum protocols is not so straightforward and it depends on whether we assume that the registers where Alice and Bob receive their classical inputs are in fact classical registers (and hence unentangled with the rest of the protocol) or quantum registers (and hence can be entangled with the rest of the protocol or the environment). We provide new quantum protocols for the Inner Product function and for Private Information Retrieval, and show that the privacy assuming classical input registers can be exponentially smaller than the privacy assuming quantum input registers. We also argue that the right notion of privacy of a communication protocol is the one assuming classical input registers, since otherwise the players can deviate considerably from the protocol."
963,1409.5436,2014,12,25,16,Classifying symmetry-protected topological phases through the anomalous action of the symmetry on the edge,Dominic V Else;Chetan Nayak,"It is well known that (1+1)-D bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with symmetry group $G$ can be identified by the projective representation of the symmetry at the edge. Here, we generalize this result to higher dimensions. We assume that the representation of the symmetry on the spatial edge of a ($d+1$)-D SPT is /local/ but not necessarily /on-site/, such that there is an obstruction to its implementation on a region with boundary. We show that such obstructions are classified by the cohomology group $H^{d+1}(G, U(1))$, in agreement with the classification of bosonic SPT phases proposed in [Chen et al, Science 338, 1604 (2012)]. Our analysis allows for a straightforward calculation of the element of $H^{d+1}(G, U(1))$ corresponding to physically meaningful models such as non-linear sigma models with a theta term in the action. SPT phases outside the classification of Chen et al are those in which the symmetry cannot be represented locally on the edge. With some modifications, our framework can also be applied to fermionic systems in (2+1)-D."

It is known that some constructions are quantum-proof whereas others are provably not [Gavinsky \it et al., STOC'07]. We argue that the theory of operator spaces offers a natural framework for studying to what extent extractors are secure against quantum adversaries: we first phrase the definition of extractors as a bounded norm condition between normed spaces, and then show that the presence of quantum adversaries corresponds to a completely bounded norm condition between operator spaces. From this we show that very high min-entropy extractors as well as extractors with small output are always (approximately) quantum-proof. We also study a generalization of extractors called randomness condensers. Again, we phrase the definition of condensers as a bounded norm condition and the definition of quantum-proof condensers as a completely bounded norm condition. Seeing condensers as bipartite graphs, we then find that the bounded norm condition corresponds to an instance of a well studied combinatorial problem, called bipartite densest subgraph. Furthermore, using the characterization in terms of operator spaces, we can associate to any condenser a Bell inequality (two-player game) such that classical and quantum strategies are in one-to-one correspondence with classical and quantum attacks on the condenser. Hence, we get for every quantum-proof condenser a Bell inequality that can not be violated by quantum mechanics."

Recent years have seen a tremendous progress in approaching these questions, not least due to experiments with cold atoms and trapped ions in instances of quantum simulations. This article provides an overview on the progress in understanding dynamical equilibration and thermalisation of closed quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium due to quenches, ramps and periodic driving. It also addresses topics such as the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localisation, universality near phase transitions, and prospects for quantum simulations."

We show that the ensemble of thermal states monotonically approaches the unitarily invariant ensemble with decreasing temperature if all particles interact according to a single random interaction and achieves a state $t$-design at temperature $O(1/\log(t))$. For the system where the random interactions are local, we show that the ensemble achieves a state $1$-design. We then provide numerical evidence indicating that the ensemble undergoes a phase transition at finite temperature."

Causal structures can be modeled using directed acyclic graphs, where nodes represent variables and edges denote functional dependencies. In this work, we describe a general algorithm for computing information-theoretic constraints on the correlations that can arise from a given interaction pattern, where we allow for classical as well as quantum variables. We apply the general technique to two relevant cases: First, we show that the principle of information causality appears naturally in our framework and go on to generalize and strengthen it. Second, we derive bounds on the correlations that can occur in a networked architecture, where a set of few-body quantum systems is distributed among a larger number of parties."

In our formalism, the ground states of an ensemble of non-Hermitian Feynman Clock Hamiltonians yield stochastic trajectories, which unravel the evolution of a Lindblad master equation. In this way, one can use Feynman's Clock not only to simulate the evolution of a quantum system, but also it's interaction with an environment such as a heat bath or measuring apparatus. A simple numerical example of a two-level atom undergoing spontaneous emission is presented and analyzed."

Yet given correlations between just two classical variables, it is impossible to determine whether they arose from a causal influence of one on the other or a common cause influencing both, unless one can implement a randomized intervention. We here consider the problem of causal inference for quantum variables. We introduce causal tomography, which unifies and generalizes conventional quantum tomography schemes to provide a complete solution to the causal inference problem using a quantum analogue of a randomized trial. We furthermore show that, in contrast to the classical case, observed quantum correlations alone can sometimes provide a solution. We implement a quantum-optical experiment that allows us to control the causal relation between two optical modes, and two measurement schemes -- one with and one without randomization -- that extract this relation from the observed correlations. Our results show that entanglement and coherence, known to be central to quantum information processing, also provide a quantum advantage for causal inference."

A complete picture of quantum thermodynamics allows for catalysts, i.e., systems facilitating state transformations while remaining essentially intact in their state, very much reminding of catalysts in chemical reactions. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the power and limitation of such thermal catalysis. Specifically, we provide a family of optimal catalysts that can be returned with minimal trace distance error after facilitating a state transformation process. To incorporate the genuine physical role of a catalyst, we identify very significant restrictions on arbitrary state transformations under dimension or mean energy bounds, using methods of convex relaxations. We discuss the implication of these findings on possible thermodynamic state transformations in the quantum regime."

Quantumness is here intended in the sense of minimum average disturbance under local measurements. We consider a very general framework, but focus on local complete von Neumann measurements as cause of the disturbance, and, later on, on the trace-distance as quantifier of the disturbance. We discuss connections with entanglement and previously defined notions of quantumness of correlations. We prove that a large class of quantifiers of the quantumness of correlations are entanglement monotones for pure bipartite states. In particular, we define an entanglement of disturbance for pure states, for which we give an analytical expression. Such a measure coincides with negativity and concurrence for the case of two qubits. We compute general bounds on disturbance for both single states and ensembles, and consider several examples, including the uniform Haar ensemble of pure states, and pairs of qubit states. Finally, we show that the notion of ensemble quantumness of correlations is most relevant in quantum data hiding. Indeed, while it is known that entanglement is not necessary for a good quantum data hiding scheme, we prove that ensemble quantumness of correlations is."

They are ground states of two different kinds of Hamiltonians. The first one, $\mathcal H_\mathrm{ff}$, is local, frustration-free, and gapless. It can be interpreted as describing a quantum phase transition between different topological phases. The second one, $\mathcal H_\mathrm{fb}$ is gapped, and has hopping terms scaling as $1/r^3$ with the distance $r$. The gap is robust against local perturbations, which allows us to define a Chern number for the PEPS. As for (non-chiral) topological PEPS, the non-trivial topological properties can be traced down to the existence of a symmetry in the virtual modes that are used to build the state. Based on that symmetry, we construct string-like operators acting on the virtual modes that can be continuously deformed without changing the state. On the torus, the symmetry implies that the ground state space of the local parent Hamiltonian is two-fold degenerate. By adding a string wrapping around the torus one can change one of the ground states into the other. We use the special properties of PEPS to build the boundary theory and show how the symmetry results in the appearance of chiral modes, and a universal correction to the area law for the zero Rényi entropy."
974,1404.6311,2014,7,16,16,Quantum criticality from Ising model on fractal lattices,Beni Yoshida;Aleksander Kubica,"We study the quantum Ising model on the Sierpiński triangle, whose Hausdorff dimension is $\log 3/ \log 2 \approx 1.585$, and demonstrate that it undergoes second-order phase transition with scaling relations satisfied precisely. We also study the quantum $3$-state Potts model on the Sierpiński triangle and find first-order phase transition, which is consistent with a prediction from $\epsilon$-expansion that the transition becomes first-order for $D > 1.3$. We then compute critical exponents of the Ising model on higher-dimensional Sierpiński pyramids with various Hausdorff dimension via Monte-Carlo simulations and real-space RG analysis for $D\in[1,3]$. We find that only the correlation length exponent $\nu$ interpolates the values of integer-dimensional models. This implies that, contrary to a generally held belief, the universality class of quantum phase transition may not be uniquely determined by symmetry and spatial dimension of the system. This work initiates studies on quantum critical phenomena on graphs and networks which may be of significant importance in the context of quantum networks and communication."

We illustrate our method by means of Kitaev toric code, defected-lattice code, topological subsystem code and Haah 3D code. The protocol is local whenever in a given code the crossings between the logical operators consist of next neighbour pairs, which holds for the above codes. For subsystem code we also present scheme in a noisy case, where we allow for bit and phase-flip errors on qubits as well as state preparation and syndrome measurement errors. Similar scheme can be built for two other codes. We show that the fidelity of the protected qubit in the noisy scenario in a large code size limit is of $1-\mathcal{O}(p)$, where $p$ is a probability of error on a single qubit. Regarding Haah code we provide noiseless scheme, leaving the noisy case as an open problem."

We demand locality, but allow the walk to vary periodically on a small scale. By constructing lattice Hamiltonians exhibiting Dirac points in their dispersion relations and exploiting the linear behaviour near a Dirac point, we develop algorithms that solve the problem in a time of $O(\sqrt N)$ for $d>2$ and $O(\sqrt N \log N)$ in $d=2$. In particular, we show that such algorithms exist even for hypercubic lattices in any dimension. Unlike previous continuous-time quantum walk algorithms on hypercubic lattices in low dimensions, our approach does not use external memory."

The relations are formulated in terms of a directly operational quantity, namely the probability of distinguishing the actual operation of a device from its hypothetical ideal, by any possible testing procedure whatsoever. Moreover, they may be directly applied in information processing settings, for example to infer that devices which can faithfully transmit information regarding one observable do not leak any information about conjugate observables to the environment. Though intuitively apparent from Heisenberg's original arguments, only more limited versions of this statement have previously been formalized."

However, very little is known about their mathematical structure beyond three qubits. We present several new results about qubit unextendible product bases, including a complete characterization of all four-qubit unextendible product bases, which we show there are exactly 1446 of.

If the protocol is implemented using a single photon source, it can have a key generation rate faster than the repetition rate of the source, enabling faster secure communication than is possible with existing protocols. Further, we provide a proof that the protocol is secure and give a method of implementing the protocol using line-of-sight and fiber optic channels."

We perform an in-depth study of a particular example that can be thought of as an extension to Arikan's polar code. Notably, our numerical simulation show that this code polarizes the logical channels more strongly while retaining the log-linear decoding complexity using the successive cancellation decoder. These codes also display improved error-correcting capability with only a minor impact on decoding complexity. Efficient decoding is realized using powerful graphical calculus tools developed in the field of quantum many-body physics. In a companion paper, we generalize our construction to the quantum setting and describe more in-depth the relation between classical and quantum error correction and the graphical calculus of tensor networks."

The main aim of the notes is to give an introduction to the mathematical methods used in describing discrete quantum systems consisting of infinitely many sites. Such systems can be used, for example, to model the materials in condensed matter physics. The notes provide the necessary background material to access recent literature in the field. Some of these recent results are also discussed. The contents are roughly as follows: (1) quick recap of essentials from functional analysis, (2) introduction to operator algebra, (3) algebraic quantum mechanics, (4) infinite systems (quasilocal algebra), (5) KMS and ground states, (6) Lieb-Robinson bounds, (7) algebraic quantum field theory, (8) superselection sectors of the toric code, (9) Haag-Ruelle scattering theory in spin systems, (10) applications to gapped phases.

Phenomena inherent to quantum theory on curved space-time, such as Hawking radiation, are typically assumed to be only relevant at extreme physical conditions: at high energies and in strong gravitational fields. Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the presence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal coupling between internal degrees of freedom and the centre-of-mass of a composite particle. The resulting correlations cause decoherence of the particle's position, even without any external environment. We also show that the weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to decohere micron scale objects. Gravity therefore can account for the emergence of classicality and the effect can in principle be tested in future matter wave experiments."

We address the problem of compiling single-qubit quantum operations into braid representations for non-abelian quasiparticles described by the Fibonacci anyon model. We develop a probabilistically polynomial algorithm that outputs a braid pattern to approximate a given single-qubit unitary to a desired precision. We also classify the single-qubit unitaries that can be implemented exactly by a Fibonacci anyon braid pattern and present an efficient algorithm to produce their braid patterns. Our techniques produce braid patterns that meet the uniform asymptotic lower bound on the compiled circuit depth and thus are depth-optimal asymptotically. Our compiled circuits are significantly shorter than those output by prior state-of-the-art methods, resulting in improvements in depth by factors ranging from 20 to 1000 for precisions ranging between $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-30}$."

This article investigates the roles of quantum mechanics and computation in free will. Although quantum mechanics implies that events are intrinsically unpredictable, the `pure stochasticity' of quantum mechanics adds only randomness to decision making processes, not freedom. By contrast, the theory of computation implies that even when our decisions arise from a completely deterministic decision-making process, the outcomes of that process can be intrinsically unpredictable, even to -- especially to -- ourselves. I argue that this intrinsic computational unpredictability of the decision making process is what give rise to our impression that we possess free will. Finally, I propose a `Turing test' for free will: a decision maker who passes this test will tend to believe that he, she, or it possesses free will, whether the world is deterministic or not."
985,1310.0129,2013,1,23,16,The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel,Masahiro Takeoka;Saikat Guha;Mark M Wilde,"This paper defines the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel as the maximum squashed entanglement that can be registered by a sender and receiver at the input and output of a quantum channel, respectively. A new subadditivity inequality for the original squashed entanglement measure of Christandl and Winter leads to the conclusion that the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel is an additive function of a tensor product of any two quantum channels. More importantly, this new subadditivity inequality, along with prior results of Christandl, Winter, et al., establishes the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel as an upper bound on the quantum communication capacity of any channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward classical communication. A similar proof establishes this quantity as an upper bound on the private capacity of a quantum channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward public classical communication. This latter result is relevant as a limitation on rates achievable in quantum key distribution. As an important application, we determine that these capacities can never exceed log((1+eta)/(1-eta)) for a pure-loss bosonic channel for which a fraction eta of the input photons make it to the output on average. The best known lower bound on these capacities is equal to log(1/(1-eta)). Thus, in the high-loss regime for which eta << 1, this new upper bound demonstrates that the protocols corresponding to the above lower bound are nearly optimal."

More general 2+1D bosonic topologically ordered states can be constructed via exact soluble string-net models. However, the most important topologically ordered phases of matter are arguably the fermionic fractional quantum Hall states. Topological phases of matter for fermion systems are strictly richer than their bosonic counterparts because locality has different meanings for the two kinds of systems. In this paper, we describe a simple fermionic version of the toric code model to illustrate many salient features of fermionic exactly soluble models and fermionic topologically ordered states."

This model is in part motivated by the fact that decoherence times of qubits are typically small, so it makes sense to parallelize quantum algorithms as much as possible. We show tight bounds for a number of problems, specifically Theta((n/p)^2/3) p-parallel queries for element distinctness and Theta((n/p)^k/(k+1) for k-sum. Our upper bounds are obtained by parallelized quantum walk algorithms, and our lower bounds are based on a relatively small modification of the adversary lower bound method, combined with recent results of Belovs et al. on learning graphs. We also prove some general bounds, in particular that quantum and classical p-parallel complexity are polynomially related for all total functions f when p is small compared to f's block sensitivity."

Recently, protocols to achieve this on classical computing systems have been found. Here we present an efficient solution to the quantum analogue of this problem that enables arbitrary quantum computations to be carried out on encrypted quantum data. We prove that an untrusted server can implement a universal set of quantum gates on encrypted quantum bits (qubits) without learning any information about the inputs, while the client, knowing the decryption key, can easily decrypt the results of the computation. We experimentally demonstrate, using single photons and linear optics, the encryption and decryption scheme on a set of gates sufficient for arbitrary quantum computations. Because our protocol requires few extra resources compared to other schemes it can be easily incorporated into the design of future quantum servers. These results will play a key role in enabling the development of secure distributed quantum systems."

To access the regime of large code distances where logical errors are extremely unlikely we adopt the splitting method widely used in Monte Carlo simulations of rare events and Bennett's acceptance ratio method for estimating the free energy difference between two canonical ensembles. To illustrate the power of these methods in the context of error correction, we calculate the logical error probability $P_L$ for the 2D surface code on a square lattice with a pair of holes for all code distances $d\le 20$ and all error rates $p$ below the fault-tolerance threshold. Our numerical results confirm the expected exponential decay $P_L\sim \exp{[-\alpha(p)d]}$ and provide a simple fitting formula for the decay rate $\alpha(p)$. Both noiseless and noisy syndrome readout circuits are considered."

The additivity conjecture was disproved initially by Hastings. Later, a proof via asymptotic geometric analysis was presented by Aubrun, Szarek and Werner, which uses Dudley's bound on Gaussian process (or Dvoretzky's theorem with Schechtman's improvement). In this paper, we develop another proof along Dvoretzky's theorem in Milman's view showing additivity violation in broader regimes than the existing proofs. Importantly, Dvoretzky's theorem works well with norms to give strong statements but these techniques can be extended to functions which have norm-like structures - positive homogeneity and triangle inequality. Then, a connection between Hastings' method and ours is also discussed. Besides, we make some comments on relations between regularized minimum output entropy and classical capacity of quantum channels."
992,1307.0632,2013,9,25,16,Decoupling with random quantum circuits,Winton Brown;Omar Fawzi,"Decoupling has become a central concept in quantum information theory with applications including proving coding theorems, randomness extraction and the study of conditions for reaching thermal equilibrium. However, our understanding of the dynamics that lead to decoupling is limited. In fact, the only families of transformations that are known to lead to decoupling are (approximate) unitary two-designs, i.e., measures over the unitary group which behave like the Haar measure as far as the first two moments are concerned. Such families include for example random quantum circuits with O(n^2) gates, where n is the number of qubits in the system under consideration. In fact, all known constructions of decoupling circuits use \Omega(n^2) gates. Here, we prove that random quantum circuits with O(n log^2 n) gates satisfy an essentially optimal decoupling theorem. In addition, these circuits can be implemented in depth O(log^3 n). This proves that decoupling can happen in a time that scales polylogarithmically in the number of particles in the system, provided all the particles are allowed to interact. Our proof does not proceed by showing that such circuits are approximate two-designs in the usual sense, but rather we directly analyze the decoupling property."

Specifically, we consider PEPS, which are believed to provide an efficient description, based on local tensors, for the low energy physics arising from local interactions. In order to assess stability in the framework of PEPS, one thus needs to understand how physically allowed perturbations of the local tensor affect the properties of the global state. In this paper, we show that a restricted version of the Local Topological Quantum Order (LTQO) condition provides a checkable criterion which allows to assess the stability of local properties of PEPS under physical perturbations. We moreover show that LTQO itself is stable under perturbations which preserve the spectral gap, leading to nontrivial examples of PEPS which possess LTQO and are thus stable under arbitrary perturbations."
994,1306.1586,2013,8,29,16,Strong converse for the classical capacity of entanglement-breaking and Hadamard channels via a sandwiched Renyi relative entropy,Mark M Wilde;Andreas Winter;Dong Yang,"A strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of a quantum channel states that the probability of correctly decoding a classical message converges exponentially fast to zero in the limit of many channel uses if the rate of communication exceeds the classical capacity of the channel. Along with a corresponding achievability statement for rates below the capacity, such a strong converse theorem enhances our understanding of the capacity as a very sharp dividing line between achievable and unachievable rates of communication. Here, we show that such a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of all entanglement-breaking channels and all Hadamard channels (the complementary channels of the former). These results follow by bounding the success probability in terms of a ""sandwiched"" Renyi relative entropy, by showing that this quantity is subadditive for all entanglement-breaking and Hadamard channels, and by relating this quantity to the Holevo capacity. Prior results regarding strong converse theorems for particular covariant channels emerge as a special case of our results."

This enables noise-resistant implementation of a limited set of operations by braiding and fusing Majorana fermions. Unfortunately, these operations are incapable of implementing universal quantum computation. We show that, regardless of these limitations, Majorana fermions could be used to demonstrate non-locality (correlations incompatible with a local hidden variable theory) in experiments using only topologically protected operations. We also demonstrate that our proposal is optimal in terms of resources, with 10 Majorana fermions shown to be both necessary and sufficient for demonstrating bipartite non-locality. Furthermore, we identify severe restrictions on the possibility of tripartite non-locality. We comment on the potential of such entangled systems to be used in quantum information protocols."

Given oracle access to f(x+s) for a known Boolean function f, the task is to determine the n-bit string s. The quantum query complexity of this problem depends strongly on f. We demonstrate that the easiest instances of this problem correspond to bent functions, in the sense that an exact one-query algorithm exists if and only if the function is bent. We partially characterize the hardest instances, which include delta functions. Moreover, we show that the problem is easy for random functions, since two queries suffice. Our algorithm for random functions is based on performing the pretty good measurement on several copies of a certain state; its analysis relies on the Fourier transform. We also use this approach to improve the quantum rejection sampling approach to the Boolean hidden shift problem."

The inequality is tight in the sense that equality can be attained for any prescribed value of the entropy difference, both for quantum and classical systems. We outline implications for information theory and thermodynamics, such as a necessary condition for a process to be close to thermodynamic reversibility, or an easily computable lower bound on the classical channel capacity. Furthermore, we derive a tight upper bound, uniform for all states of a given dimension, on the variance of the surprisal, whose thermodynamic meaning is that of heat capacity."

The gates are executed by turning on and off a tunable Josephson coupling between an LC oscillator and a qubit or pair of quits; assuming perfect qubits, we show that the gate errors are exponentially small when the oscillator's impedance sqrtL/C is large compared to hbar/4e^2 ~ 1 kilo-ohm. The protected gates are not computationally universal by themselves, but a scheme for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation can be constructed by combining them with unprotected noisy operations. We validate our analytic arguments with numerical simulations."

1001,1210.3637,2012,4,18,16,Classical simulations of Abelian-group normalizer circuits with intermediate measurements,Juan Bermejo-Vega;Maarten Van den Nest,"Quantum normalizer circuits were recently introduced as generalizations of Clifford circuits [arXiv:1201.4867]: a normalizer circuit over a finite Abelian group $G$ is composed of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) over G, together with gates which compute quadratic functions and automorphisms. In [arXiv:1201.4867] it was shown that every normalizer circuit can be simulated efficiently classically. This result provides a nontrivial example of a family of quantum circuits that cannot yield exponential speed-ups in spite of usage of the QFT, the latter being a central quantum algorithmic primitive. Here we extend the aforementioned result in several ways. Most importantly, we show that normalizer circuits supplemented with intermediate measurements can also be simulated efficiently classically, even when the computation proceeds adaptively. This yields a generalization of the Gottesman-Knill theorem (valid for n-qubit Clifford operations [quant-ph/9705052, quant-ph/9807006] to quantum circuits described by arbitrary finite Abelian groups. Moreover, our simulations are twofold: we present efficient classical algorithms to sample the measurement probability distribution of any adaptive-normalizer computation, as well as to compute the amplitudes of the state vector in every step of it. Finally we develop a generalization of the stabilizer formalism [quant-ph/9705052, quant-ph/9807006] relative to arbitrary finite Abelian groups: for example we characterize how to update stabilizers under generalized Pauli measurements and provide a normal form of the amplitudes of generalized stabilizer states using quadratic functions and subgroup cosets."

Mermin, ""Simple unified form for the major no-hidden-variables theorems,"" Phys. Rev. Lett., 65(27):3373-3376, 1990], but generalized to n binary variables and m constraints. We show that, whenever there is a perfect entangled protocol for such a game, there exists a set of binary observables with commutations and products similar to those exhibited by Mermin. We also show how to derive upper bounds strictly below 1 for the the maximum entangled success probability of some BCS games. These results are partial progress towards a larger project to determine the computational complexity of deciding whether a given instance of a BCS game admits a perfect entangled strategy or not."
1003,1312.7455,2013,2,19,15,On the Parallel Repetition of Multi-Player Games: The No-Signaling Case,Harry Buhrman;Serge Fehr;Christian Schaffner,"We consider the natural extension of two-player nonlocal games to an arbitrary number of players. An important question for such nonlocal games is their behavior under parallel repetition. For two-player nonlocal games, it is known that both the classical and the non-signaling value of any game converges to zero exponentially fast under parallel repetition, given that the game is non-trivial to start with (i.e., has classical/non-signaling value <1). Very recent results show similar behavior for the quantum value of a two-player game under parallel repetition. For nonlocal games with three or more players, very little is known up to present on their behavior under parallel repetition; this is true for the classical, the quantum and the non-signaling value. In this work, we show a parallel repetition theorem for the non-signaling value of a large class of multi-player games, for an arbitrary number of players. Our result applies to all multi-player games for which all possible combinations of questions have positive probability; this class in particular includes all free games, in which the questions to the players are chosen independently. Specifically, we prove that if the original game has a non-signaling value smaller than 1, then the non-signaling value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition is exponentially small in $n$. Our parallel repetition theorem for multi-player games is weaker than the known parallel repetition results for two-player games in that the rate at which the non-signaling value of the game decreases not only depends on the non-signaling value of the original game (and the number of possible responses), but on the complete description of the game. Nevertheless, we feel that our result is a first step towards a better understanding of the parallel repetition of nonlocal games with more than two players."

Adapting a technique of Beigi, we show that such coding requires existence of a set of vectors satisfying orthogonality conditions related to suitably defined graphs $G$ and $H$. Such vectors exist if and only if $\vartheta(\overline{G}) \le \vartheta(\overline{H})$ where $\vartheta$ represents the Lovász number. We also obtain similar inequalities for the related Schrijver $\vartheta^-$ and Szegedy $\vartheta^+$ numbers. These inequalities reproduce several known bounds and also lead to new results. We provide a lower bound on the entanglement assisted cost rate. We show that the entanglement assisted independence number is bounded by the Schrijver number: $\alpha^*(G) \le \vartheta^-(G)$. Therefore, we are able to disprove the conjecture that the one-shot entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity is equal to the integer part of the Lovász number. Beigi introduced a quantity $\beta$ as an upper bound on $\alpha^*$ and posed the question of whether $\beta(G) = \lfloor \vartheta(G) \rfloor$. We answer this in the affirmative and show that a related quantity is equal to $\lceil \vartheta(G) \rceil$. We show that a quantity $\chi_{\textrm{vect}}(G)$ recently introduced in the context of Tsirelson's conjecture is equal to $\lceil \vartheta^+(\overline{G}) \rceil$. In an appendix we investigate multiplicativity properties of Schrijver's and Szegedy's numbers, as well as projective rank."
1005,1209.2426,2012,1,16,15,Magic state distillation with low overhead,Sergey Bravyi;Jeongwan Haah,"We propose a new family of error detecting stabilizer codes with an encoding rate 1/3 that permit a transversal implementation of the pi/8-rotation $T$ on all logical qubits. The new codes are used to construct protocols for distilling high-quality `magic' states $T|+>$ by Clifford group gates and Pauli measurements. The distillation overhead has a poly-logarithmic scaling as a function of the output accuracy, where the degree of the polynomial is $\log_2{3}\approx 1.6$. To construct the desired family of codes, we introduce the notion of a triorthogonal matrix --- a binary matrix in which any pair and any triple of rows have even overlap. Any triorthogonal matrix gives rise to a stabilizer code with a transversal $T$-gate on all logical qubits, possibly augmented by Clifford gates. A powerful numerical method for generating triorthogonal matrices is proposed. Our techniques lead to a two-fold overhead reduction for distilling magic states with output accuracy $10^{-12}$ compared with the best previously known protocol."

Special attention is paid to equivalence with respect to local unitaries and stochastic local operations, invariants along these orbits, momentum map and spectra of partial traces. We discuss absolutely maximally entangled states and their relation to quantum error correction codes. An important case of a large number of parties is also analysed and entanglement in spin systems is briefly reviewed."
1007,1611.09248,2016,9,13,15,An upper bound on quantum capacity of unital channels,Anurag Anshu,"We analyze the quantum capacity of a unital quantum channel, using ideas from the proof of near-optimality of Petz recovery map [Barnum and Knill 2000] and give an upper bound on the quantum capacity in terms of regularized output $2$-norm of the channel. We also show that any code attempting to exceed this upper bound must incur large error in decoding, which can be viewed as a weaker version of the strong converse results for quantum capacity. As an application, we find nearly matching upper and lower bounds (up to an additive constant) on the quantum capacity of quantum expander channels. Using these techniques, we further conclude that the `mixture of random unitaries' channels arising in the construction of quantum expanders in [Hastings 2007] show a trend in multiplicativity of output $2$-norm similar to that exhibited in [Montanaro 2013] for output $\infty$-norm of random quantum channels."
1008,1610.09970,2016,10,29,15,Gaussian states minimize the output entropy of one-mode quantum Gaussian channels,Giacomo De Palma;Dario Trevisan;Vittorio Giovannetti,We prove that Gaussian thermal input states minimize the output von Neumann entropy of any one-mode phase-covariant quantum Gaussian channel among all the input states with a given entropy. The starting point of the proof is the recent result stating that Gaussian thermal input states saturate the p->q norms of one-mode quantum-limited Gaussian channels. Quantum Gaussian channels model in the quantum regime the attenuation and the noise that affect any electromagnetic signal. This result is crucial to prove the converse theorems for both the triple trade-off region and the capacity region for broadcast communication of the Gaussian quantum-limited amplifier.
1009,1610.05614,2016,9,12,15,Quantum Authentication and Encryption with Key Recycling,Serge Fehr;Louis Salvail,"We propose an information-theoretically secure encryption scheme for classical messages with quantum ciphertexts that offers detection of eavesdropping attacks, and re-usability of the key in case no eavesdropping took place: the entire key can be securely re-used for encrypting new messages as long as no attack is detected. This is known to be impossible for fully classical schemes, where there is no way to detect plain eavesdropping attacks. This particular application of quantum techniques to cryptography was originally proposed by Bennett, Brassard and Breidbart in 1982, even before proposing quantum-key-distribution, and a simple candidate scheme was suggested but no rigorous security analysis was given. The idea was picked up again in 2005, when Damgard, Pedersen and Salvail suggested a new scheme for the same task, but now with a rigorous security analysis. However, their scheme is much more demanding in terms of quantum capabilities: it requires the users to have a quantum computer. In contrast, and like the original scheme by Bennett et al., our new scheme merely requires to prepare and measure single BB84 qubits. As such, we not only show a provably-secure scheme that is within reach of current technology, but we also confirm Bennett et al.'s original intuition that a scheme in the spirit of their original construction - though slightly more involved - is indeed secure."
1010,1610.04214,2016,12,26,15,Quantum non-malleability and authentication,Gorjan Alagic;Christian Majenz,"In the setting of encryption schemes, non-malleability is a highly desirable property: it ensures that no adversary can meaningfully manipulate the plaintext by acting on the ciphertext. In this work, we give a new definition of non-malleability for encryption of quantum data, improving on the previous definition of Ambainis Bouda and Winter. Our definition is expressed in terms of entropic quantities, considers stronger adversaries, and does not assume secrecy. We prove that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy, in stark contrast to the classical setting where the two properties are independent. In the case of non-unitary schemes, we also provide a separation example which demonstrates a weakness in the definition of Ambainis et al. In the case of unitary schemes, we establish that the two definitions are equivalent, by showing that our definition is equivalent to the notion of a unitary two-design. We also give new results regarding the closely-related task of quantum authentication. We show that the strong notion of ""total authentication"" recently proposed by Garg, Yuen and Zhandry can be satisfied with two-designs. This is a significant improvement over their construction, which required eight-designs. We also show that, under a mild adaptation of the rejection procedure, both total authentication and our notion of non-malleability yield quantum authentication as defined by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail."
1011,1609.09160,2016,12,23,15,The gap of Fredkin quantum spin chain is polynomially small,Ramis Movassagh,"We prove a new result on the spectral gap and mixing time of a Markov chain with Glauber dynamics on the space of Dyck paths (i.e., Catalan paths) and their generalization, which we call colored Dyck paths. The proof uses the comparison theorem of Diaconis and Saloff-Coste and our previous results. Denoting by $2n$ the number of spins, we prove that the gap of the Fredkin spin chain Hamiltonian is $\Theta(n^{-c})$ with $c\ge2$. Our result on the spectral gap of the Markov chain above is used to prove a lower bound of $O(n^{-13/2})$ on the energy gap of the Fredkin quantum spin chain. We prove an upper bound of $O(n^{-2})$ using the universality of Brownian motion and convergence of Dyck random walks to Brownian excursions. Lastly, the 'unbalanced' ground state energies are proved to be polynomially small in $n$ by mapping the Hamiltonian to an effective hopping Hamiltonian with next nearest neighbor interactions and analytically solving its ground state."

Namely, we examine the concatenation of the 7-qubit Steane code with the 15-qubit Reed-Muller code, which allows for the construction of the 49 and 105-qubit codes that do not require the need for magic state distillation for universality. We compute a lower bound for the adversarial noise threshold of the 105-qubit code and find it to be $8.33\times 10^{-6}.$ We obtain a depolarizing noise threshold for the 49-qubit code of $9.69\times 10^{-4}$ which is competitive with the 105-qubit threshold result of $1.28\times 10^{-3}$. We then provide lower bounds on the resource requirements of the 49 and 105-qubit codes and compare them with the surface code implementation of a logical $T$ gate using magic state distillation. For the sampled input error rates and noise model, we find that the surface code achieves a smaller overhead compared to our concatenated schemes."

The answer to this question is known as Sinkhorn's theorem. It has been proved with a wide variety of methods, each presenting a variety of possible generalisations. Recently, generalisations such as to positive maps between matrix algebras have become more and more interesting for applications. This text gives a review of over 70 years of matrix scaling. The focus lies on the mathematical landscape surrounding the problem and its solution as well as the generalisation to positive maps and contains hardly any nontrivial unpublished results."

Recently, there has been significant theoretical effort by mainly focusing on the distribution of bipartite entanglement via a simple quantum network composed only of bipartite quantum channels. There are, however, a number of quantum information processing protocols based on multipartite entanglement, rather than bipartite one, which should be served more naturally by a quantum broadcast network, rather than such a simple network. In this work, we present a general framework for deriving upper bounds on the rates at which GHZ states or multipartite private states can be distributed among a number of different parties over any quantum broadcast network. We also discuss how lower bounds can be obtained by combining generalisation of an aggregated quantum repeater protocol with graph theoretic concepts."
1015,1608.06940,2016,10,14,15,"Operational General Relativity: Possibilistic, Probabilistic, and Quantum",Lucien Hardy,"In this paper we develop an operational formulation of General Relativity similar in spirit to existing operational formulations of Quantum Theory. To do this we introduce an operational space (or op-space) built out of scalar fields. A point in op-space corresponds to some nominated set of scalar fields taking some given values in coincidence. We assert that op-space is the space in which we observe the world. We introduce also a notion of agency (this corresponds to the ability to set knob settings just like in Operational Quantum Theory). The effects of agents' actions should only be felt to the future so we introduce also a time direction field. Agency and time direction can be understood as effective notions. We show how to formulate General Relativity as a possibilistic theory and as a probabilistic theory. In the possibilistic case we provide a compositional framework for calculating whether some operationally described situation is possible or not. In the probabilistic version we introduce probabilities and provide a compositional framework for calculating the probability of some operationally described situation. Finally we look at the quantum case. We review the operator tensor formulation of Quantum Theory and use it to set up an approach to Quantum Field Theory that is both operational and compositional. Then we consider strategies for solving the problem of Quantum Gravity. By referring only to operational quantities we are able to provide formulations for the possibilistic, probabilistic, and (the nascent) quantum cases that are manifestly invariant under diffeomorphisms."
1016,1607.07516,2016,9,30,15,Quantum Advantage on Information Leakage for Equality,Juan Miguel Arrazola;Dave Touchette,"We prove a lower bound on the information leakage of any classical protocol computing the equality function in the simultaneous message passing (SMP) model. Our bound is valid in the finite length regime and is strong enough to demonstrate a quantum advantage in terms of information leakage for practical quantum protocols. We prove our bound by obtaining an improved finite size version of the communication bound due to Babai and Kimmel, relating randomized communication to deterministic communication in the SMP model. We then relate information leakage to randomized communication through a series of reductions. We first provide alternative characterizations for information leakage, allowing us to link it to average length communication while allowing for shared randomness (pairwise, with the referee). A Markov inequality links this with bounded length communication, and a Newman type argument allows us to go from shared to private randomness. The only reduction in which we incur more than a logarithmic additive factor is in the Markov inequality; in particular, our compression method is essentially tight for the SMP model with average length communication."

Here we formulate the framework of quantum relative Lorenz curves, and show how it is able to unify majorization, thermomajorization, and their noncommutative analogues. In doing so, we define the family of Hilbert $\alpha$-divergences and show how it relates with other divergences used in quantum information theory. We then apply these tools to the problem of deciding the existence of a suitable transformation from an initial pair of quantum states to a final one, focusing in particular on applications to the resource theory of athermality, a precursor of quantum thermodynamics."

Here, we study a new class of simulators for quantum message authentication schemes, and show how they are applied in the context of two codes: the Clifford and the trap code. Our results show for the first time that these codes admit an efficient simulation (assuming that the adversary is efficient). Such efficient simulation is typically crucial in order to establish a composable notion of security."

We say a Bell inequality is normalized if its absolute value does not exceed 1 for any classical (i.e. local) distribution. Upper and (almost) tight lower bounds have been given in terms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the dimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized Bell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell inequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1 for any local distribution, including those that can abort. Both these families of Bell inequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We show how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum communication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication is proven using these lower bounds. This leads to inefficiency-resistant violations that can be exponential in the size of the inputs. Finally, we study resistance to noise and inefficiency for these Bell inequalities."
1020,1606.05626,2016,8,26,15,The complexity of estimating local physical quantities,Sevag Gharibian;Justin Yirka,"An important task in quantum physics is the estimation of local quantities for ground states of local Hamiltonians. Recently, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] defined the complexity class P^QMA[log], and motivated its study by showing that the physical task of estimating the expectation value of a local observable against the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is P^QMA[log]-complete. In this paper, we continue the study of P^QMA[log], obtaining the following results: (1) The P^QMA[log]-completeness result of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] above requires O(log(n))-local Hamiltonians and O(log(n))-local observables. Whether this could be improved to the more physically appealing O(1)-local setting was left as an open question. We resolve this question positively by showing that simulating even a single qubit measurement on ground states of 5-local Hamiltonians is P^QMA[log]-complete. (2) We formalize the complexity theoretic study of estimating two-point correlation functions against ground states, and show that this task is P^QMA[log]-complete. (3) P^QMA[log] is thought of as ""slightly harder"" than QMA. We give a formal justification of this intuition by exploiting the technique of hierarchical voting of [Beigel, Hemachandra, and Wechsung, SCT 1989] to show P^QMA[log] is in PP. This improves the known containment that QMA is in PP [Kitaev, Watrous, STOC 2000]. (4) A central theme of this work is the subtlety involved in the study of oracle classes in which the oracle solves a promise problem. In this vein, we identify a flaw in [Ambainis, CCC 2014] regarding a P^UQMA[log]-hardness proof for estimating spectral gaps of local Hamiltonians. By introducing a ""query validation"" technique, we build on [Ambainis, CCC 2014] to obtain P^UQMA[log]-hardness for estimating spectral gaps under polynomial-time Turing reductions."

In a quantum world, understanding causal relations is equally important, but the set of possibilities is far richer. The two basic ways in which a pair of time-ordered quantum systems may be causally related are by a cause-effect mechanism or by a common cause acting on both. Here, we show that it is possible to have a coherent mixture of these two possibilities. We realize such a nonclassical causal relation in a quantum optics experiment and derive a set of criteria for witnessing the coherence based on a quantum version of Berkson's paradox. The interplay of causality and quantum theory lies at the heart of challenging foundational puzzles, such as Bell's theorem and the search for quantum gravity, but could also provide a resource for novel quantum technologies."

Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) stabilizer states are of particular importance in their application to fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). However, how to fault-tolerantly prepare arbitrary CSS stabilizer states for general CSS stabilizer codes is still unknown, and their preparation can be highly costly in computational resources. In this paper, we show how to prepare a large class of CSS stabilizer states useful for FTQC. We propose distillation protocols using syndrome encoding by classical codes or quantum CSS codes. Along the same lines, we show that classical coding techniques can reduce the ancilla consumption in Steane syndrome extraction by using additional transversal controlled-NOT gates and classical computing power. In the scenario of a fixed ancilla consumption rate, we can increase the frequency of quantum error correction and effectively lower the error rate."
1023,1604.08217,2016,7,12,15,"Entanglement Conservation, ER=EPR, and a New Classical Area Theorem for Wormholes",Grant Remmen;Ning Bao;Jason Pollack,"We consider the question of entanglement conservation in the context of the ER=EPR correspondence equating quantum entanglement with wormholes. In quantum mechanics, the entanglement between a system and its complement is conserved under unitary operations that act independently on each; ER=EPR suggests that an analogous statement should hold for wormholes. We accordingly prove a new area theorem in general relativity: for a collection of dynamical wormholes and black holes in a spacetime satisfying the null curvature condition, the maximin area for a subset of the horizons (giving the largest area attained by the minimal cross section of the multi-wormhole throat separating the subset from its complement) is invariant under classical time evolution along the outermost apparent horizons. The evolution can be completely general, including horizon mergers and the addition of classical matter satisfying the null energy condition. This theorem is the gravitational dual of entanglement conservation and thus constitutes an explicit characterization of the ER=EPR duality in the classical limit."
1024,1604.06974,2016,7,1,15,Quasiprobability representations of quantum mechanics with minimal negativity,Huangjun Zhu,"Quasiprobability representations, such as the Wigner function, play an important role in various research areas. The inevitable appearance of negativity in such representations is often regarded as a signature of nonclassicality, which has profound implications for quantum computation. However, little is known about the minimal negativity that is necessary in general quasiprobability representations. Here we focus on a natural class of quasiprobability representations that is distinguished by simplicity and economy. We introduce three measures of negativity concerning the representations of quantum states, unitary transformations, and quantum channels, respectively. Quite surprisingly, all three measures lead to the same representations with minimal negativity, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the elusive symmetric informationally complete measurements. In addition, most representations with minimal negativity are automatically covariant with respect to the Heisenberg-Weyl groups. Furthermore, our study reveals an interesting tradeoff between negativity and symmetry in quasiprobability representations."

For certain K with sufficiently small discriminant we produce explicit unit generators for specific ray class fields of K using a numerical method that arose in the study of complete sets of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$ (known in quantum information as symmetric informationally complete measurements or SICs). The construction in low dimensions suggests a general recipe for producing unit generators in infinite towers of ray class fields above arbitrary K and we summarise this in a conjecture. Such explicit generators are notoriously difficult to find, so this recipe may be of some interest. In a forthcoming paper we shall publish promising results of numerical comparisons between the logarithms of these canonical units and the values of L-functions associated to the extensions, following the programme laid out in the Stark Conjectures."

When we consider light as a quantum mechanical object, new ways of information processing become possible. In this review I give an overview how quantum information processing can be implemented with single photons, and what hurdles still need to be overcome to implement the various applications in practice. I will place special emphasis on the quantum mechanical properties of light that make it different from classical light, and how these properties relate to quantum information processing tasks."

These correlation functions are of theoretical interest for diagnosing the scrambling of quantum information in black holes and strongly interacting quantum systems generally. Measuring them requires an echo-type sequence in which the sign of a many-body Hamiltonian is reversed. We detail an implementation employing cold atoms and cavity quantum electrodynamics to realize the chaotic kicked top model, and we analyze effects of dissipation to verify its feasibility with current technology. Finally, we propose in broad strokes a number of other experimental platforms where similar out-of-time-order correlation functions can be measured."

1030,1601.07256,2016,3,17,15,Discrimination of two-qubit unitaries via local operations and classical communication,Joonwoo Bae,"Distinguishability is a fundamental and operational task generally connected to information applications. In quantum information theory, from the postulates of quantum mechanics it often has an intrinsic limitation, which then dictates and also characterises capabilities of related information tasks. In this work, we consider discrimination between bipartite two-qubit unitary transformations by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and its relations to entangling capabilities of given unitaries. We show that a pair of entangling unitaries which do not contain local parts, if they are perfectly distinguishable by global operations, can also be perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. There also exist non-entangling unitaries, e.g. local unitaries, that are perfectly discriminated by global operations but not by LOCC. The results show that capabilities of LOCC are strictly restricted than global operations in distinguishing bipartite unitaries for a finite number of repetitions, contrast to discrimination of a pair of bipartite states and also to asymptotic discrimination of unitaries."
1031,1601.06035,2016,2,22,15,Recommender systems inspired by the structure of quantum theory,Cyril J Stark,"Physicists use quantum models to describe the behavior of physical systems. Quantum models owe their success to their interpretability, to their relation to probabilistic models (quantization of classical models) and to their high predictive power. Beyond physics, these properties are valuable in general data science. This motivates the use of quantum models to analyze general nonphysical datasets. Here we provide both empirical and theoretical insights into the application of quantum models in data science. In the theoretical part of this paper, we firstly show that quantum models can be exponentially more efficient than probabilistic models because there exist datasets that admit low-dimensional quantum models and only exponentially high-dimensional probabilistic models. Secondly, we explain in what sense quantum models realize a useful relaxation of compressed probabilistic models. Thirdly, we show that sparse datasets admit low-dimensional quantum models and finally, we introduce a method to compute hierarchical orderings of properties of users (e.g., personality traits) and items (e.g., genres of movies). In the empirical part of the paper, we evaluate quantum models in item recommendation and observe that the predictive power of quantum-inspired recommender systems can compete with state-of-the-art recommender systems like SVD++ and PureSVD. Furthermore, we make use of the interpretability of quantum models by computing hierarchical orderings of properties of users and items. This work establishes a connection between data science (item recommendation), information theory (communication complexity), mathematical programming (positive semidefinite factorizations) and physics (quantum models)."
1032,1601.01302,2016,1,29,15,Fully quantum fluctuation theorems,Johan Aberg,"Systems that are driven out of thermal equilibrium typically dissipate random quantities of energy on microscopic scales. Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the distribution of these random work costs with the corresponding distribution for the reverse process. By an analysis that explicitly incorporates the energy reservoir that donates the energy, and the control system that implements the dynamic, we here obtain a quantum generalization of Crooks theorem that not only includes the energy changes on the reservoir, but the full description of its evolution, including coherences. This approach moreover opens up for generalizations of the concept of fluctuation relations. Here we introduce `conditional' fluctuation relations that are applicable to non-equilibrium systems, as well as approximate fluctuation relations that allow for the analysis of autonomous evolution generated by global time-independent Hamiltonians."
1033,1601.01207,2016,1,28,15,"Approximate reversibility in the context of entropy gain, information gain, and complete positivity",Francesco Buscemi;Siddhartha Das;Mark M Wilde,"There are several inequalities in physics which limit how well we can process physical systems to achieve some intended goal, including the second law of thermodynamics, entropy bounds in quantum information theory, and the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Recent results provide physically meaningful enhancements of these limiting statements, determining how well one can attempt to reverse an irreversible process. In this paper, we apply and extend these results to give strong enhancements to several entropy inequalities, having to do with entropy gain, information gain, entropic disturbance, and complete positivity of open quantum systems dynamics. Our first result is a remainder term for the entropy gain of a quantum channel. This result implies that a small increase in entropy under the action of a subunital channel is a witness to the fact that the channel's adjoint can be used as a recovery map to undo the action of the original channel. Our second result regards the information gain of a quantum measurement, both without and with quantum side information. We find here that a small information gain implies that it is possible to undo the action of the original measurement if it is efficient. The result also has operational ramifications for the information-theoretic tasks known as measurement compression without and with quantum side information. Our third result shows that the loss of Holevo information caused by the action of a noisy channel on an input ensemble of quantum states is small if and only if the noise can be approximately corrected on average. We finally establish that the reduced dynamics of a system-environment interaction are approximately completely positive and trace-preserving if and only if the data processing inequality holds approximately."

The number of terms in the product depends on the structure factors. When the generators have large norm with respect to the dimension of the Lie algebra, or when the norm of the effective operator resulting from nested commutators is less than the product of the norms, the number of terms in the product is significantly less than that obtained from well-known results. We apply our results to construct product formulas useful for the quantum simulation of some continuous-variable and bosonic physical systems, including systems whose potential is not quadratic. For many of these systems, we show that the number of terms in the product can be sublinear or subpolynomial in the dimension of the relevant local Hilbert spaces, where such a dimension is usually determined by an energy scale of the problem. Our results emphasize the power of quantum computers for the simulation of various quantum systems."

Here, we demonstrate how finite range tunneling can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables, this results in a time-to-99%-success-probability that is $\sim 10^8$ times faster than SA running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA: D-Wave 2X again runs up to $\sim 10^8$ times faster than an optimized implementation of QMC on a single core. We note that there exist heuristic classical algorithms that can solve most instances of Chimera structured problems in a timescale comparable to the D-Wave 2X. However, we believe that such solvers will become ineffective for the next generation of annealers currently being designed. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number partitioning problem, we find numerically that QMC, as well as other algorithms designed to simulate QA, scale better than SA. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers."

In this work we show that even random observables exhibit near-maximal violations of the CHSH-Bell inequality. To do this, we introduce so-called free observables which are freely independent in some quantum probability space. We also study the fine-grained uncertainty of a sequence of free or random observables, and use this to construct a steering inequality with large violation."

We introduce a ``constraint graph"" associated to such a game, with the constraints defining the linear game represented by an edge-coloring of the graph. We use the graph-theoretic characterization to relate the task of finding equivalent games to the notion of signed graphs and switching equivalence from graph theory. We relate the problem of computing the classical value of single-party anti-correlation XOR games to finding the edge bipartization number of a graph, which is known to be MaxSNP hard, and connect the computation of the classical value of more general XOR-d games to the identification of specific cycles in the graph. We construct an orthogonality graph of the game from the constraint graph and study its Lovász theta number as a general upper bound on the quantum value even in the case of single-party contextual XOR-d games. Linear games possess appealing properties for use in device-independent applications such as randomness of the local correlated outcomes in the optimal quantum strategy. We study the possibility of obtaining quantum algebraic violation of these games, and show that no finite linear game possesses the property of pseudo-telepathy leaving the frequently used chained Bell inequalities as the natural candidates for such applications. We also show this lack of pseudo-telepathy for multi-party XOR-type inequalities involving two-body correlation functions."

Likewise quantum walks have shown much potential as a frame- work for developing new quantum algorithms. In this paper, we present explicit efficient quantum circuits for implementing continuous-time quantum walks on the circulant class of graphs. These circuits allow us to sample from the output probability distributions of quantum walks on circulant graphs efficiently. We also show that solving the same sampling problem for arbitrary circulant quantum circuits is intractable for a classical computer, assuming conjectures from computational complexity theory. This is a new link between continuous-time quantum walks and computational complexity theory and it indicates a family of tasks which could ultimately demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computers. As a proof of principle we have experimentally implemented the proposed quantum circuit on an example circulant graph using a two-qubit photonics quantum processor."

The main theoretical problem in QKD is to calculate the secret key rate for a given protocol. Analytical formulas are known for protocols with symmetries, since symmetry simplifies the analysis. However, experimental imperfections break symmetries, hence the effect of imperfections on key rates is difficult to estimate. Furthermore, it is an interesting question whether (intentionally) asymmetric protocols could outperform symmetric ones. Here, we develop a robust numerical approach for calculating the key rate for arbitrary discrete-variable QKD protocols. Ultimately this will allow researchers to study ""unstructured"" protocols, that is, those that lack symmetry. Our approach relies on transforming the key rate calculation to the dual optimization problem, which dramatically reduces the number of parameters and hence the calculation time. We illustrate our method by investigating some unstructured protocols for which the key rate was previously unknown."

The types of quantum channels we consider are those of interest in quantum information theory: unitary conjugations, constant channels, unital channels, mixed unitary channels, PPT channels, and entanglement breaking channels. For some of the classes of bipartite unitary operators corresponding to the above types of channels, we provide explicit characterizations, necessary and/or sufficient conditions for membership, and we compute the dimension of the corresponding algebraic variety. Inclusions between these classes are considered, and we show that for small dimensions, many of these sets are identical."

One physicist answers: ""It means that non-locality is an established fact"". Another says: ""There is no non-locality; the message is that measurement outcomes are irreducibly random"". A third one says: ""It cannot be answered simply on purely physical grounds, the answer requires an act of metaphysical judgement"". Puzzled by the answers, the journalist keeps asking questions about quantum theory: ""What is teleported in quantum teleportation?"" ""How does a quantum computer really work?"" Shockingly, for each of these questions, the journalist obtains a variety of answers which, in many cases, are mutually exclusive. At the end of the day, the journalist asks: ""How do you plan to make progress if, after 90 years of quantum theory, you still don't know what it means? How can you possibly identify the physical principles of quantum theory or expand quantum theory into gravity if you don't agree on what quantum theory is about?"" Here we argue that it is becoming urgent to solve this too long lasting problem. For that, we point out that the interpretations of quantum theory are, essentially, of two types and that these two types are so radically different that there must be experiments that, when analyzed outside the framework of quantum theory, lead to different empirically testable predictions. Arguably, even if these experiments do not end the discussion, they will add new elements to the list of strange properties that some interpretations must have, therefore they will indirectly support those interpretations that do not need to have all these strange properties."

Physical theories, however, are not generally considered valid for all mathematically allowed measurements. For instance, quantum field theories are not meant to be correct or even consistent at arbitrarily small lengthscales. A general way of limiting such an optimisation to certain observables is to first coarse-grain the states by a quantum channel. We show how to calculate contractive quantum information metrics on coarse-grained equilibrium states of free bosonic systems (Gaussian states), in directions generated by arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian. As an example, we study the Klein-Gordon field. If the phase-space resolution is coarse compared to h-bar, the various metrics become equal and the calculations simplify. In that context, we compute the scale dependence of the distinguishability of the quartic interaction."

A complete characterization for universal resource states is still missing. It has been shown that symmetry-protected topological order in one dimension can be exploited for the protection of certain quantum gates in measurement-based quantum computation. In this paper we show that the two-dimensional plaquette states on arbitrary lattices exhibit nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order in terms of symmetry fractionalization and that they are universal resource states for quantum computation. Our results of the nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order on arbitrary 2D lattices are based on an extension of the recent construction by Chen, Gu, Liu and Wen [Phys. Rev.

This mapping is efficient whenever the boson bunching probability is small, and errors can be efficiently postselected. This mapping opens the door to boson sampling with quantum simulators or general purpose quantum computers, and highlights the complexity of time-evolution with critical spin models, even for very short times."

Using quantum entanglement, one can reduce the necessary assumptions that the parties have to make about their devices, giving rise to device-independent QKD (DIQKD). However, in all existing protocols to date the parties need to have an initial (at least partially) random seed as a resource. In this work, we show that this requirement can be dropped. Using recent advances in the fields of randomness amplification and randomness expansion, we demonstrate that it is sufficient for the message the parties want to communicate to be (partially) unknown to the adversaries -- an assumption without which any type of cryptography would be pointless to begin with. One party can use her secret message to locally generate a secret sequence of bits, which can then be openly used by herself and the other party in a DIQKD protocol. Hence, our work reduces the requirements needed to perform secure DIQKD and establish safe communication."

We introduce a generalization which we call conical t-designs. They include arbitrary rank symmetric informationally complete measurements (SIMs) and full sets of arbitrary rank mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs). They are deeply implicated in the description of entanglement (as we show in a subsequent paper). Viewed in one way a conical 2-design is a symmetric decomposition of a separable Werner state (up to a normalization factor). Viewed in another way it is a certain kind of polytope in the Bloch body. In the Bloch body picture SIMs and full sets of MUMs form highly symmetric polytopes (a single regular simplex in the one case; the convex hull of a set of orthogonal regular simplices in the other). We give the necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary polytope to be what we call a homogeneous conical 2-design. This suggests a way to search for new kinds of projective 2-design."
1049,1507.04263,2015,8,6,15,Efficient implementation of Quantum circuits with limited qubit interactions,Stephen Brierley,The quantum circuit model allows gates between any pair of qubits yet physical instantiations allow only limited interactions. We address this problem by providing an interaction graph together with an efficient method for compiling quantum circuits so that gates are applied only locally. The graph requires each qubit to interact with 4 other qubits and yet the time-overhead for implementing any n-qubit quantum circuit is 6 log n. Building a network of quantum computing nodes according to this graph enables the network to emulate a single monolithic device with minimal overhead.
1050,1506.07975,2015,7,22,15,Operational Resource Theory of Coherence,Andreas Winter;Dong Yang,"We establish an operational theory of coherence (or of superposition) in quantum systems, by focusing on the optimal rate of performance of certain tasks. Namely, we introduce the two basic concepts - ""coherence distillation"" and ""coherence cost"" in the processing quantum states under so-called incoherent operations [Baumgratz/Cramer/Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113:140401 (2014)]. We then show that in the asymptotic limit of many copies of a state, both are given by simple single-letter formulas: the distillable coherence is given by the relative entropy of coherence (in other words, we give the relative entropy of coherence its operational interpretation), and the coherence cost by the coherence of formation, which is an optimization over convex decompositions of the state. An immediate corollary is that there exists no bound coherent state in the sense that one would need to consume coherence to create the state but no coherence could be distilled from it. Further we demonstrate that the coherence theory is generically an irreversible theory by a simple criterion that completely characterizes all reversible states."
1051,1506.07875,2015,7,21,15,The extraction of work from quantum coherence,Kamil Korzekwa;Matteo Lostaglio;Jonathan Oppenheim;David Jennings,"The interplay between quantum-mechanical properties, such as coherence, and classical notions, such as energy, is a subtle topic at the forefront of quantum thermodynamics. The traditional Carnot argument limits the conversion of heat to work; here we critically assess the problem of converting coherence to work. Through a careful account of all resources involved in the thermodynamic transformations within a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, we show that there exist thermal machines extracting work from coherence arbitrarily well. Such machines only need to act on individual copies of a state and can be reused. On the other hand, we show that for any thermal machine with finite resources not all the coherence of a state can be extracted as work. However, even bounded thermal machines can be reused infinitely many times in the process of work extraction from coherence."
1052,1506.05766,2015,7,16,15,Multiparticle entanglement as an emergent phenomenon,Nikolai Miklin;Tobias Moroder;Otfried Gühne,"The question whether global entanglement of a multiparticle quantum system can be inferred from local properties is of great relevance for the theory of quantum correlations as well as for experimental implementations. We present a method to systematically find quantum states, for which the two- or three-body marginals do not contain any entanglement, nevertheless, the knowledge of these reduced states is sufficient to prove genuine multiparticle entanglement of the global state. With this, we show that the emergence of global entanglement from separable local quantum states occurs frequently and for an arbitrary number of particles. We discuss various extensions of the phenomenon and present examples where global entanglement can be proven from marginals, even if entanglement cannot be localized in the marginals with measurements on the other parties."
1053,1506.04014,2015,6,29,15,The complexity of antiferromagnetic interactions and 2D lattices,Stephen Piddock;Ashley Montanaro,"Estimation of the minimum eigenvalue of a quantum Hamiltonian can be formalised as the Local Hamiltonian problem. We study the natural special case of the Local Hamiltonian problem where the same 2-local interaction, with differing weights, is applied across each pair of qubits. First we consider antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic interactions, where the weights of the terms in the Hamiltonian are restricted to all be of the same sign. We show that for symmetric 2-local interactions with no 1-local part, the problem is either QMA-complete or in StoqMA. In particular the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and antiferromagnetic XY interactions are shown to be QMA-complete. We also prove StoqMA-completeness of the antiferromagnetic transverse field Ising model. Second, we study the Local Hamiltonian problem under the restriction that the interaction terms can only be chosen to lie on a particular graph. We prove that nearly all of the QMA-complete 2-local interactions remain QMA-complete when restricted to a 2D square lattice. Finally we consider both restrictions at the same time and discover that, with the exception of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction, all of the interactions which are QMA-complete with positive coefficients remain QMA-complete when restricted to a 2D triangular lattice."

By exploiting the physical resource of entanglement, quantum teleportation serves as a key primitive in a variety of quantum information tasks and represents an important building block for quantum technologies, with a pivotal role in the continuing progress of quantum communication, quantum computing and quantum networks. Here we review the basic theoretical ideas behind quantum teleportation and its variant protocols. We focus on the main experiments, together with the technical advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of the various technologies, from photonic qubits and optical modes to atomic ensembles, trapped atoms, and solid-state systems. Analysing the current state-of-the-art, we finish by discussing open issues, challenges and potential future implementations."
1055,1505.00461,2015,6,19,15,Entanglement-Saving Channels,Ludovico Lami;Vittorio Giovannetti,"The set of Entanglement Saving (ES) quantum channels is introduced and characterized. These are completely positive, trace preserving transformations which when acting locally on a bipartite quantum system initially prepared into a maximally entangled configuration, preserve its entanglement even when applied an arbitrary number of times. In other words, a quantum channel $\psi$ is said to be ES if its powers $\psi^n$ are not entanglement-breaking for all integers $n$. We also characterize the properties of the Asymptotic Entanglement Saving (AES) maps. These form a proper subset of the ES channels that is constituted by those maps which, not only preserve entanglement for all finite $n$, but which also sustain an explicitly not null level of entanglement in the asymptotic limit~$n\rightarrow \infty$. Structure theorems are provided for ES and for AES maps which yield an almost complete characterization of the former and a full characterization of the latter."

We provide complete symmetry criteria deciding whether some effective target interaction(s) can be simulated by a set of given interactions. Symmetries lead to a better understanding of simulation and permit a reasoning beyond the limitations of the usual explicit Lie closure. Conserved quantities induced by symmetries pave the way to a resource theory for simulability. On a general level, one can now decide equality for any pair of compact Lie algebras just given by their generators without determining the algebras explicitly. Several physical examples are illustrated, including entanglement invariants, the relation to unitary gate membership problems, as well as the central-spin model."

We analyse the extent to which this bound can be generalised. Ambainis et al. [arXiv:1012.2112] and Lee et al. [arXiv:1011.3020] generalised this bound to the state generation and state conversion problems, respectively. Using the ideas by Lee et al., we get even further generalisations of the bound. We obtain a version of the bound for general input oracles, which are just arbitrary unitaries. We also generalise the bound to the problem of implementing arbitrary unitary transformations. Similarly to the bound by Lee et al., our bound is a lower bound for exact transformation and an upper bound for approximate transformation. This version of the bound possesses the tight composition property. Using this construction, we also obtain lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of functions and relations with general input oracles."
1058,1504.06313,2015,5,5,15,Randomness amplification against no-signaling adversaries using two devices,Ravishankar Ramanathan;Fernando G S L Brandão;Karol Horodecki;Michał Horodecki;Paweł Horodecki;Hanna Wojewódka,"Recently, a physically realistic protocol amplifying the randomness of Santha-Vazirani sources producing cryptographically secure random bits was proposed; however for reasons of practical relevance, the crucial question remained open whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions necessary for the task. Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness amplification using only two no-signaling components and in a situation where the violation of a Bell inequality only guarantees that some outcomes of the device for specific inputs exhibit randomness? Here, we solve this question and present a device-independent protocol for randomness amplification of Santha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of two non-signaling components. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source that is not fully deterministic into a fully random source while tolerating a constant noise rate and prove the composable security of the protocol against general no-signaling adversaries. Our main innovation is the proof that even the partial randomness certified by the two-party Bell test (a single input-output pair ($\textbf{u}^*, \textbf{x}^*$) for which the conditional probability $P(\textbf{x}^* | \textbf{u}^*)$ is bounded away from $1$ for all no-signaling strategies that optimally violate the Bell inequality) can be used for amplification. We introduce the methodology of a partial tomographic procedure on the empirical statistics obtained in the Bell test that ensures that the outputs constitute a linear min-entropy source of randomness. As a technical novelty that may be of independent interest, we prove that the Santha-Vazirani source satisfies an exponential concentration property given by a recently discovered generalized Chernoff bound."
1059,1504.04575,2015,4,30,15,Witnessing entanglement by proxy,Stefan Bäuml;Dagmar Bruß;Marcus Huber;Hermann Kampermann;Andreas Winter,"Entanglement is a ubiquitous feature of low temperature systems and believed to be highly relevant for the dynamics of condensed matter properties and quantum computation even at higher temperatures. The experimental certification of this paradigmatic quantum effect in macroscopic high temperature systems is constrained by the limited access to the quantum state of the system. In this paper we show how macroscopic observables beyond the energy of the system can be exploited as proxy witnesses for entanglement detection. Using linear and semi-definite relaxations we show that all previous approaches to this problem can be outperformed by our proxies, i.e. entanglement can be certified at higher temperatures without access to any local observable. For an efficient computation of proxy witnesses one can resort to a generalized grand canonical ensemble, enabling entanglement certification even in complex systems with macroscopic particle numbers."
1060,1504.04215,2015,4,28,15,Quantum Time,Vittorio Giovannetti;Seth Lloyd;Lorenzo Maccone,"We give a consistent quantum description of time, based on Page and Wootters' conditional probabilities mechanism, that overcomes the criticisms that were raised against similar previous proposals. In particular we show how the model allows to reproduce the correct statistics of sequential measurements performed on a system at different times."
1061,1504.03773,2015,4,24,15,Permutation Symmetry Determines the Discrete Wigner Function,Huangjun Zhu,"The Wigner function provides a useful quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics, with applications in various branches of physics. Many nice properties of the Wigner function are intimately connected with the high symmetry of the underlying operator basis composed of phase point operators: any pair of phase point operators can be transformed to any other pair by a unitary symmetry transformation. We prove that, in the discrete scenario, this permutation symmetry is equivalent to the symmetry group being a unitary 2-design. Such a highly symmetric representation can only appear in odd prime power dimensions besides dimensions 2 and 8. It suffices to single out a unique discrete Wigner function among all possible quasiprobability representations. In the course of our study, we show that this discrete Wigner function is uniquely determined by Clifford covariance, while no Wigner function is Clifford covariant in any even prime power dimension."
1062,1503.08121,2015,4,20,15,Quantum simulation of quantum field theory using continuous variables,Kevin Marshall;Raphael Pooser;George Siopsis;Christian Weedbrook,"Much progress has been made in the field of quantum computing using continuous variables over the last couple of years. This includes the generation of extremely large entangled cluster states (10,000 modes, in fact) as well as a fault tolerant architecture. This has led to the point that continuous-variable quantum computing can indeed be thought of as a viable alternative for universal quantum computing. With that in mind, we present a new algorithm for continuous-variable quantum computers which gives an exponential speedup over the best known classical methods. Specifically, this relates to efficiently calculating the scattering amplitudes in scalar bosonic quantum field theory, a problem that is believed to be hard using a classical computer. Building on this, we give an experimental implementation based on cluster states that is feasible with today's technology."
1063,1503.04086,2015,4,16,15,Schwartz operators,Michael Keyl;Jukka Kiukas;Reinhard F Werner,"In this paper we introduce Schwartz operators as a non-commutative analog of Schwartz functions and provide a detailed discussion of their properties. We equip them in particular with a number of different (but equivalent) families of seminorms which turns the space of Schwartz operators into a Frechet space. The study of the topological dual leads to non-commutative tempered distributions which are discussed in detail as well. We show in particular that the latter can be identified with a certain class of quadratic forms, therefore making operations like products with bounded (and also some unbounded) operators and quantum harmonic analysis available to objects which are otherwise too singular for being a Hilbert space operator. Finally we show how the new methods can be applied by studying operator moment problems and convergence properties of fluctuation operators."
1064,1502.06411,2015,3,30,15,Additive bounds of minimum output entropies for unital channels and an exact qubit formula,Motohisa Fukuda;Gilad Gour,"We investigate minimum output (Rényi) entropy of qubit channels and unital quantum channels. We obtain an exact formula for the minimum output entropy of qubit channels, and bounds for unital quantum channels. Interestingly, our bounds depend only on the operator norm of the matrix representation of the channels on the space of trace-less Hermitian operators. Moreover, since these bounds respect tensor products, we get bounds for the capacity of unital quantum channels, which is saturated by the Werner-Holevo channel. Furthermore, we construct an orthonormal basis, besides the Gell-Mann basis, for the space of trace-less Hermitian operators by using discrete Weyl operators. We apply our bounds to discrete Weyl covariant channels with this basis, and find new examples in which the minimum output Rényi $2$-entropy is additive."
1065,1502.05626,2015,3,16,15,Decoherence in open Majorana systems,Earl T Campbell,"Coupling to a thermal bath leads to decoherence of stored quantum information. For a system of Gaussian fermions, the fermionic analog of linear or Gaussian optics, these dynamics can be elegantly and efficiently described by evolution of the system's covariance matrix. Taking both system and bath to be Gaussian fermionic, we observe that decoherence occurs at a rate that is independent of the bath temperature. Furthermore, we also consider a weak coupling regime where the dynamics are Markovian. We present a microscopic derivation of Markovian master equations entirely in the language of covariance matrices, where temperature independence remains manifest. This is radically different from behaviour seen in other scenarios, such as when fermions interact with a bosonic bath. Our analysis applies to many Majorana fermion systems that have been heralded as very robust, topologically protected, qubits. In these systems, it has been claimed that thermal decoherence can be exponentially suppressed by reducing temperature, but we find Gaussian decoherence cannot be cooled away."

We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate region for this problem. The direct part of our result is proved via the measurement compression theory by Winter. Our result reveals that a helper's scheme that separately conducts a measurement and a compression is suboptimal, and the measurement compression is fundamentally needed to achieve the optimal rate region."
1067,1501.03737,2015,2,20,15,Polar codes in quantum information theory,Christoph Hirche,"Polar codes are the first capacity achieving and efficiently implementable codes for classical communication. Recently they have also been generalized to communication over classical-quantum and quantum channels. In this work we present our recent results for polar coding in quantum information theory, including applications to classical-quantum multiple access channels, interference channels and compound communication settings, including the first proof of channel coding achieving the Han-Kobayashi rate region of the interference channel without the need of a simultaneous decoder. Moreover we add to the existing framework by extending polar codes to achieve the asymmetric capacity and improving the block error probability for classical-quantum channels. In addition we use polar codes to prove a new achievable rate region for the classical-quantum broadcast channel. We also discuss polar codes for quantum communication over quantum channels and state results towards codes for compound quantum channels in this setting. We conclude by stating a list of interesting open questions to invite further research on the topic."

This text is an invitation to explore the position on the matter of Thomas Aquinas, one of the most prominent philosophers and theologians of the European Middle Ages."
1069,1501.00068,2015,1,16,15,Comparison of a quantum error correction threshold for exact and approximate errors,Mauricio Gutiérrez;Kenneth R Brown,"Classical simulations of noisy stabilizer circuits are often used to estimate the threshold of a quantum error-correcting code. Physical noise sources are efficiently approximated by random insertions of Pauli operators. For a single qubit, more accurate approximations that still allow for efficient simulation can be obtained by including Clifford operators and Pauli operators conditional on measurement in the noise model. We examine the feasibility of employing these expanded error approximations to obtain better threshold estimates. We calculate the level-1 pseudothreshold for the Steane [[7,1,3]] code for amplitude damping and dephasing along a non-Clifford axis. The expanded channels estimate the actual channel action more accurately than the Pauli channels before error correction. However, after error correction, the Pauli twirling approximation yields very accurate estimates of the performance of quantum error-correcting protocols in the presence of the actual noise channel."
1070,1412.5604,2014,1,14,15,Matrix product operators for symmetry-protected topological phases: Gauging and edge theories,Dominic J Williamson;Nick Bultinck;Michaël Mariën;Mehmet Burak Şahinoğlu;Jutho Haegeman;Frank Verstraete,"Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) provide a natural ansatz for the ground states of gapped, local Hamiltonians in which global characteristics of a quantum state are encoded in properties of local tensors. We develop a framework to describe on-site symmetries, as occurring in systems exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) quantum order, in terms of virtual symmetries of the local tensors expressed as a set of matrix product operators (MPOs) labeled by distinct group elements. These MPOs describe the possibly anomalous symmetry of the edge theory, whose local degrees of freedom are concretely identified in a PEPS. A classification of SPT phases is obtained by studying the obstructions to continuously deforming one set of MPOs into another, recovering the results derived for fixed-point models [X. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. B 87, 155114 (2013)]. Our formalism accommodates perturbations away from fixed point models, opening the possibility of studying phase transitions between different SPT phases. We also demonstrate that applying the recently developed quantum state gauging procedure to a SPT PEPS yields a PEPS with topological order determined by the initial symmetry MPOs. The MPO framework thus unifies the different approaches to classifying SPT phases, via fixed-points models, boundary anomalies, or gauging the symmetry, into the single problem of classifying inequivalent sets of matrix product operator symmetries that are defined purely in terms of a PEPS."
1071,1412.2516,2014,1,6,15,Boson Sampling is Robust to Small Errors in the Network Matrix,Alex Arkhipov,"We demonstrate the robustness of BosonSampling to imperfections in the linear optical network that cause a small deviation in the matrix it implements. We show that applying a noisy matrix $\tilde{U}$ that is within $\epsilon$ of the desired matrix $U$ in operator norm leads to an output distribution that is within $\epsilon n$ of the desired distribution in variation distance, where $n$ is the number of photons. This lets us derive a sufficient tolerance each beamsplitters and phaseshifters in the network. This result considers only errors that result from the network encoding a different unitary than desired, and not other sources of noise such as photon loss and partial distinguishability."
1072,1411.7041,2014,1,5,15,Bulk Locality and Quantum Error Correction in AdS/CFT,Ahmed Almheiri;Xi Dong;Daniel Harlow,"We point out a connection between the emergence of bulk locality in AdS/CFT and the theory of quantum error correction. Bulk notions such as Bogoliubov transformations, location in the radial direction, and the holographic entropy bound all have natural CFT interpretations in the language of quantum error correction. We also show that the question of whether bulk operator reconstruction works only in the causal wedge or all the way to the extremal surface is related to the question of whether or not the quantum error correcting code realized by AdS/CFT is also a ""quantum secret sharing scheme"", and suggest a tensor network calculation that may settle the issue. Interestingly, the version of quantum error correction which is best suited to our analysis is the somewhat nonstandard ""operator algebra quantum error correction"" of Beny, Kempf, and Kribs. Our proposal gives a precise formulation of the idea of ""subregion-subregion"" duality in AdS/CFT, and clarifies the limits of its validity."
1073,1411.6881,2014,12,9,15,Additivity rates and PPT property for random quantum channels,Motohisa Fukuda;Ion Nechita,"Inspired by Montanaro's work, we introduce the concept of additivity rates of a quantum channel $L$, which give the first order (linear) term of the minimum output $p$-Rényi entropies of $L^{\otimes r}$ as functions of $r$. We lower bound the additivity rates of arbitrary quantum channels using the operator norms of several interesting matrices including partially transposed Choi matrices. As a direct consequence, we obtain upper bounds for the classical capacity of the channels. We study these matrices for random quantum channels defined by random subspaces of a bipartite tensor product space. A detailed spectral analysis of the relevant random matrix models is performed, and strong convergence towards free probabilistic limits is showed. As a corollary, we compute the threshold for random quantum channels to have the positive partial transpose (PPT) property. We then show that a class of random PPT channels violate generically additivity of the $p$-Rényi entropy for all $p\geq30.95$."
1074,1411.2723,2014,11,27,15,Conservation of information and the foundations of quantum mechanics,Giulio Chiribella;Carlo Maria Scandolo,"We review a recent approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics inspired by quantum information theory. The approach is based on a general framework, which allows one to address a large class of physical theories which share basic information-theoretic features. We first illustrate two very primitive features, expressed by the axioms of causality and purity-preservation, which are satisfied by both classical and quantum theory. We then discuss the axiom of purification, which expresses a strong version of the Conservation of Information and captures the core of a vast number of protocols in quantum information. Purification is a highly non-classical feature and leads directly to the emergence of entanglement at the purely conceptual level, without any reference to the superposition principle. Supplemented by a few additional requirements, satisfied by classical and quantum theory, it provides a complete axiomatic characterization of quantum theory for finite dimensional systems."
1075,1410.7094,2014,11,26,15,Computable entanglement conversion witness that is better than the negativity,Mark W Girard;Gilad Gour,"The primary goal of entanglement theory is to determine convertibility conditions for two quantum states. Up until now, this has always been done with the use of entanglement monotones. With the exception of the negativity, such quantities tend to be rather uncomputable. We instead promote the idea of conversion witnesses in this paper. A conversion witness is a function on pairs of states and whose value determines whether a state can be converted into another. We construct a conversion witness that can be efficiently computed for arbitrary states in systems of any size. This conversion witness is always better than the negativity at detecting when two entangled states are not interconvertible. Furthermore, when considering states of two-qubit systems, this new conversion witness is sometimes better than the entanglement of formation. This shows that the study of conversion witness is in fact useful, and may have applications in resource theories beyond that of entanglement."

Although many decoherence mechanisms were studied and fixed in the last 5 years, the most important ones are two-level state defects in amorphous dielectrics, non-equilibrium quasiparticles generated from stray infrared light, and radiation to slotline modes. With improved design, the performance of integrated circuit transmons using the Xmon design are now close to world record performance: these devices have the advantage of retaining coherence when scaled up to 9 qubits."

We show that this thermodynamic symmetry decomposes any quantum state into mode operators that quantify the coherence present in the state. We then establish general upper and lower bounds for the evolution of quantum coherence under arbitrary thermal operations, valid for any temperature. We identify primitive coherence manipulations and show that the transfer of coherence between energy levels manifests irreversibility not captured by free energy. Moreover, the recently developed thermo-majorization relations on block-diagonal quantum states are observed to be special cases of this symmetry analysis."
1078,1410.3720,2014,10,22,15,From three-photon GHZ states to ballistic universal quantum computation,Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia;Pete Shadbolt;Daniel E Browne;Terry G Rudolph,"Single photons, manipulated using integrated linear optics, constitute a promising platform for universal quantum computation. A series of increasingly efficient proposals have shown linear-optical quantum computing to be formally scalable. However, existing schemes typically require extensive adaptive switching, which is experimentally challenging and noisy, thousands of photon sources per renormalized qubit, and/or large quantum memories for repeat-until-success strategies. Our work overcomes all these problems. We present a scheme to construct a cluster state universal for quantum computation, which uses no adaptive switching, no large memories, and which is at least an order of magnitude more resource-efficient than previous passive schemes. Unlike previous proposals, it is constructed entirely from loss-detecting gates and offers a robustness to photon loss. Even without the use of an active loss-tolerant encoding, our scheme naturally tolerates a total loss rate of $\sim 1.6\%$ in the photons detected in the gates. This scheme uses only 3-GHZ states as a resource, together with a passive linear-optical network. We fully describe and model the iterative process of cluster generation, including photon loss and gate failure. This demonstrates that building a linear optical quantum computer need be less challenging than previously thought."
1079,1410.1434,2014,10,20,15,Quantum attacks against iterated block ciphers,Marc Kaplan,"We study the amplification of security against quantum attacks provided by iteration of block ciphers. In the classical case, the Meet-in-the-middle attack is a generic attack against those constructions. This attack reduces the time required to break double iterations to only twice the time it takes to attack a single block cipher, given that the attacker has access to a large amount of memory. More abstractly, it shows that security by composition does not achieve exact multiplicative amplification. We present a quantized version of this attack based on an optimal quantum algorithm for the Element Distinctness problem. We then use the generalized adversary method to prove the optimality of the attack. An interesting corollary is that the time-space tradeoff for quantum attacks is very different from what classical attacks allow. This first result seems to indicate that composition resists better to quantum attacks than to classical ones because it prevents the quadratic speedup achieved by quantizing an exhaustive search. We investigate security amplification by composition further by examining the case of four iterations. We quantize a recent technique called the dissection attack using the framework of quantum walks. Surprisingly, this leads to better gains over classical attacks than for double iterations, which seems to indicate that when the number of iterations grows, the resistance against quantum attacks decreases."
1080,1409.4391,2014,10,15,15,Direct Sum Theorem for Bounded Round Quantum Communication Complexity,Dave Touchette,"We prove a direct sum theorem for bounded round entanglement-assisted quantum communication complexity. To do so, we use the fully quantum definition for information cost and complexity that we recently introduced, and use both the fact that information is a lower bound on the communication, and the fact that a direct sum property holds for quantum information complexity. We then give a protocol for compressing a single copy of a protocol down to its quantum information cost, up to terms depending on the number of rounds and the allowed increase in error. Two important tools to derive this protocol are a smooth conditional min-entropy bound for a one-shot quantum state redistribution protocol, and the quantum substate theorem of Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen (FOCS'02) to transform this bound into a von Neumann conditional entropy bound. This result further establishes the newly introduced notions of quantum information cost and complexity as the correct quantum generalisations of the classical ones in the standard communication complexity setting. Finding such a quantum generalization of information complexity was one of the open problem recently raised by Braverman (STOC'12)."
1081,1409.3552,2014,10,7,15,Efficient synthesis of probabilistic quantum circuits with fallback,Alex Bocharov;Martin Roetteler;Krysta M Svore,"Recently it has been shown that Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) circuits can approximate a given single-qubit unitary with an expected number of $T$ gates of about $1/3$ of what is required by optimal, deterministic, ancilla-free decompositions over the Clifford+$T$ gate set. In this work, we introduce a more general and conceptually simpler circuit decomposition method that allows for synthesis into protocols that probabilistically implement quantum circuits over several universal gate sets including, but not restricted to, the Clifford+$T$ gate set. The protocol, which we call Probabilistic Quantum Circuits with Fallback (PQF), implements a walk on a discrete Markov chain in which the target unitary is an absorbing state and in which transitions are induced by multi-qubit unitaries followed by measurements. In contrast to RUS protocols, the presented PQF protocols terminate after a finite number of steps. Specifically, we apply our method to the Clifford+$T$, Clifford+$V$, and Clifford+$\pi/12$ gate sets to achieve decompositions with expected gate counts of $\log_b(1/\varepsilon)+O(\log(\log(1/\varepsilon)))$, where $b$ is a quantity related to the expansion property of the underlying universal gate set."

In turn, it was used in by them in order to obtain sharp bounds for the violation of the additivity of the minimum output entropy for random quantum channels with Bell states. This free contraction norm, however, is difficult to compute explicitly. The purpose of this note is to give a good estimate for this norm. Our technique is based on results of super convergence in the context of free probability theory. As an application, we give a new, simple and conceptual proof of the violation of the additivity of the minimum output entropy."

We show that, in a class of MBQC, classical universality requires non-classical logic, which is 'consumed' during the course of the computation, thereby pinpointing another potential quantum computational resource."
1084,1407.2658,2014,8,19,15,Reconstructing quantum states from local data,Brian Swingle;Isaac H Kim,"We consider the problem of reconstructing global quantum states from local data. Because the reconstruction problem has many solutions in general, we consider the reconstructed state of maximum global entropy consistent with the local data. We show that unique ground states of local Hamiltonians are exactly reconstructed as the maximal entropy state. More generally, we show that if the state in question is a ground state of a local Hamiltonian with a degenerate space of locally indistinguishable ground states, then the maximal entropy state is close to the ground state projector. We also show that local reconstruction is possible for thermal states of local Hamiltonians. Finally, we discuss a procedure to certify that the reconstructed state is close to the true global state. We call the entropy of our reconstructed maximum entropy state the ""reconstruction entropy"", and we discuss its relation to emergent geometry in the context of holographic duality."
1085,1407.2256,2014,8,5,15,Inferring latent structures via information inequalities,Rafael Chaves;Lukas Luft;T O Maciel;David Gross;Dominik Janzing;B Schölkopf,"One of the goals of probabilistic inference is to decide whether an empirically observed distribution is compatible with a candidate Bayesian network. However, Bayesian networks with hidden variables give rise to highly non-trivial constraints on the observed distribution. Here, we propose an information-theoretic approach, based on the insight that conditions on entropies of Bayesian networks take the form of simple linear inequalities. We describe an algorithm for deriving entropic tests for latent structures. The well-known conditional independence tests appear as a special case. While the approach applies for generic Bayesian networks, we presently adopt the causal view, and show the versatility of the framework by treating several relevant problems from that domain: detecting common ancestors, quantifying the strength of causal influence, and inferring the direction of causation from two-variable marginals."
1086,1406.7127,2014,7,11,15,Robust and versatile black-box certification of quantum devices,Tzyh Haur Yang;Tamas Vértesi;Jean-Daniel Bancal;Valerio Scarani;Miguel Navascués,"Self-testing refers to the fact that, in some quantum devices, both states and measurements can be assessed in a black-box scenario, on the sole basis of the observed statistics, i.e. without reference to any prior device calibration. Only a few examples of self-testing are known, and they just provide non-trivial assessment for devices performing unrealistically close to the ideal case. We overcome these difficulties by approaching self-testing with the semi-definite programming hierarchy for the characterization of quantum correlations. This allows us to improve dramatically the robustness of previous self-testing schemes -e.g.: we show that a CHSH violation larger than 2.57 certifies a singlet fidelity of more than 70%. In addition, the versatility of the tool brings about self-testing of hitherto impossible cases, such as robust self-testing of non-maximally entangled two-qutrit states in the CGLMP scenario."
1087,1405.7479,2014,7,10,15,A quantum algorithm for Viterbi decoding of classical convolutional codes,Jon R Grice;David A Meyer,"We present a quantum Viterbi algorithm (QVA) with better than classical performance under certain conditions. In this paper the proposed algorithm is applied to decoding classical convolutional codes, for instance; large constraint length $Q$ and short decode frames $N$. Other applications of the classical Viterbi algorithm where $Q$ is large (e.g. speech processing) could experience significant speedup with the QVA. The QVA exploits the fact that the decoding trellis is similar to the butterfly diagram of the fast Fourier transform, with its corresponding fast quantum algorithm. The tensor-product structure of the butterfly diagram corresponds to a quantum superposition that we show can be efficiently prepared. The quantum speedup is possible because the performance of the QVA depends on the fanout (number of possible transitions from any given state in the hidden Markov model) which is in general much less than $Q$. The QVA constructs a superposition of states which correspond to all legal paths through the decoding lattice, with phase a function of the probability of the path being taken given received data. A specialized amplitude amplification procedure is applied one or more times to recover a superposition where the most probable path has a high probability of being measured."
1088,1405.7381,2014,6,30,15,On computation with 'probabilities' modulo k,Niel de Beaudrap,"We propose a framework to study models of computation of indeterministic data, represented by abstract ""distributions"". In these distributions, probabilities are replaced by ""amplitudes"" drawn from a fixed semi-ring $S$, of which the non-negative reals, the complex numbers, finite fields $\mathbb F_{p^r}$, and cyclic rings $\mathbb Z_k$ are examples. Varying $S$ yields different models of computation, which we may investigate to better understand the (likely) difference in power between randomised and quantum computation. The ""modal quantum states"" of Schumacher and Westmoreland [arXiv:1010.2929] are examples of such distributions, for $S$ a finite field. For $S = \mathbb F_2$, Willcock and Sabry [arXiv:1102.3587] show that UNIQUE-SAT is solvable by polynomial-time uniform circuit families consisting of invertible gates. We characterize the decision problems solvable by polynomial uniform circuit families, using either invertible or ""unitary"" transformations over cyclic rings $S = \mathbb Z_k$, or (in the case that $k$ is a prime power) finite fields $S = \mathbb F_k$. In particular, for $k$ a prime power, these are precisely the problems in the class $\mathsf{Mod}_k\mathsf P$."
1089,1405.6015,2014,5,30,15,Multipartite Quantum Correlation and Communication Complexities,Rahul Jain;Zhaohui Wei;Penghui Yao;Shengyu Zhang,"The concepts of quantum correlation complexity and quantum communication complexity were recently proposed to quantify the minimum amount of resources needed in generating bipartite classical or quantum states in the single-shot setting. The former is the minimum size of the initially shared state $\sigma$ on which local operations by the two parties (without communication) can generate the target state $\rho$, and the latter is the minimum amount of communication needed when initially sharing nothing. In this paper, we generalize these two concepts to multipartite cases, for both exact and approximate state generation. Our results are summarized as follows. (1) For multipartite pure states, the correlation complexity can be completely characterized by local ranks of sybsystems. (2) We extend the notion of PSD-rank of matrices to that of tensors, and use it to bound the quantum correlation complexity for generating multipartite classical distributions. (3) For generating multipartite mixed quantum states, communication complexity is not always equal to correlation complexity (as opposed to bipartite case). But they differ by at most a factor of 2. Generating a multipartite mixed quantum state has the same communication complexity as generating its optimal purification. But for correlation complexity of these two tasks can be different (though still related by less than a factor of 2). (4) To generate a bipartite classical distribution $P(x,y)$ approximately, the quantum communication complexity is completely characterized by the approximate PSD-rank of $P$. The quantum correlation complexity of approximately generating multipartite pure states is bounded by approximate local ranks."

We show that the statistics of data from syndrome measurements can be used to do the following: (i) estimation of parameters of an error channel, including the ability correct away the invertible part of the error channel, once it is estimated; (ii) hypothesis testing (or model selection) to distinguish error channels, e.g., to determine if the errors are correlated. The unifying theme is to make use of all of the information in the statistics of the data collected from syndrome measurements using machine learning and control algorithms."
1091,1405.2749,2014,5,26,15,A quantum algorithm for additive approximation of Ising partition functions,Akira Matsuo;Keisuke Fujii;Nobuyuki Imoto,"We investigate quantum computational complexity of calculating partition functions of Ising models. We construct a quantum algorithm for an additive approximation of Ising partition functions on square lattices. To this end, we utilize the overlap mapping developed by Van den Nest, Dür, and Briegel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 117207 (2007)] and its interpretation through measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). We specify an algorithmic domain, on which the proposed algorithm works, and an approximation scale, which determines the accuracy of the approximation. We show that the proposed algorithm does a nontrivial task, which would be intractable on any classical computer, by showing the problem solvable by the proposed quantum algorithm are BQP-complete. In the construction of the BQP-complete problem coupling strengths and magnetic fields take complex values. However, the Ising models that are of central interest in statistical physics and computer science consist of real coupling strengths and magnetic fields. Thus we extend the algorithmic domain of the proposed algorithm to such a real physical parameter region and calculate the approximation scale explicitly. We found that the overlap mapping and its MBQC interpretation improves the approximation scale exponentially compared to a straightforward constant depth quantum algorithm. On the other hand, the proposed quantum algorithm also provides us a partial evidence that there exist no efficient classical algorithm for a multiplicative approximation of the Ising partition functions even on the square lattice. This result supports that the proposed quantum algorithm does a nontrivial task also in the physical parameter region."

Although they were developed in different ways, we show that they are all applications of a more general principle given by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We explain this general principle and show how to derive with it not only already known but also new entanglement criteria. We systematically investigate its potential and limits to detect bipartite and multipartite entanglement."
1093,1404.7439,2014,5,13,15,Lattice Gauge Tensor Networks,Pietro Silvi;Enrique Rico;Tommaso Calarco;Simone Montangero,"We present a unified framework to describe lattice gauge theories by means of tensor networks: this framework is efficient as it exploits the high amount of local symmetry content native of these systems describing only the gauge invariant subspace. Compared to a standard tensor network description, the gauge invariant one allows to speed-up real and imaginary time evolution of a factor that is up to the square of the dimension of the link variable. The gauge invariant tensor network description is based on the quantum link formulation, a compact and intuitive formulation for gauge theories on the lattice, and it is alternative to and can be combined with the global symmetric tensor network description. We present some paradigmatic examples that show how this architecture might be used to describe the physics of condensed matter and high-energy physics systems. Finally, we present a cellular automata analysis which estimates the gauge invariant Hilbert space dimension as a function of the number of lattice sites and that might guide the search for effective simplified models of complex theories."
1094,1404.3733,2014,5,6,15,Quantum Information Complexity and Amortized Communication,Dave Touchette,"We define a new notion of information cost for quantum protocols, and a corresponding notion of quantum information complexity for bipartite quantum channels, and then investigate the properties of such quantities. These are the fully quantum generalizations of the analogous quantities for bipartite classical functions that have found many applications recently, in particular for proving communication complexity lower bounds. Our definition is strongly tied to the quantum state redistribution task. Previous attempts have been made to define such a quantity for quantum protocols, with particular applications in mind; our notion differs from these in many respects. First, it directly provides a lower bound on the quantum communication cost, independent of the number of rounds of the underlying protocol. Secondly, we provide an operational interpretation for quantum information complexity: we show that it is exactly equal to the amortized quantum communication complexity of a bipartite channel on a given state. This generalizes a result of Braverman and Rao to quantum protocols, and even strengthens the classical result in a bounded round scenario. Also, this provides an analogue of the Schumacher source compression theorem for interactive quantum protocols, and answers a question raised by Braverman. We also discuss some potential applications to quantum communication complexity lower bounds by specializing our definition for classical functions and inputs. Building on work of Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen, we provide new evidence suggesting that the bounded round quantum communication complexity of the disjointness function is \Omega (n/M + M), for M-message protocols. This would match the best known upper bound."
1095,1403.3357,2014,4,30,15,Maximally nonlocal theories cannot be maximally random,Gonzalo de la Torre;Matty J Hoban;Chirag Dhara;Giuseppe Prettico;Antonio Acín,"Correlations that violate a Bell Inequality are said to be nonlocal, i.e. they do not admit a local and deterministic explanation. Great effort has been devoted to study how the amount of nonlocality (as measured by a Bell inequality violation) serves to quantify the amount of randomness present in observed correlations. In this work we reverse this research program and ask what do the randomness certification capabilities of a theory tell us about the nonlocality of that theory. We find that, contrary to initial intuition, maximally nonlocal theories cannot allow maximal randomness certification. We go on and show that quantum theory, in contrast, permits certification of maximal randomness in all dichotomic scenarios. We hence pose the question of whether quantum theory is optimal for randomness, i.e. is it the most nonlocal theory that allows maximal randomness certification? We answer this question in the negative by identifying a larger-than-quantum set of correlations capable of this feat. Not only are these results relevant to understanding quantum mechanics' fundamental features, but also put fundamental restrictions on device-independent protocols based on the no-signaling principle."
1096,1401.7658,2014,4,16,15,Upper bounds on the error probabilities and asymptotic error exponents in quantum multiple state discrimination,Koenraad M R Audenaert;Milán Mosonyi,"We consider the multiple hypothesis testing problem for symmetric quantum state discrimination between r given states \sigma_1,...,\sigma_r. By splitting up the overall test into multiple binary tests in various ways we obtain a number of upper bounds on the optimal error probability in terms of the binary error probabilities. These upper bounds allow us to deduce various bounds on the asymptotic error rate, for which it has been hypothesised that it is given by the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound (or Chernoff divergence) C(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_r), as recently introduced by Nussbaum and Szkoła in analogy with Salikhov's classical multi-hypothesis Chernoff bound. This quantity is defined as the minimum of the pairwise binary Chernoff divergences min_j<kC(\sigma_j,\sigma_k). It was known already that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between C/3 and C, and that for certain classes of sets of states the bound is actually achieved. It was known to be achieved, in particular, when the state pair that is closest together in Chernoff divergence is more than 6 times closer than the next closest pair. Our results improve on this in two ways. Firstly, we show that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between C/2 and C. Secondly, we show that the Chernoff bound is already achieved when the closest state pair is more than 2 times closer than the next closest pair. We also show that the Chernoff bound is achieved when at least $r-2$ of the states are pure, improving on a previous result by Nussbaum and Szkoła. Finally, we indicate a number of potential pathways along which a proof (or disproof) may eventually be found that the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound is always achieved."

We show that the minimal degree of the former equals (up to a factor of 2) the minimal query complexity of the latter. We give optimal (up to constant factors) quantum algorithms with postselection for the Majority function, slightly improving upon an earlier algorithm of Aaronson. Finally we show how Newman's classic theorem about low-degree rational approximation of the absolute-value function follows from these algorithms."

Practical quantum computers will necessarily operate below these thresholds meaning that other performance indicators become important. In this work we consider the scaling of the logical error rate of the toric code and demonstrate how, in turn, this may be used to calculate a key performance indicator. We use a perfect matching decoding algorithm to find the scaling of the logical error rate and find two distinct operating regimes. The first regime admits a universal scaling analysis due to a mapping to a statistical physics model. The second regime characterizes the behavior in the limit of small physical error rate and can be understood by counting the error configurations leading to the failure of the decoder. We present a conjecture for the ranges of validity of these two regimes and use them to quantify the overhead -- the total number of physical qubits required to perform error correction."
1099,1312.4989,2013,1,7,15,Maximal Privacy Without Coherence,Debbie W Leung;Ke Li;Graeme Smith;John A Smolin,"Privacy lies at the fundament of quantum mechanics. A coherently transmitted quantum state is inherently private. Remarkably, coherent quantum communication is not a prerequisite for privacy: there are quantum channels that are too noisy to transmit any quantum information reliably that can nevertheless send private classical information. Here, we ask how much private classical information a channel can transmit if it has little quantum capacity. We present a class of channels N_d with input dimension d^2, quantum capacity Q(N_d) <= 1, and private capacity P(N_d) = log d. These channels asymptotically saturate an interesting inequality P(N) <= (log d_A + Q(N))/2 for any channel N with input dimension d_A, and capture the essence of privacy stripped of the confounding influence of coherence."
1100,1312.4673,2013,12,19,15,Generalized Quantum Arthur-Merlin Games,Hirotada Kobayashi;François Le Gall;Harumichi Nishimura,"This paper investigates the role of interaction and coins in public-coin quantum interactive proof systems (also called quantum Arthur-Merlin games). While prior works focused on classical public coins even in the quantum setting, the present work introduces a generalized version of quantum Arthur-Merlin games where the public coins can be quantum as well: the verifier can send not only random bits, but also halves of EPR pairs. First, it is proved that the class of two-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin games with quantum public coins, denoted qq-QAM in this paper, does not change by adding a constant number of turns of classical interactions prior to the communications of the qq-QAM proof systems. This can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the celebrated collapse theorem for AM due to Babai. To prove this collapse theorem, this paper provides a natural complete problem for qq-QAM: deciding whether the output of a given quantum circuit is close to a totally mixed state. This complete problem is on the very line of the previous studies investigating the hardness of checking the properties related to quantum circuits, and is of independent interest. It is further proved that the class qq-QAM_1 of two-turn quantum-public-coin quantum Arthur-Merlin proof systems with perfect completeness gives new bounds for standard well-studied classes of two-turn interactive proof systems. Finally, the collapse theorem above is extended to comprehensively classify the role of interaction and public coins in quantum Arthur-Merlin games: it is proved that, for any constant m>1, the class of problems having an m-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin proof system is either equal to PSPACE or equal to the class of problems having a two-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin game of a specific type, which provides a complete set of quantum analogues of Babai's collapse theorem."

We show that when this model has a local PT symmetry acting on composite systems it violates the non-signaling principle of relativity. Since the case of global PT symmetry is known to reduce to standard quantum mechanics, this shows that the PT-symmetric theory is either a trivial extension or likely false as a fundamental theory."
1102,1311.5186,2013,12,18,15,"Information Causality, Szemerédi-Trotter and Algebraic Variants of CHSH",Mohammad Bavarian;Peter W Shor,"In this work, we consider the following family of two prover one-round games. In the CHSH_q game, two parties are given x,y in F_q uniformly at random, and each must produce an output a,b in F_q without communicating with the other. The players' objective is to maximize the probability that their outputs satisfy a+b=xy in F_q. This game was introduced by Buhrman and Massar (PRA 2005) as a large alphabet generalization of the celebrated CHSH game---which is one of the most well-studied two-prover games in quantum information theory, and which has a large number of applications to quantum cryptography and quantum complexity. Our main contributions in this paper are the first asymptotic and explicit bounds on the entangled and classical values of CHSH_q, and the realization of a rather surprising connection between CHSH_q and geometric incidence theory. On the way to these results, we also resolve a problem of Pawlowski and Winter about pairwise independent Information Causality, which, beside being interesting on its own, gives as an application a short proof of our upper bound for the entangled value of CHSH_q."

The physical resource, known here as the dual-rail quantum wire, can be generated using temporally multiplexed offline squeezing and linear optics or by using a single optical parametric oscillator. We focus on an important class of quantum gates, specifically Gaussian unitaries that act on single modes, which gives universal quantum computation when supplemented with multi-mode operations and photon-counting measurements. The dual-rail wire supports two routes for applying single-qumode Gaussian unitaries: the first is to use traditional one-dimensional quantum-wire cluster-state measurement protocols. The second takes advantage of the dual-rail quantum wire in order to apply unitaries by measuring pairs of qumodes called macronodes. We analyze and compare these methods in terms of the suitability for implementing single-qumode Gaussian measurement-based quantum computation."
1104,1310.7028,2013,11,21,15,Multiplicativity of completely bounded $p$-norms implies a strong converse for entanglement-assisted capacity,Manish K Gupta;Mark M Wilde,"The fully quantum reverse Shannon theorem establishes the optimal rate of noiseless classical communication required for simulating the action of many instances of a noisy quantum channel on an arbitrary input state, while also allowing for an arbitrary amount of shared entanglement of an arbitrary form. Turning this theorem around establishes a strong converse for the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of any quantum channel. This paper proves the strong converse for entanglement-assisted capacity by a completely different approach and identifies a bound on the strong converse exponent for this task. Namely, we exploit the recent entanglement-assisted ""meta-converse"" theorem of Matthews and Wehner, several properties of the recently established sandwiched Renyi relative entropy (also referred to as the quantum Renyi divergence), and the multiplicativity of completely bounded $p$-norms due to Devetak et al. The proof here demonstrates the extent to which the Arimoto approach can be helpful in proving strong converse theorems, it provides an operational relevance for the multiplicativity result of Devetak et al., and it adds to the growing body of evidence that the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is the correct quantum generalization of the classical concept for all $\alpha>1$."
1105,1309.6586,2013,11,15,15,The resource theory of informational nonequilibrium in thermodynamics,Gilad Gour;Markus P Müller;Varun Narasimhachar;Robert W Spekkens;Nicole Yunger Halpern,"We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies. Quantum state conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible."

This correspondence allows us to state and prove the POVM version of classical results from the local theory of Banach spaces about the approximation of zonoids by zonotopes. We show that on $\mathbf{C}^d$, the uniform POVM (the most symmetric POVM) can be sparsified, i.e. approximated by a discrete POVM, the latter having only $O(d^2)$ outcomes. We also show that similar (but weaker) approximation results actually hold for any POVM on $\mathbf{C}^d$. By defining an appropriate notion of tensor product for zonoids, we are then able to extend our results to the multipartite setting: we show, roughly speaking, that local POVMs may be sparsified locally. In particular, the local uniform POVM on $\mathbf{C}^{d_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbf{C}^{d_k}$ can be approximated by a discrete POVM which is local and has $O(d_1^2\times\cdots\times d_k^2)$ outcomes."

We introduce the notion of an interactive observable and we show that any unitary channel acting on a $d$-level quantum system can be uniquely identified among all other channels (unitary or otherwise) with only $O(d^2)$ interactive observables, as opposed to the $O(d^4)$ required for tomography of arbitrary channels. This result generalizes, so that channels with at most $q$ Kraus operators can be identified with only $O(qd^2)$ interactive observables. Slight improvements can be obtained if we wish to identify such a channel only among unital channels or among other channels with $q$ Kraus operators. These results are proven via explicit construction of large subspaces of Hermitian matrices with various conditions on rank, eigenvalues, and partial trace. Our constructions are built upon various forms of totally nonsingular matrices."

We provide results leading to a local definition of temperature, thereby extending the notion of ""intensivity of temperature"" to interacting quantum models. More precisely, we derive a perturbation formula for thermal states. The influence of the perturbation is exactly given in terms of a generalized covariance. For this covariance, we prove exponential clustering of correlations above a universal critical temperature that upper bounds physical critical temperatures such as the Curie temperature. As a corollary, we obtain that above the critical temperature, thermal states are stable against distant Hamiltonian perturbations. Moreover, our results imply that above the critical temperature, local expectation values can be approximated efficiently in the error and the system size."

We consider two such descriptions: (i) as a matrix product density operator of bond dimension D, and (ii) as a purification that is written as a matrix product state of bond dimension D'. We show that these descriptions are inequivalent in the sense that D' cannot be upper bounded by D only. Then we provide two constructive methods to obtain (ii) out of (i). The sum of squares (sos) polynomial method scales exponentially in the number of different eigenvalues, and its approximate version is formulated as a Semidefinite Program, which gives efficient approximate purifications whose D' only depends on D. The eigenbasis method scales quadratically in the number of eigenvalues, and its approximate version is very efficient for rapidly decaying distributions of eigenvalues. Our results imply that a description of mixed states which is both efficient and locally positive semidefinite does not exist, but that good approximations do."
1110,1308.1737,2013,9,4,15,When do Local Operations and Classical Communication Suffice for Two-Qubit State Discrimination?,Eric Chitambar;Runyao Duan;Min-Hsiu Hsieh,"In this paper we consider the conditions under which a given ensemble of two-qubit states can be optimally distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We begin by completing the \emphperfect distinguishability problem of two-qubit ensembles - both for separable operations and LOCC - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state. Then for the well-known task of minimum error discrimination, it is shown that \textitalmost all two-qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states cannot be optimally discriminated using LOCC. This is surprising considering that \textitany two pure states can be distinguished optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given to ensembles that lack entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition for when a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by LOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as ""non-locality without entanglement"". We next consider an example of $N$ parties who each share the same state but who are ignorant of its identity. The state is drawn from the rotationally invariant ""trine ensemble"", and we establish a tight connection between the $N$-copy ensemble and Shor's ""lifted"" single-copy ensemble. For any finite $N$, we prove that optimal identification of the states cannot be achieved by LOCC; however as $N\to\infty$, LOCC can indeed discriminate the states optimally. This is the first result of its kind. Finally, we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower bounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states. When applied to the double trine ensemble, this leads to a rather different distinguishability character than when the minimum-error probability is considered."

Separable operations are strictly more powerful than LOCC, but no simple explanation of this phenomenon is known. We show that, in the case of von Neumann measurements, the ability to interpolate measurements is an operational principle that sets apart LOCC and separable operations."

This violation is the first experiment with photons to close the detection loophole, and we demonstrate enough ""efficiency"" overhead to eventually perform a fully loophole-free test of local realism. The entanglement quality is verified by maximally violating additional Bell tests, testing the upper limit of quantum correlations. Finally, we use the source to generate secure private quantum random numbers at rates over 4 orders of magnitude beyond previous experiments."
1113,1306.5753,2013,6,26,15,Area laws in a many-body localized state and its implications for topological order,Bela Bauer;Chetan Nayak,"The question whether Anderson insulators can persist to finite-strength interactions - a scenario dubbed many-body localization - has recently received a great deal of interest. The origin of such a many-body localized phase has been described as localization in Fock space, a picture we examine numerically. We then formulate a precise sense in which a single energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian can be adiabatically connected to a state of a non-interacting Anderson insulator. We call such a state a many-body localized state and define a many-body localized phase as one in which almost all states are many-body localized states. We explore the possible consequences of this; the most striking is an area law for the entanglement entropy of almost all excited states in a many-body localized phase. We present the results of numerical calculations for a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions. Our results are consistent with an area law and, by implication, many-body localization for almost all states and almost all regions for weak enough interactions and strong disorder. However, there are rare regions and rare states with much larger entanglement entropies. Furthermore, we study the implications that many-body localization may have for topological phases and self-correcting quantum memories. We find that there are scenarios in which many-body localization can help to stabilize topological order at non-zero energy density, and we propose potentially useful criteria to confirm these scenarios."
1114,1306.3995,2013,6,25,15,Boson-Sampling in the light of sample complexity,Christian Gogolin;Martin Kliesch;Leandro Aolita;Jens Eisert,"Boson-Sampling is a classically computationally hard problem that can - in principle - be efficiently solved with quantum linear optical networks. Very recently, a rush of experimental activity has ignited with the aim of developing such devices as feasible instances of quantum simulators. Even approximate Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard with high probability if the unitary describing the optical network is drawn from the Haar measure. In this work we show that in this setup, with probability exponentially close to one in the number of bosons, no symmetric algorithm can distinguish the Boson-Sampling distribution from the uniform one from fewer than exponentially many samples. This means that the two distributions are operationally indistinguishable without detailed a priori knowledge. We carefully discuss the prospects of efficiently using knowledge about the implemented unitary for devising non-symmetric algorithms that could potentially improve upon this. We conclude that due to the very fact that Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard, efficient classical certification of Boson-Sampling devices seems to be out of reach."
1115,1306.3142,2013,6,25,15,On quantum Renyi entropies: a new generalization and some properties,Martin Müller-Lennert;Frédéric Dupuis;Oleg Szehr;Serge Fehr;Marco Tomamichel,"The Renyi entropies constitute a family of information measures that generalizes the well-known Shannon entropy, inheriting many of its properties. They appear in the form of unconditional and conditional entropies, relative entropies or mutual information, and have found many applications in information theory and beyond. Various generalizations of Renyi entropies to the quantum setting have been proposed, most notably Petz's quasi-entropies and Renner's conditional min-, max- and collision entropy. Here, we argue that previous quantum extensions are incompatible and thus unsatisfactory. We propose a new quantum generalization of the family of Renyi entropies that contains the von Neumann entropy, min-entropy, collision entropy and the max-entropy as special cases, thus encompassing most quantum entropies in use today. We show several natural properties for this definition, including data-processing inequalities, a duality relation, and an entropic uncertainty relation."
1116,1306.0159,2013,6,18,15,The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine,Scott Aaronson,"In honor of Alan Turing's hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about one of Turing's obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and free will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call ""Knightian freedom"": a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries to find scope for ""freedom"" in the universe's boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems. I investigate how far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the way, encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb's paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time, quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old philosophical debate into some underexplored territory."
1117,1305.6626,2013,6,14,15,Robust Randomness Amplifiers: Upper and Lower Bounds,Matthew Coudron;Thomas Vidick;Henry Yuen,"A recent sequence of works, initially motivated by the study of the nonlocal properties of entanglement, demonstrate that a source of information-theoretically certified randomness can be constructed based only on two simple assumptions: the prior existence of a short random seed and the ability to ensure that two black-box devices do not communicate (i.e. are non-signaling). We call protocols achieving such certified amplification of a short random seed randomness amplifiers. We introduce a simple framework in which we initiate the systematic study of the possibilities and limitations of randomness amplifiers. Our main results include a new, improved analysis of a robust randomness amplifier with exponential expansion, as well as the first upper bounds on the maximum expansion achievable by a broad class of randomness amplifiers. In particular, we show that non-adaptive randomness amplifiers that are robust to noise cannot achieve more than doubly exponential expansion. Finally, we show that a wide class of protocols based on the use of the CHSH game can only lead to (singly) exponential expansion if adversarial devices are allowed the full power of non-signaling strategies. Our upper bound results apply to all known non-adaptive randomness amplifier constructions to date."
1118,1305.5591,2013,6,4,15,Lower bounds to the spectral gap of Davies generators,Kristan Temme,"We construct lower bounds to the spectral gap of a family of Lindblad generators known as Davies maps. These maps describe the thermalization of quantum systems weakly coupled to a heat bath. The steady state of these systems is given by the Gibbs distribution with respect to the system Hamiltonian. The bounds can be evaluated explicitly, when the eigenbasis and the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is known. A crucial assumption is that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we provide a counterexample to the conjecture, that the convergence rate is always determined by the gap of the associated Pauli master equation. We conclude, that the full dynamics of the Lindblad generator has to be considered. Finally, we present several physical example systems for which the bound to the spectral gap is evaluated."
1119,1305.1316,2013,5,29,15,Entanglement sampling and applications,Frédéric Dupuis;Omar Fawzi;Stephanie Wehner,"A natural measure for the amount of quantum information that a physical system E holds about another system A = A_1,...,A_n is given by the min-entropy Hmin(A|E). Specifically, the min-entropy measures the amount of entanglement between E and A, and is the relevant measure when analyzing a wide variety of problems ranging from randomness extraction in quantum cryptography, decoupling used in channel coding, to physical processes such as thermalization or the thermodynamic work cost (or gain) of erasing a quantum system. As such, it is a central question to determine the behaviour of the min-entropy after some process M is applied to the system A. Here we introduce a new generic tool relating the resulting min-entropy to the original one, and apply it to several settings of interest, including sampling of subsystems and measuring in a randomly chosen basis. The sampling results lead to new upper bounds on quantum random access codes, and imply the existence of ""local decouplers"". The results on random measurements yield new high-order entropic uncertainty relations with which we prove the optimality of cryptographic schemes in the bounded quantum storage model."
1120,1304.6351,2013,5,27,15,Universal Uncertainty Relations,Shmuel Friedland;Vlad Gheorghiu;Gilad Gour,"Uncertainty relations are a distinctive characteristic of quantum theory that impose intrinsic limitations on the precision with which physical properties can be simultaneously determined. The modern work on uncertainty relations employs \emphentropic measures to quantify the lack of knowledge associated with measuring non-commuting observables. However, there is no fundamental reason for using entropies as quantifiers; any functional relation that characterizes the uncertainty of the measurement outcomes defines an uncertainty relation. Starting from a very reasonable assumption of invariance under mere relabelling of the measurement outcomes, we show that Schur-concave functions are the most general uncertainty quantifiers. We then discover a fine-grained uncertainty relation that is given in terms of the majorization order between two probability vectors, \textcolorblacksignificantly extending a majorization-based uncertainty relation first introduced in [M. H. Partovi, Phys. Rev. A \textbf84, 052117 (2011)]. Such a vector-type uncertainty relation generates an infinite family of distinct scalar uncertainty relations via the application of arbitrary uncertainty quantifiers. Our relation is therefore universal and captures the essence of uncertainty in quantum theory."
1121,1304.5007,2013,5,7,15,Building one-time memories from isolated qubits,Yi-Kai Liu,"One-time memories (OTM's) are simple tamper-resistant cryptographic devices, which can be used to implement one-time programs, a very general form of software protection and program obfuscation. Here we investigate the possibility of building OTM's using quantum mechanical devices. It is known that OTM's cannot exist in a fully-quantum world or in a fully-classical world. Instead, we propose a new model based on ""isolated qubits"" -- qubits that can only be accessed using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). This model combines a quantum resource (single-qubit measurements) with a classical restriction (on communication between qubits), and can be implemented using current technologies, such as nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. In this model, we construct OTM's that are information-theoretically secure against one-pass LOCC adversaries that use 2-outcome measurements. Our construction resembles Wiesner's old idea of quantum conjugate coding, implemented using random error-correcting codes; our proof of security uses entropy chaining to bound the supremum of a suitable empirical process. In addition, we conjecture that our random codes can be replaced by some class of efficiently-decodable codes, to get computationally-efficient OTM's that are secure against computationally-bounded LOCC adversaries. In addition, we construct data-hiding states, which allow an LOCC sender to encode an (n-O(1))-bit messsage into n qubits, such that at most half of the message can be extracted by a one-pass LOCC receiver, but the whole message can be extracted by a general quantum receiver."

In the first area, we demonstrate a polynomial-time (classical) approximation algorithm for dense instances of the canonical QMA-complete quantum constraint satisfaction problem, the local Hamiltonian problem. In the opposite direction, we next introduce a quantum generalization of the polynomial-time hierarchy, and define problems which we prove are not only complete for the second level of this hierarchy, but are in fact hard to approximate. In the second area, we study variants of the interesting and stubbornly open question of whether a quantum proof system with multiple unentangled quantum provers is equal in expressive power to a proof system with a single quantum prover. Our results concern classes such as BellQMA(poly), and include a novel proof of perfect parallel repetition for SepQMA(m) based on cone programming duality. In the third area, we study non-classical quantum correlations beyond entanglement, often dubbed ""non-classicality"". Among our results are two novel schemes for quantifying non-classicality: The first proposes the new paradigm of exploiting local unitary operations to study non-classical correlations, and the second introduces a protocol through which non-classical correlations in a starting system can be ""activated"" into distillable entanglement with an ancilla system. An introduction to all required linear algebra and quantum mechanics is included."
1123,1301.1363,2013,4,19,15,Quantum Systems on Non-$k$-Hyperfinite Complexes: A Generalization of Classical Statistical Mechanics on Expander Graphs,Michael H Freedman;Matthew B Hastings,"We construct families of cell complexes that generalize expander graphs. These families are called non-$k$-hyperfinite, generalizing the idea of a non-hyperfinite (NH) family of graphs. Roughly speaking, such a complex has the property that one cannot remove a small fraction of points and be left with an object that looks $k-1$-dimensional at large scales. We then consider certain quantum systems on these complexes. A future goal is to construct a family of Hamiltonians such that every low energy state has topological order as part of an attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture. This goal is approached by constructing a toric code Hamiltonian with the property that every low energy state without vertex defects has topological order, a property that would not hold for any local system in any lattice $Z^d$ or indeed on any 1-hyperfinite complex. Further, such NH complexes find application in quantum coding theory. The hypergraph product codes[1] of Tillich and Zémor are generalized using NH complexes."
1124,1210.3279,2012,1,15,15,On the Power of Non-Adaptive Learning Graphs,Aleksandrs Belovs;Ansis Rosmanis,"We introduce a notion of the quantum query complexity of a certificate structure. This is a formalisation of a well-known observation that many quantum query algorithms only require the knowledge of the disposition of possible certificates in the input string, not the precise values therein. Next, we derive a dual formulation of the complexity of a non-adaptive learning graph, and use it to show that non-adaptive learning graphs are tight for all certificate structures. By this, we mean that there exists a function possessing the certificate structure and such that a learning graph gives an optimal quantum query algorithm for it. For a special case of certificate structures generated by certificates of bounded size, we construct a relatively general class of functions having this property. The construction is based on orthogonal arrays, and generalizes the quantum query lower bound for the $k$-sum problem derived recently in arXiv:1206.6528. Finally, we use these results to show that the learning graph for the triangle problem from arXiv:1210.1014 is almost optimal in these settings. This also gives a quantum query lower bound for the triangle-sum problem."

In this note we discuss how hypercontractive inequalities, in various settings, can be used to obtain (fairly) concise proofs of several results in quantum information theory: a recent lower bound of Lancien and Winter on the bias achievable by local measurements which are 4-designs; spectral concentration bounds for k-local Hamiltonians; and a recent result of Pellegrino and Seoane-Sepulveda giving general lower bounds on the classical bias obtainable in multiplayer XOR games."

Prior to the application of the field quantum information is localized on one boundary of the device, and after the application of the field this information has propagated to the other side of the device with a quantum circuit applied to the information. The applied circuit depends on the many-body Hamiltonian of the material, and the computation takes place in a degenerate ground space with symmetry-protected topological order. Such adiabatic quantum transistors are universal adiabatic quantum computing devices which have the added benefit of being modular. Here we describe this model, provide arguments for why it is an efficient model of quantum computing, and examine these many-body systems in the presence of a noisy environment."

In so doing, we offer an intuitive picture on how a spectral gap restricts the correlations that a ground state can accommodate and leads to such a special feature."

We employ a similar formalism as used in the multi-scale representation of quantum many-body wavefunctions using unitary circuits, further cementing the relation established in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 140403 (2016)] between classical and quantum multi-scale methods. An algorithm for constructing the circuit representation of known orthogonal, dyadic, discrete WTs is presented, and the explicit representation for Daubechies wavelets, coiflets, and symlets is provided. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of the circuit formalism in designing novel WTs, including various classes of symmetric wavelets and multi-wavelets, boundary wavelets and biorthogonal wavelets."

Its application to systems with more than a few constituents (e.g. particles) soon becomes impractical as the effort required grows exponentially in the number of constituents. Developing more efficient techniques is particularly pressing as precisely-controllable quantum systems that are well beyond the reach of QST are emerging in laboratories. Motivated by this, there is a considerable ongoing effort to develop new characterisation tools for quantum many-body systems. Here we demonstrate Matrix Product State (MPS) tomography, which is theoretically proven to allow the states of a broad class of quantum systems to be accurately estimated with an effort that increases efficiently with constituent number. We first prove that this broad class includes the out-of-equilbrium states produced by 1D systems with finite-range interactions, up to any fixed point in time. We then use the technique to reconstruct the dynamical state of a trapped-ion quantum simulator comprising up to 14 entangled spins (qubits): a size far beyond the reach of QST. Our results reveal the dynamical growth of entanglement and description complexity as correlations spread out during a quench: a necessary condition for future beyond-classical performance. MPS tomography should find widespread use to study large quantum many-body systems and to benchmark and verify quantum simulators and computers."

By establishing a correspondence between the first two terms in the variational expansion and the Gaussian Effective Potential, we can exactly solve for a variational approximation to the cMERA entangler. As examples, we treat scalar $\varphi^4$ theory and the Gross-Neveu model and extract non-perturbative behavior. We also comment on the connection between generalized squeezed coherent states and more generic entanglers."
1131,1611.09165,2016,12,9,14,Optimal estimation and discrimination of excess noise in thermal and amplifier channels,Masahiro Takeoka;Mark M Wilde,"We determine a fundamental upper bound on the performance of any adaptive protocol for discrimination or estimation of a channel which has an unknown parameter encoded in the state of its environment. Since our approach relies on the principle of data processing, the bound applies to a variety of discrimination measures, including quantum relative entropy, hypothesis testing relative entropy, Rényi relative entropy, fidelity, and quantum Fisher information. We apply the upper bound to thermal (amplifier) channels with a known transmissivity (gain) but unknown excess noise. In these cases, we find that the upper bounds are achievable for several discrimination measures of interest, and the method for doing so is non-adaptive, employing a highly squeezed two-mode vacuum state at the input of each channel use. Estimating the excess noise of a thermal channel is of principal interest for the security of quantum key distribution, in the setting where a fiber-optic cable has a known transmissivity but a tampering eavesdropper alters the excess noise on the channel, so that estimating the excess noise as precisely as possible is desirable. Finally, we outline a practical strategy which can be used to achieve these limits."

The device-independent approach exploits the fact that certain non-local correlations can be uniquely achieved by measurements on a particular quantum state. We can think of these correlations as a ""classical fingerprint"" of the self-tested quantum state. In this work, we show that all pure bipartite entangled states can be self-tested, by providing explicit self-testing correlations for each."

We follow Belkale's geometric method, but assume only basic representation theory and algebraic geometry, aiming for self-contained, concrete proofs. In particular, we do not assume the Littlewood-Richardson rule nor an a priori relation between intersections of Schubert cells and tensor product invariants. Our motivation is largely pedagogical, but the desire for concrete approaches is also motivated by current research in computational complexity theory and effective algorithms."

Compressed sensing, a machinery derived from the theory of signal processing, has emerged as a feasible tool to perform robust and significantly more resource-economical quantum state tomography for intermediate-sized quantum systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of compressed sensing tomography in the regime in which tomographically complete data is available with reliable statistics from experimental observations of a multi-mode photonic architecture. Due to the fact that the data is known with high statistical significance, we are in a position to systematically explore the quality of reconstruction depending on the number of employed measurement settings, randomly selected from the complete set of data, and on different model assumptions. We present and test a complete prescription to perform efficient compressed sensing and are able to reliably use notions of model selection and cross-validation to account for experimental imperfections and finite counting statistics. Thus, we establish compressed sensing as an effective tool for quantum state tomography, specifically suited for photonic systems."

This is only enhanced by recent successes in the field of classical machine learning. In this work we propose an approach for the systematic treatment of machine learning, from the perspective of quantum information. Our approach is general and covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in supervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning has received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of quantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a systematic scheme for providing improvements. As an example, we show that quadratic improvements in learning efficiency, and exponential improvements in performance over limited time periods, can be obtained for a broad class of learning problems."

Quantum information can be manipulated according to a measurement-only protocol, which is facilitated by tunable couplings between Majorana zero modes and nearby semiconductor quantum dots. Our proposed architecture designs have the following principal virtues: (1) the magnetic field can be aligned in the direction of all of the topological superconducting wires since they are all parallel; (2) topological $T$-junctions are not used, obviating possible difficulties in their fabrication and utilization; (3) quasiparticle poisoning is abated by the charging energy; (4) Clifford operations are executed by a relatively standard measurement: detection of corrections to quantum dot energy, charge, or differential capacitance induced by quantum fluctuations; (5) it is compatible with strategies for producing good approximate magic states."
1137,1610.04247,2016,10,18,14,Quantum resource theories in the single-shot regime,Gilad Gour,"One of the main goals of any resource theory such as entanglement, quantum thermodynamics, quantum coherence, and asymmetry, is to find necessary and sufficient conditions (NSC) that determine whether one resource can be converted to another by the set of free operations. Here we find such NSC for a large class of quantum resource theories which we call affine resource theories (ART). ARTs include the resource theories of athermality, asymmetry, and coherence, but not entanglement. Remarkably, the NSC can be expressed as a family of inequalities between resource monotones (quantifiers) that are given in terms of the conditional min entropy. The set of free operations is taken to be (1) the maximal set (i.e. consists of all resource non-generating (RNG) quantum channels) or (2) the self-dual set of free operations (i.e. consists of all RNG maps for which the dual map is also RNG). As an example, we apply our results to quantum thermodynamics with Gibbs preserving operations, and several other ARTs. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results to resource theories that are not affine, and along the way, provide the NSC that a quantum resource theory consists of a resource destroying map."

In the light of a theorem by Pitowski, it is generally believed that this problem is computationally intractable. In this paper, we first prove that the Euclidean distance of given correlations from the local polytope can be computed in polynomial time with arbitrary fixed error, granted the access to a certain oracle. Namely, given a fixed error, we derive two upper bounds on the running time. The first bound is linear in the number of measurements. The second bound scales as the number of measurements to the sixth power. The former is dominant only for a very high number of measurements and is never saturated in the performed numerical tests. We then introduce a simple algorithm for simulating the oracle. In all the considered numerical tests, the simulation of the oracle contributes with a multiplicative factor to the overall running time and, thus, does not affect the sixth-power law of the oracle-assisted algorithm."

Since it was shown that the Gaussian capacity of an arbitrary (phase-sensitive or insensitive) single-mode Gaussian quantum channel is equal to the Gaussian capacity of this fiducial channel, the solution presented in this work can be regarded as universal. The analytical study of this solution, below and above the energy threshold, shows that the dependence of the Gaussian capacity on the environment noise squeezing is not monotonic. In particular, the capacity may have a saddle point, one or two extrema at finite squeezing, or be a monotonically increasing function of the squeezing parameter. The exact dependence is defined by the determinant of the noise covariance matrix and by the transmissivity (or gain) of the fiducial Gaussian channel."

In contrast, only little is known about their multipartite entanglement structure, which has been of considerable recent interest. In this work, we study random stabilizer tensor networks and show that here the tripartite entanglement question has a sharp answer: The average number of GHZ triples that can be extracted from a stabilizer tensor network is small, implying that the entanglement is predominantly bipartite. As a consequence, we obtain a new operational interpretation of the monogamy of the Ryu-Takayanagi mutual information and an entropic diagnostic for higher-partite entanglement. Our technical contributions include a spin model for evaluating the average GHZ content of stabilizer tensor networks and a novel formula for the third moment of random stabilizer states."
1142,1608.02003,2016,9,15,14,How hard is deciding trivial versus nontrivial in the dihedral coset problem?,Nai-Hui Chia;Sean Hallgren,"We study the hardness of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem. It is known that lattice problems reduce to it, and that it reduces to random subset sum with density $> 1$ and also to quantum sampling subset sum solutions. We examine a decision version of the problem where the question asks whether the hidden subgroup is trivial or order two. The decision problem essentially asks if a given vector is in the span of all coset states. We approach this by first computing an explicit basis for the coset space and the perpendicular space. We then look at the consequences of having efficient unitaries that use this basis. We show that if a unitary maps the basis to the standard basis in any way, then that unitary can be used to solve random subset sum with constant density $>1$. We also show that if a unitary can exactly decide membership in the coset subspace, then the collision problem for subset sum can be solved for density $>1$ but approaching $1$ as the problem size increases. This strengthens the previous hardness result that implementing the optimal POVM in a specific way is as hard as quantum sampling subset sum solutions."
1143,1607.05141,2016,8,10,14,Rescuing Complementarity With Little Drama,Ning Bao;Adam Bouland;Aidan Chatwin-Davies;Jason Pollack;Henry Yuen,"The AMPS paradox challenges black hole complementarity by apparently constructing a way for an observer to bring information from the outside of the black hole into its interior if there is no drama at its horizon, making manifest a violation of monogamy of entanglement. We propose a new resolution to the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling observer in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the horizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition (we call it ""little drama"") which is the ""complementarity dual"" of scrambling of information on the stretched horizon. When translated to the description of the black hole interior, this implies that the fine-grained quantum information of infalling matter is rapidly diffused across the entire interior while classical observables and coarse-grained geometry remain unaffected. Under the assumption that information has diffused throughout the interior, we consider the difficulty of the information-theoretic task that an observer must perform after crossing the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole in order to verify a violation of monogamy of entanglement. We find that the time required to complete a necessary subroutine of this task, namely the decoding of Bell pairs from the interior and the late radiation, takes longer than the maximum amount of time that an observer can spend inside the black hole before hitting the singularity. Therefore, an infalling observer cannot observe monogamy violation before encountering the singularity."

We combine insights from field theory and tensor networks by constructing a Feynman path integral over a sequence of matrix product states. The paths that dominate this path integral include some degree of entanglement. This new feature allows several insights and applications: i. A Ginzburg-Landau description of deconfined phase transitions. ii. The emergence of new classical collective variables in states that are not adiabatically continuous with product states. iii. Features that are captured in product-state field theories by proliferation of instantons are encoded in perturbative fluctuations about entangled saddles. We develop a general formalism for such path integrals and a couple of simple examples to illustrate their utility."

We propose that instantiating the deformation-based surface code using superstabilizers makes it possible to detect short error chains connecting the superstabilizers, allowing us to place logical qubits close together. Additionally, we demonstrate the process of conversion from the defect-based surface code, which works as arbitrary state injection, and a lattice surgery-like CNOT gate implementation that requires fewer physical qubits than the braiding CNOT gate. Finally we propose a placement design for the deformation-based surface code and analyze its resource consumption; large scale quantum computation requires $\frac{25}{4}d^2 +5d + 1$ physical qubits per logical qubit where $d$ is the code distance, whereas the planar code requires $16d^2 -16d + 4$ physical qubits per logical qubit, for a reduction of about 55%."

A recently introduced Exact Holographic Mapping [C.H. Lee and X.-L. Qi, Phys. Rev. B 93, 035112 (2016)] uses the Haar wavelet basis to represent the free Dirac fermionic quantum field theory (QFT) at multiple renormalization scales thereby inducing an emergent bulk geometry in one higher dimension. This construction is, in fact, generic and we show how higher families of Daubechies wavelet transforms of 1+1 dimensional scalar bosonic QFT generate a bulk description with a variable rate of renormalization flow. In the massless case, where the boundary is described by conformal field theory, the bulk correlations decay with distance consistent with an Anti-de-Sitter space (AdS3) metric whose radius of curvature depends on the wavelet family used. We propose an experimental demonstration of the bulk/boundary correspondence via a digital quantum simulation using Gaussian operations on a set of quantum harmonic oscillator modes."
1147,1605.04922,2016,6,21,14,Capacities of Quantum Amplifier Channels,Haoyu Qi;Mark M Wilde,"Quantum amplifier channels are at the core of several physical processes in nature. Not only do they model the optical process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but the Bogoliubov transformation corresponding to an amplifier channel also describes the physics of the dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting circuits, the Unruh effect, and Hawking radiation. Here we study the communication capabilities of quantum amplifier channels. Invoking a recently established minimum output entropy theorem for single-mode phase-insensitive Gaussian channels [Qi, Wilde, Guha, arXiv:1607.05262], we determine capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels in three different scenarios. First, we establish the capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels for one of the most general communication tasks, characterized by the trade-off between classical communication, quantum communication, and entanglement generation or consumption. Second, we establish capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels for the trade-off between public classical communication, private classical communication, and secret key generation. In these settings, we discuss how the capacities with trade-off encoding significantly outperform those achieved with a naive time sharing strategy. Third, we determine the capacity region for a single-sender, two-receiver broadcast channel induced by a unitary dilation of the quantum-limited amplifier channel, and we also show that a fully quantum strategy outperforms those achieved by classical coherent detection strategies. In all three scenarios we find that the capacities decrease with increasing amplifier gain, due to unavoidable quantum-mechanical amplification noise."

However, computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical computational methods. In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum simulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and efficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic physics experiments, the long-term vision being the extension to real-time quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories."
1149,1605.02821,2016,6,15,14,Finite-Block-Length Analysis in Classical and Quantum Information Theory,Masahito Hayashi,"This is a review article of finite-block-length analysis in classical and quantum information theory for non-specialist. Transmitting an information is a fundamental technology. However, there are several demands for this transmission. The research area to study such problems is called information theory. In the information transmission, the information is transmitted via a physical media. Hence, the analysis of this problem might depends on the property of the physical media. Indeed, while it is ideal that the analysis does not depend on this property, it depends on the following classification of the physical media. Currently, we have two kinds of physical objects, the first one is a macroscopic object, i.e., an object subject to classical physics, and the second one is a microscopic object, i.e., an object subject to quantum physics. Since these two objects have completely different behaviors, we need to build up information theory dependently of these two information media. That is, we have classical information theory and quantum information theory. In both information theory, there are very elegant theoretical results with an ideal assumption. That is, we often assume that infinitely large size of the system is available while the real situation does not satisfy this assumption. Hence, to discuss the real case, we need to care about the finite size effect of the system size. This paper reviews this finite size effect in classical and quantum information theory with respect to various topics."
1150,1605.02078,2016,5,18,14,Non-Shannon inequalities in the entropy vector approach to causal structures,Mirjam Weilenmann;Roger Colbeck,"A causal structure is a relationship between observed variables that in general restricts the set of possible correlations between them. This relationship can be mediated by unobserved systems, which correspond to random variables in the classical case and shared density operators in the quantum case. Here we investigate the use of entropy vectors - vectors whose components correspond to the entropies of each subset of the observed variables - as a means to differentiate between the classical and quantum cases of particular causal structures. We use non-Shannon entropic inequalities to give additional constraints on the sets of possible entropy vectors in the classical case and hence obtain tighter outer approximations of the set of realisable entropy vectors. We also discuss how to obtain inner approximations. We provide several examples and analyse the triangle causal structure in detail. In most causal structures where it is unknown whether or not there is a classical-quantum separation in terms of entropy vectors, non-Shannon inequalities give a tighter characterisation in the classical case. The question of whether these improved characterisations also hold in the quantum case remains open, i.e., we remain without an example of an entropy vector that is attainable in a quantum causal structure, but not in the classical analogue. These techniques may also shed light on the question of whether non-Shannon inequalities also hold for the von Neumann entropy."
1151,1604.06101,2016,5,17,14,Spurious Long-range Entanglement and Replica Correlation Length,Liujun Zou;Jeongwan Haah,"Topological entanglement entropy has been regarded as a smoking-gun signature of topological order in two dimensions, capturing the total quantum dimension of the topological particle content. An extrapolation method on cylinders has been used frequently to measure the topological entanglement entropy. Here, we show that a class of short-range entangled 2D states, when put on an infinite cylinder of circumference $L$, exhibits the entanglement Rényi entropy of any integer index $\alpha \ge 2$ that obeys $S_\alpha = a L - \gamma$ where $a, \gamma > 0 $. Under the extrapolation method, the subleading term $\gamma$ would be identified as the topological entanglement entropy, which is spurious. A nonzero $\gamma$ is always present if the 2D state reduces to a certain symmetry-protected topological 1D state, upon disentangling spins that are far from the entanglement cut. The internal symmetry that stabilizes $\gamma > 0$ is not necessarily a symmetry of the 2D state, but should be present after the disentangling reduction. If the symmetry is absent, $\gamma$ decays exponentially in $L$ with a characteristic length, termed as a replica correlation length, which can be arbitrarily large compared to the two-point correlation length of the 2D state. We propose a simple numerical procedure to measure the replica correlation length through replica correlation functions. We also calculate the replica correlation functions for representative wave functions of abelian discrete gauge theories and the double semion theory in 2D, to show that they decay abruptly to zero. This supports a conjecture that the replica correlation length being small implies that the subleading term from the extrapolation method determines the total quantum dimension."
1152,1604.03185,2016,5,11,14,Thermodynamics of quantum systems programmed by classical circuitry,Varun Narasimhachar;Gilad Gour,"The ""thermal operations"" (TO) framework developed in past works is used to model the evolution of microscopic quantum systems in contact with thermal baths. Here we extend the TO model to describe hybrid devices consisting of quantum systems controlled by macroscopic or otherwise classical elements external to the system-bath setup. We define the operations of such hybrid devices as conditioned thermal operations (CTO), and their deviation from thermal equilibrium as conditional athermality. We develop the resource theory of conditional athermality, including its characterization, quantification, and manipulation. We find that our formalism unifies those of thermo-majorization (M. Horodecki and J. Oppenheim, Nat. Commun. 4, 2013) and conditional majorization (G. Gour et al., arXiv:1506.07124, 2015). After introducing conditional athermality monotones, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for single-copy resource conversion, as well as the asymptotic rate of many-copy conversion. As an application, we derive the conditions for probabilistic conversion of athermality, and find them to be analogous to results on stochastic entanglement manipulation (D. Jonathan and M. Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1455, 1999; G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1046, 1999)."
1153,1604.03089,2016,5,10,14,Different quantum f-divergences and the reversibility of quantum operations,Fumio Hiai;Milán Mosonyi,"The concept of classical $f$-divergences gives a unified framework to construct and study measures of dissimilarity of probability distributions; special cases include the relative entropy and the Rényi divergences. Various quantum versions of this concept, and more narrowly, the concept of Rényi divergences, have been introduced in the literature with applications in quantum information theory; most notably Petz' quasi-entropies (standard $f$-divergences), Matsumoto's maximal $f$-divergences, measured $f$-divergences, and sandwiched and $\alpha$-$z$-Rényi divergences. In this paper we give a systematic overview of the various concepts of quantum $f$-divergences with a main focus on their monotonicity under quantum operations, and the implications of the preservation of a quantum $f$-divergence by a quantum operation. In particular, we compare the standard and the maximal $f$-divergences regarding their ability to detect the reversibility of quantum operations. We also show that these two quantum $f$-divergences are strictly different for non-commuting operators unless $f$ is a polynomial, and obtain some analogous partial results for the relation between the measured and the standard $f$-divergences. We also study the monotonicity of the $\alpha$-$z$-Rényi divergences under the special class of bistochastic maps that leave one of the arguments of the Rényi divergence invariant, and determine domains of the parameters $\alpha,z$ where monotonicity holds, and where the preservation of the $\alpha$-$z$-Rényi divergence implies the reversibility of the quantum operation."
1154,1604.00382,2016,4,22,14,Measurement Uncertainty for Finite Quantum Observables,René Schwonnek;David Reeb;Reinhard F Werner,"Measurement uncertainty relations are lower bounds on the errors of any approximate joint measurement of two or more quantum observables. The aim of this paper is to provide methods to compute optimal bounds of this type. The basic method is semidefinite programming, which we apply to arbitrary finite collections of projective observables on a finite dimensional Hilbert space. The quantification of errors is based on an arbitrary cost function, which assigns a penalty to getting result $x$ rather than y, for any pair (x,y). This induces a notion of optimal transport cost for a pair of probability distributions, and we include an appendix with a short summary of optimal transport theory as needed in our context. There are then different ways to form an overall figure of merit from the comparison of distributions. We consider three, which are related to different physical testing scenarios. The most thorough test compares the transport distances between the marginals of a joint measurement and the reference observables for every input state. Less demanding is a test just on the states for which a ""true value"" is known in the sense that the reference observable yields a definite outcome. Finally, we can measure a deviation as a single expectation value by comparing the two observables on the two parts of a maximally entangled state. All three error quantities have the property that they vanish if and only if the tested observable is equal to the reference. The theory is illustrated with some characteristic examples."
1155,1603.05423,2016,4,13,14,Irreconcilable Difference Between Quantum Walks and Adiabatic Quantum Computing,Thomas G Wong;David A Meyer,"Continuous-time quantum walks and adiabatic quantum evolution are two general techniques for quantum computing, both of which are described by Hamiltonians that govern their evolutions by Schrödinger's equation. In the former, the Hamiltonian is fixed, while in the latter, the Hamiltonian varies with time. As a result, their formulations of Grover's algorithm evolve differently through Hilbert space. We show that this difference is fundamental; they cannot be made to evolve along each other's path without introducing structure more powerful than the standard oracle for unstructured search. For an adiabatic quantum evolution to evolve like the quantum walk search algorithm, it must interpolate between three fixed Hamiltonians, one of which is complex and introduces structure that is stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Conversely, for a quantum walk to evolve along the path of the adiabatic search algorithm, it must be a chiral quantum walk on a weighted, directed star graph with structure that is also stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Thus the two techniques, although similar in being described by Hamiltonians that govern their evolution, compute by fundamentally irreconcilable means."
1156,1603.02553,2016,4,12,14,Inability of the entropy vector method to certify nonclassicality in linelike causal structures,Mirjam Weilenmann;Roger Colbeck,"Bell's theorem shows that our intuitive understanding of causation must be overturned in light of quantum correlations. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics does not permit signalling and hence a notion of cause remains. Understanding this notion is not only important at a fundamental level, but also for technological applications such as key distribution and randomness expansion. It has recently been shown that a useful way to decide which classical causal structures could give rise to a given set of correlations is to use entropy vectors. These are vectors whose components are the entropies of all subsets of the observed variables in the causal structure. The entropy vector method employs causal relationships among the variables to restrict the set of possible entropy vectors. Here, we consider whether the same approach can lead to useful certificates of non-classicality within a given causal structure. Surprisingly, we find that for a family of causal structures that include the usual bipartite Bell structure they do not. For all members of this family, no function of the entropies of the observed variables gives such a certificate, in spite of the existence of nonclassical correlations. It is therefore necessary to look beyond entropy vectors to understand cause from a quantum perspective."
1157,1603.02242,2016,4,4,14,Single-Mode Displacement Sensor,Kasper Duivenvoorden;Barbara M Terhal;Daniel Weigand,"We show that one can determine both parameters of a displacement acting on an oscillator with an accuracy which scales inversely with the square root of the number of photons in the oscillator. Our results are obtained by using a grid state as a sensor state for detecting small translations in phase space (displacements). Grid states were first proposed in (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.012310 ) for encoding a qubit into an oscillator: an efficient preparation protocol of such states, using a coupling to a qubit, was developed in (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315 ). We compare the performance of the grid state with the quantum compass or cat code state and place our results in the context of the two-parameter quantum Cramér-Rao lower bound on the variances of the displacement parameters. We show that the accessible information about the displacement for a grid state increases with the number of photons in the state when we measure and prepare the state using a phase estimation protocol. This is in contrast with the accessible information in the quantum compass state which we show is always upper bounded by a constant, independent of the number of photons. We present numerical simulations of a phase estimation based preparation protocol of a grid state in the presence of photon loss, nonlinearities and qubit measurement, using no post-selection, showing how the two effective squeezing parameters which characterize the grid state change during the preparation. The idea behind the phase estimation protocol is a simple maximal-information gain strategy."

We argue for a general correspondence between such phases and topological phases of undriven systems protected by symmetry $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes G$, where the additional $\mathbb{Z}$ accounts for the discrete time translation symmetry. Thus, for example, the bosonic phases in $d$ spatial dimensions without intrinsic topological order (SPT phases) are classified by the cohomology group $H^{d+1}(\mathbb{Z} \rtimes G, \mathrm{U}(1))$. For unitary symmetries, we interpret the additional resulting Floquet phases in terms of the lower-dimensional SPT phases that are pumped to the boundary during one time step. These results also imply the existence of novel symmetry-enriched topological (SET) orders protected solely by the periodicity of the drive."

Traditional methods are impractical for even medium sized systems and are not robust against noise and errors. Here we report on an experimental demonstration of self-guided quantum tomography; an autonomous, fast, robust and precise technique for measuring quantum states with significantly less computational resources than standard techniques. The quantum state is iteratively learned by treating tomography as a projection measurement optimization problem. We experimentally demonstrate robustness against both statistical noise and experimental errors on both single qubit and entangled two-qubit states. Our demonstration provides a method of full quantum state characterization in current and near-future experiments where standard techniques are unfeasible."

Here the robustness of coherence is defined and proven a full monotone in the context of the recently introduced resource theories of quantum coherence. The measure is shown to be observable, as it can be recast as the expectation value of a coherence witness operator for any quantum state. The robustness of coherence is evaluated analytically on relevant classes of states, and an efficient semidefinite program that computes it on general states is given. An operational interpretation is finally provided: the robustness of coherence quantifies the advantage enabled by a quantum state in a phase-discrimination task."
1161,1512.07081,2015,2,16,14,On tensor products of CSS Codes,Benjamin Audoux;Alain Couvreur,"CSS codes are in one-to-one correspondance with length 3 chain complexes. The latter are naturally endowed with a tensor product $\otimes$ which induces a similar operation on the former. We investigate this operation, and in particular its behavior with regard to minimum distances. Given a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$, we give a criterion which provides a lower bound on the minimum distance of $\mathcal{C} \otimes \mathcal{D}$ for every CSS code $\mathcal D$. We apply this result to study the behaviour of iterated tensor powers of codes. Such sequences of codes are logarithmically LDPC and we prove in particular that their minimum distances tend generically to infinity. Different known results are reinterpretated in terms of tensor products. Three new families of CSS codes are defined, and their iterated tensor powers produce LDPC sequences of codes with length $n$, row weight in $O(\log n)$ and minimum distances larger than $n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ for any $\alpha<1$. One family produces sequences with dimensions larger than $n^\beta$ for any $\beta<1$."

This provides an operational interpretation to a natural extension of Le Cam's deficiency to quantum channels. In particular, we obtain a version of the randomization criterion for quantum statistical experiments. The proofs are based on some properties of the diamond norm and its dual, which are of independent interest."
1163,1512.04528,2015,1,18,14,Exponential Lifetime Improvement in Topological Quantum Memories,Charles-Edouard Bardyn;Torsten Karzig,"We propose a simple yet efficient mechanism for passive error correction in topological quantum memories. Our scheme relies on driven-dissipative ancilla systems which couple to local excitations (anyons) and make them ""sink"" in energy, with no required interaction among ancillae or anyons. Through this process, anyons created by some thermal environment end up trapped in potential ""trenches"" that they themselves generate, which can be interpreted as a ""memory foam"" for anyons. This self-trapping mechanism provides an energy barrier for anyon propagation, and removes entropy from the memory by favoring anyon recombination over anyon separation (responsible for memory errors). We demonstrate that our scheme leads to an exponential increase of the memory-coherence time with system size $L$, up to an upper bound $L_\mathrm{max}$ which can increase exponentially with $\Delta/T$, where $T$ is the temperature and $\Delta$ is some energy scale defined by potential trenches. This results in a double exponential increase of the memory time with $\Delta/T$, which greatly improves over the Arrhenius (single-exponential) scaling found in typical quantum memories."
1164,1512.02240,2015,12,23,14,Causal Boxes: Quantum Information-Processing Systems Closed under Composition,Christopher Portmann;Christian Matt;Ueli Maurer;Renato Renner;Björn Tackmann,"Complex information-processing systems, for example quantum circuits, cryptographic protocols, or multi-player games, are naturally described as networks composed of more basic information-processing systems. A modular analysis of such systems requires a mathematical model of systems that is closed under composition, i.e., a network of these objects is again an object of the same type. We propose such a model and call the corresponding systems causal boxes. Causal boxes capture superpositions of causal structures, e.g., messages sent by a causal box A can be in a superposition of different orders or in a superposition of being sent to box B and box C. Furthermore, causal boxes can model systems whose behavior depends on time. By instantiating the Abstract Cryptography framework with causal boxes, we obtain the first composable security framework that can handle arbitrary quantum protocols and relativistic protocols."

First, we consider classical source coding with quantum side-information where the quantum side-information is observed by a helper and sent to the decoder via a classical channel. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate region for this problem. The direct part of our result is proved via the measurement compression theory by Winter, a quantum to classical channel simulation. Our result reveals that a helper's scheme that separately conducts a measurement and a compression is suboptimal, and the measurement compression is fundamentally needed to achieve the optimal rate region. We then study coded source compression in the fully quantum regime. We characterise the quantum resources involved in this problem, and derive a single-letter expression of the achievable rate region when entanglement assistance is available. The direct coding proof is based on a combination of two fundamental protocols, namely the quantum state merging protocol and the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. Our work hence resolves coded source compression in the quantum regime."
1166,1511.01997,2015,12,16,14,Non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians for quantum error suppression,Zhang Jiang;Eleanor G Rieffel,"Physical constraints make it challenging to implement and control multi-body interactions. For this reason, designing quantum information processes with Hamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile challenge. A common approach to robust storage of quantum information is to encode it in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian. Even allowing particles with high Hilbert-space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information from single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian containing only commuting two-local terms. Here, we demonstrate how to get around this no-go result by encoding in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian consisting of non-commuting two-local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem code. Specifically, we show how to protect stored quantum information against single-qubit errors using a Hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge generators from Bacon-Shor codes and generalized-Bacon-Shor code. Our results imply that non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians have more error-suppressing power than commuting two-local Hamiltonians. Finally, we comment briefly on the robustness of the whole scheme."
1167,1510.06474,2015,12,9,14,"Quantum speed limits, coherence and asymmetry",Iman Marvian;Robert W Spekkens;Paolo Zanardi,"The resource theory of asymmetry is a framework for classifying and quantifying the symmetry-breaking properties of both states and operations relative to a given symmetry. In the special case where the symmetry is the set of translations generated by a fixed observable, asymmetry can be interpreted as coherence relative to the observable eigenbasis, and the resource theory of asymmetry provides a framework to study this notion of coherence. We here show that this notion of coherence naturally arises in the context of quantum speed limits. Indeed, the very concept of speed of evolution, i.e., the inverse of the minimum time it takes the system to evolve to another (partially) distinguishable state, is a measure of asymmetry relative to the time translations generated by the system Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the celebrated Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin speed limits can be interpreted as upper bounds on this measure of asymmetry by functions which are themselves measures of asymmetry in the special case of pure states. Using measures of asymmetry that are not restricted to pure states, such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information, we obtain extensions of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound which are significantly tighter in the case of mixed states. We also clarify some confusions in the literature about coherence and asymmetry, and show that measures of coherence are a proper subset of measures of asymmetry."
1168,1510.03695,2015,11,20,14,Relative submajorization and its use in quantum resource theories,Joseph M Renes,"We introduce and study a generalization of majorization called relative submajorization and show that it has many applications to the resource theories of thermodynamics, bipartite entanglement, and quantum coherence. In particular, we show that relative submajorization characterizes both the probability and approximation error that can be obtained when transforming one resource to another, also when assisted by additional standard resources such as useful work or maximally-entangled states. These characterizations have a geometric formulation as the ratios or differences, respectively, between the Lorenz curves associated with the input and output resources. We also find several interesting bounds on the reversibility of a given transformation in terms of the properties of the forward transformation. The main technical tool used to establish these results is linear programming duality."
1169,1509.07484,2015,11,9,14,Algorithms for tensor network renormalization,Glen Evenbly,"We discuss in detail algorithms for implementing tensor network renormalization (TNR) for the study of classical statistical and quantum many-body systems. Firstly, we recall established techniques for how the partition function of a 2D classical many-body system or the Euclidean path integral of a 1D quantum system can be represented as a network of tensors, before describing how TNR can be implemented to efficiently contract the network via a sequence of coarse-graining transformations. The efficacy of the TNR approach is then benchmarked for the 2D classical statistical and 1D quantum Ising models; in particular the ability of TNR to maintain a high level of accuracy over sustained coarse-graining transformations, even at a critical point, is demonstrated."

Type I interpretations see quantum probabilities as determined by intrinsic properties of the observed system. Type II see them as relational experiences between an observer and the system. It is usually believed that a decision between these two options cannot be made simply on purely physical grounds but requires an act of metaphysical judgment. Here we show that, under some assumptions, the problem is decidable using thermodynamics. We prove that type I interpretations are incompatible with the following assumptions: (i) The choice of which measurement is performed can be made randomly and independently of the system under observation, (ii) the system has limited memory, and (iii) Landauer's erasure principle holds."

Record-size, but non-universal, continuous-variable cluster states were recently demonstrated separately in the time and frequency domains. We propose to combine these approaches into a scalable architecture in which a single optical parametric oscillator and simple interferometer entangle up to ($3\times 10^3$ frequencies) $\times$ (unlimited number of temporal modes) into a new and computationally universal continuous-variable cluster state. We introduce a generalized measurement protocol to enable improved computational performance on this new entanglement resource."
1172,1508.06474,2015,9,25,14,The Degree of Quantum Correlation Required to Speed-Up a Computation,Alastair Kay,"The one clean qubit model of quantum computation (DQC1) efficiently implements a computational task that is not known to have a classical alternative. During the computation, there is never more than a small but finite amount of entanglement present, and it is typically vanishingly small in the system size. In this paper, we demonstrate that there is nothing unexpected hidden within the DQC1 model -- Grover's Search, when acting on a mixed state, provably exhibits a speed-up over classical with guarantees as to the presence of only vanishingly small amounts of quantum correlations (entanglement and quantum discord) -- while arguing that this is not an artefact of the oracle-based construction. We also present some important refinements in the evaluation of how much entanglement may be present in DQC1, and how the typical entanglement of the system must be evaluated."
1173,1508.03468,2015,9,3,14,Topological phases with generalized global symmetries,Beni Yoshida,"We present simple lattice realizations of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with $q$-form global symmetries where charged excitations have $q$ spatial dimensions. Specifically, we construct $d$ space-dimensional models supported on a $(d+1)$-colorable graph by using a family of unitary phase gates, known as multi-qubit control-$Z$ gates in quantum information community. In our construction, charged excitations of different dimensionality may coexist and form a short-range entangled state which is protected by symmetry operators of different dimensionality. Non-triviality of proposed models, in a sense of quantum circuit complexity, is confirmed by studying protected boundary modes, gauged models and corresponding gapped domain walls. We also comment on applications of our construction to quantum error-correcting codes, and discuss corresponding fault-tolerant logical gates."
1174,1508.02720,2015,8,27,14,Quasi-autonomous quantum thermal machines and quantum to classical energy flow,Max F Frenzel;David Jennings;Terry G Rudolph,"There are both practical and foundational motivations to consider the thermodynamics of quantum systems at small scales. Here we address the issue of autonomous quantum thermal machines that are tailored to achieve some specific thermodynamic primitive, such as work extraction in the presence of a thermal environment, while having minimal or no control from the macroscopic regime. Beyond experimental implementations, this provides an arena in which to address certain foundational aspects such as the role of coherence in thermodynamics, the use of clock degrees of freedom and the simulation of local time-dependent Hamiltonians in a particular quantum subsystem. For small-scale systems additional issues arise. Firstly, it is not clear to what degree genuine ordered thermodynamic work has been extracted, and secondly non-trivial back-actions on the thermal machine must be accounted for. We find that both these aspects can be resolved through a judicious choice of quantum measurements that magnify thermodynamic properties up the ladder of length-scales, while simultaneously stabilizing the quantum thermal machine. Within this framework we show that thermodynamic reversibility is obtained in a particular Zeno limit, and finally illustrate these concepts with a concrete example involving spin-systems."
1175,1507.08482,2015,8,17,14,Framework for learning agents in quantum environments,Vedran Dunjko;Jacob M Taylor;Hans J Briegel,"In this paper we provide a broad framework for describing learning agents in general quantum environments. We analyze the types of classically specified environments which allow for quantum enhancements in learning, by contrasting environments to quantum oracles. We show that whether or not quantum improvements are at all possible depends on the internal structure of the quantum environment. If the environments are constructed and the internal structure is appropriately chosen, or if the agent has limited capacities to influence the internal states of the environment, we show that improvements in learning times are possible in a broad range of scenarios. Such scenarios we call luck-favoring settings. The case of constructed environments is particularly relevant for the class of model-based learning agents, where our results imply a near-generic improvement."
1176,1507.05123,2015,8,13,14,Distinguishability of generic quantum states,Zbigniew Puchała;Łukasz Pawela;Karol Życzkowski,"Properties of random mixed states of order $N$ distributed uniformly with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure are investigated. We show that for large $N$, due to the concentration of measure, the trace distance between two random states tends to a fixed number ${\tilde D}=1/4+1/\pi$, which yields the Helstrom bound on their distinguishability. To arrive at this result we apply free random calculus and derive the symmetrized Marchenko--Pastur distribution, which is shown to describe numerical data for the model of two coupled quantum kicked tops. Asymptotic values for the fidelity, Bures and transmission distances between two random states are obtained. Analogous results for quantum relative entropy and Chernoff quantity provide other bounds on the distinguishablity of both states in a multiple measurement setup due to the quantum Sanov theorem."
1177,1507.01625,2015,8,12,14,Classical Cryptographic Protocols in a Quantum World,Sean Hallgren;Adam Smith;Fang Song,"Cryptographic protocols, such as protocols for secure function evaluation (SFE), have played a crucial role in the development of modern cryptography. The extensive theory of these protocols, however, deals almost exclusively with classical attackers. If we accept that quantum information processing is the most realistic model of physically feasible computation, then we must ask: what classical protocols remain secure against quantum attackers? Our main contribution is showing the existence of classical two-party protocols for the secure evaluation of any polynomial-time function under reasonable computational assumptions (for example, it suffices that the learning with errors problem be hard for quantum polynomial time). Our result shows that the basic two-party feasibility picture from classical cryptography remains unchanged in a quantum world."
1178,1506.07429,2015,7,31,14,Deciding the existence of perfect entangled strategies for nonlocal games,Laura Mančinska;David E Roberson;Antonios Varvitsiotis,"First, we consider the problem of deciding whether a nonlocal game admits a perfect entangled strategy that uses projective measurements on a maximally entangled shared state. Via a polynomial-time Karp reduction, we show that independent set games are the hardest instances of this problem. Secondly, we show that if every independent set game whose entangled value is equal to one admits a perfect entangled strategy, then the same holds for all symmetric synchronous games. Finally, we identify combinatorial lower bounds on the classical and entangled values of synchronous games in terms of variants of the independence number of appropriate graphs. Our results suggest that independent set games might be representative of all nonlocal games when dealing with questions concerning perfect entangled strategies."
1179,1506.06377,2015,7,21,14,Measures of quantum correlations in infinite-dimensional systems,M E Shirokov,"Several important measures of quantum correlations of a state of a finite-dimensional composite system are defined as linear combinations of marginal entropies of this state. This paper is devoted to the infinite-dimensional generalizations of such quantities and to the analysis of their properties. We introduce the notion of faithful extension of a linear combination of marginal entropies and consider several concrete examples starting with the quantum mutual information and the quantum conditional entropy. Then we show that the conditional mutual information can be uniquely defined as a lower semicontinuous function on the set of all states of a tripartite infinite-dimensional system possessing all the basic properties valid in finite dimensions. Infinite-dimensional generalizations of some other measures of quantum correlations in multipartite quantum systems are also considered. It is shown that almost all of these generalized measures are globally lower semicontinuous and possess local continuity properties which essentially simplify their use in analysis of quantum systems. In the second part of the paper we consider applications of the general results of its first part, in particular, to the theory of infinite-dimensional quantum channels and their capacities. We also show the existence of the Fawzi-Renner recovery channel reproducing marginal states for all tripartite states (including states with infinite marginal entropies) starting with the corresponding finite-dimensional result."
1180,1506.04999,2015,7,8,14,Achieving the Holevo bound via a bisection decoding protocol,Matteo Rosati;Vittorio Giovannetti,"We present a new decoding protocol to realize transmission of classical information through a quantum channel at asymptotically maximum capacity, achieving the Holevo bound and thus the optimal communication rate. At variance with previous proposals, our scheme recovers the message bit by bit, making use of a series ""yes-no"" measurements, organized in bisection fashion, thus determining which codeword was sent in log(N) steps, N being the number of codewords."
1181,1505.07802,2015,6,25,14,Device-Independent Tests of Entropy,Rafael Chaves;Jonatan Bohr Brask;Nicolas Brunner,"We show that the entropy of a message can be tested in a device-independent way. Specifically, we consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with classical or quantum communication, and develop two different methods for placing lower bounds on the communication entropy, given observable data. The first method is based on the framework of causal inference networks. The second technique, based on convex optimization, shows that quantum communication provides an advantage over classical, in the sense of requiring a lower entropy to reproduce given data. These ideas may serve as a basis for novel applications in device-independent quantum information processing."
1182,1505.03712,2015,6,23,14,Majorana braiding with thermal noise,Fabio L Pedrocchi;David P DiVincenzo,"We investigate the self-correcting properties of a network of Majorana wires, in the form of a trijunction, in contact with a parity-preserving thermal environment. As opposed to the case where Majorana bound states (MBSs) are immobile, braiding MBSs within a trijunction introduces dangerous error processes that we identify. Such errors prevent the lifetime of the memory from increasing with the size of the system. We confirm our predictions with Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings put a restriction on the degree of self-correction of this specific quantum computing architecture."
1183,1505.00113,2015,6,17,14,The quantum complexity of approximating the frequency moments,Ashley Montanaro,"The $k$'th frequency moment of a sequence of integers is defined as $F_k = \sum_j n_j^k$, where $n_j$ is the number of times that $j$ occurs in the sequence. Here we study the quantum complexity of approximately computing the frequency moments in two settings. In the query complexity setting, we wish to minimise the number of queries to the input used to approximate $F_k$ up to relative error $\epsilon$. We give quantum algorithms which outperform the best possible classical algorithms up to quadratically. In the multiple-pass streaming setting, we see the elements of the input one at a time, and seek to minimise the amount of storage space, or passes over the data, used to approximate $F_k$. We describe quantum algorithms for $F_0$, $F_2$ and $F_\infty$ in this model which substantially outperform the best possible classical algorithms in certain parameter regimes."
1184,1504.05911,2015,5,29,14,Simulations of closed timelike curves,Todd A Brun;Mark M Wilde,"Proposed models of closed timelike curves (CTCs) have been shown to enable powerful information-processing protocols. We examine the simulation of models of CTCs both by other models of CTCs and by physical systems without access to CTCs. We prove that the recently proposed transition probability CTCs (T-CTCs) are physically equivalent to postselection CTCs (P-CTCs), in the sense that one model can simulate the other with reasonable overhead. As a consequence, their information-processing capabilities are equivalent. We also describe a method for quantum computers to simulate Deutschian CTCs (but with a reasonable overhead only in some cases). In cases for which the overhead is reasonable, it might be possible to perform the simulation in a table-top experiment. This approach has the benefit of resolving some ambiguities associated with the equivalent circuit model of Ralph et al. Furthermore, we provide an explicit form for the state of the CTC system such that it is a maximum-entropy state, as prescribed by Deutsch."
1185,1504.05255,2015,5,15,14,Semantic Security and Indistinguishability in the Quantum World,Tommaso Gagliardoni;Andreas Hülsing;Christian Schaffner,"At CRYPTO 2013, Boneh and Zhandry initiated the study of quantum-secure encryption. They proposed first indistinguishability definitions for the quantum world where the actual indistinguishability only holds for classical messages, and they provide arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger notion. In this work, we show that stronger notions are achievable, where the indistinguishability holds for quantum superpositions of messages. We investigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining such a quantum indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key encryption schemes. We justify our stronger definition by showing its equivalence to novel quantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we show that our new security definitions cannot be achieved by a large class of ciphers -- those which are quasi-preserving the message length. On the other hand, we provide a secure construction based on quantum-resistant pseudorandom permutations; this construction can be used as a generic transformation for turning a large class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and hence quantum semantically secure ones. Moreover, our construction is the first completely classical encryption scheme shown to be secure against an even stronger notion of indistinguishability, which was previously known to be achievable only by using quantum messages and arbitrary quantum encryption circuits."
1186,1503.05342,2015,5,4,14,Beyond Complete Positivity,Jason M Dominy;Daniel A Lidar,"We provide a general and consistent formulation for linear subsystem quantum dynamical maps, developed from a minimal set of postulates, primary among which is a relaxation of the usual, restrictive assumption of uncorrelated initial system-bath states. We describe the space of possibilities admitted by this formulation, namely that, far from being limited to only completely positive (CP) maps, essentially any $\mathbb{C}$-linear, Hermiticity-preserving, trace-preserving subsystem map can arise as a legitimate subsystem dynamical map from a joint unitary evolution of a system coupled to a bath. The price paid for this added generality is a trade-off between the set of admissible initial states and the allowed set of joint system-bath unitary evolutions. As an application we present a simple example of a non-CP map constructed as a subsystem dynamical map that violates some fundamental inequalities in quantum information theory, such as the quantum data processing inequality."
1187,1503.02312,2015,4,23,14,Quantum Simulations of Lattice Gauge Theories using Ultracold Atoms in Optical Lattices,Erez Zohar;J Ignacio Cirac;Benni Reznik,"Can high energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems, such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles. However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure atomic system to manifest both local gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance. In particular, local gauge invariance can arise either as an effective, low energy, symmetry, or as an ""exact"" symmetry, following from the conservation laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators may lead to new type of (table-top) experiments, that shall be used to study various QCD phenomena, as the confinement of dynamical quarks, phase transitions, and other effects, which are inaccessible using the currently known computational methods. In this report, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories, and then describe our recent progress in constructing quantum simulation of Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices."
1188,1502.05330,2015,4,22,14,Local reversibility and entanglement structure of many-body ground states,Tomotaka Kuwahara;Itai Arad;Luigi Amico;Vlatko Vedral,"The low-temperature physics of quantum many-body systems is largely governed by the structure of their ground states. Minimizing the energy of local interactions, ground states often reflect strong properties of locality such as the area law for entanglement entropy and the exponential decay of correlations between spatially separated observables. In this letter we present a novel characterization of locality in quantum states, which we call `local reversibility'. It characterizes the type of operations that are needed to reverse the action of a general disturbance on the state. We prove that unique ground states of gapped local Hamiltonian are locally reversible. This way, we identify new fundamental features of many-body ground states, which cannot be derived from the aforementioned properties. We use local reversibility to distinguish between states enjoying microscopic and macroscopic quantum phenomena. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we prove specific properties of ground states, which are relevant both to critical and non-critical theories."
1189,1502.01663,2015,3,19,14,Probing for quantum speedup in spin glass problems with planted solutions,Itay Hen;Joshua Job;Tameem Albash;Troels F Rønnow;Matthias Troyer;Daniel A Lidar,"The availability of quantum annealing devices with hundreds of qubits has made the experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup for optimization problems a coveted, albeit elusive goal. Going beyond earlier studies of random Ising problems, here we introduce a method to construct a set of frustrated Ising-model optimization problems with tunable hardness. We study the performance of a D-Wave Two device (DW2) with up to 503 qubits on these problems and compare it to a suite of classical algorithms, including a highly optimized algorithm designed to compete directly with the DW2. The problems are generated around predetermined ground-state configurations, called planted solutions, which makes them particularly suitable for benchmarking purposes. The problem set exhibits properties familiar from constraint satisfaction (SAT) problems, such as a peak in the typical hardness of the problems, determined by a tunable clause density parameter. We bound the hardness regime where the DW2 device either does not or might exhibit a quantum speedup for our problem set. While we do not find evidence for a speedup for the hardest and most frustrated problems in our problem set, we cannot rule out that a speedup might exist for some of the easier, less frustrated problems. Our empirical findings pertain to the specific D-Wave processor and problem set we studied and leave open the possibility that future processors might exhibit a quantum speedup on the same problem set."
1190,1501.07779,2015,3,10,14,A family of stabilizer codes for $D({\mathbb Z}_2)$ anyons and Majorana modes,James R Wootton,"We study and generalize the class of qubit topological stabilizer codes that arise in the Abelian phase of the honeycomb lattice model. The resulting family of codes, which we call `matching codes' realize the same anyon model as the surface codes, and so may be similarly used in proposals for quantum computation. We show that these codes are particularly well suited to engineering twist defects that behave as Majorana modes. A proof of principle system that demonstrates the braiding properties of the Majoranas is discussed that requires only three qubits."
1191,1501.04342,2015,2,19,14,Quantum Contextuality with Stabilizer States,Mark Howard;Eoin Brennan;Jiri Vala,"The Pauli groups are ubiquitous in quantum information theory because of their usefulness in describing quantum states and operations and their readily understood symmetry properties. In addition, the most well-understood quantum error correcting codes -- stabilizer codes -- are built using Pauli operators. The eigenstates of these operators -- stabilizer states -- display a structure (e.g., mutual orthogonality relationships) that has made them useful in examples of multi-qubit non-locality and contextuality. Here, we apply the graph-theoretical contextuality formalism of Cabello, Severini and Winter to sets of stabilizer states, with particular attention to the effect of generalizing two-level qubit systems to odd prime d-level qudit systems. While state-independent contextuality using two-qubit states does not generalize to qudits, we show explicitly how state-dependent contextuality associated with a Bell inequality does generalize. Along the way we note various structural properties of stabilizer states, with respect to their orthogonality relationships, which may be of independent interest."
1192,1501.02817,2015,2,6,14,MERA for Spin Chains with Continuously Varying Criticality,Jacob C Bridgeman;Aroon O'Brien;Stephen D Bartlett;Andrew C Doherty,"We use the multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz (MERA) to numerically investigate three critical quantum spin chains with Z_2 x Z_2 on-site symmetry: a staggered XXZ model, a transverse field cluster model, and the quantum Ashkin-Teller model. All three models possess a continuous one-parameter family of critical points. Along this critical line, the thermodynamic limit of these models is expected to be described by classes of c=1 conformal field theories (CFTs) of two possible types: the S^1 free boson and its Z_2-orbifold. Our numerics using MERA with explicitly enforced Z_2 x Z_2 symmetry allow us to extract conformal data for each model, with strong evidence supporting the identification of the staggered XXZ model and critical transverse field cluster model with the S^1 boson CFT, and the Ashkin-Teller model with the Z_2-orbifold boson CFT. Our first two models describe the phase transitions between symmetry protected topologically ordered phases and trivial phases, which lie outside the usual Landau-Ginsburg-Wilson paradigm of symmetry breaking. Our results show that a range of critical theories can arise at the boundary of a single symmetry protected phase."
1193,1501.01298,2015,2,2,14,Magic State Distillation and Gate Compilation in Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Chemistry,Colin J Trout;Kenneth R Brown,"Quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry map the dynamics of electrons in a molecule to the dynamics of a coupled spin system. To reach chemical accuracy for interesting molecules, a large number of quantum gates must be applied which implies the need for quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Arbitrary fault-tolerant operations can be constructed from a small, universal set of fault-tolerant operations by gate compilation. Quantum chemistry algorithms are compiled by decomposing the dynamics of the coupled spin-system using a Trotter formula, synthesizing the decomposed dynamics using Clifford operations and single-qubit rotations, and finally approximating the single-qubit rotations by a sequence of fault-tolerant single-qubit gates. Certain fault-tolerant gates rely on the preparation of specific single-qubit states referred to as magic states. As a result, gate compilation and magic state distillation are critical for solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. We review recent progress that has improved the efficiency of gate compilation and magic state distillation by orders of magnitude."

Our scheme violates a quantum analogue of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, which states that every (classical) constitution endowed with three innocuous-seeming properties is a dictatorship. Superpositions, interference, and entanglement of votes feature in voting tactics available to quantum voters but not to classical."
1195,1412.7642,2014,1,7,14,Symmetry Breaking and the Geometry of Reduced Density Matrices,Valentin Zauner;Damian Draxler;Laurens Vanderstraeten;Jutho Haegeman;Frank Verstraete,"The concept of symmetry breaking and the emergence of corresponding local order parameters constitute the pillars of modern day many body physics. The theory of quantum entanglement is currently leading to a paradigm shift in understanding quantum correlations in many body systems and in this work we show how symmetry breaking can be understood from this wavefunction centered point of view. We demonstrate that the existence of symmetry breaking is a consequence of the geometric structure of the convex set of reduced density matrices of all possible many body wavefunctions. The surfaces of those convex bodies exhibit non-analytic behavior in the form of ruled surfaces, which turn out to be the defining signatures for the emergence of symmetry breaking and of an associated order parameter. We illustrate this by plotting the convex sets arising in the context of three paradigmatic examples of many body systems exhibiting symmetry breaking: the quantum Ising model in transverse magnetic field, exhibiting a second order quantum phase transition; the classical Ising model at finite temperature in two dimensions, which orders below a critical temperature $T_c$; and a system of free bosons at finite temperature in three dimensions, exhibiting the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation together with an associated order parameter $\langle\psi\rangle$. Remarkably, these convex sets look all very much alike. We believe that this wavefunction based way of looking at phase transitions demystifies the emergence of order parameters and provides a unique novel tool for studying exotic quantum phenomena."

1197,1410.8562,2014,12,25,14,Leakage Suppression in the Toric Code,Martin Suchara;Andrew W Cross;Jay M Gambetta,"Quantum codes excel at correcting local noise but fail to correct leakage faults that excite qubits to states outside the computational space. Aliferis and Terhal have shown that an accuracy threshold exists for leakage faults using gadgets called leakage reduction units (LRUs). However, these gadgets reduce the accuracy threshold and can increase overhead and experimental complexity, and these costs have not been thoroughly understood. Our work explores a variety of techniques for leakage-resilient, fault-tolerant error correction in the context of topological codes. Our contributions are threefold. First, we develop a leakage model that differs in critical details from earlier models. Second, we use Monte-Carlo simulations to survey several syndrome extraction circuits. Third, given the capability to perform three-outcome measurements, we present a dramatically improved syndrome processing algorithm. Our simulation results show that simple circuits with one extra CNOT per qubit and no additional ancillas reduce the accuracy threshold by less than a factor of 4 when leakage and depolarizing noise rates are comparable. This becomes a factor of 2 when the decoder uses 3-outcome measurements. Finally, when the physical error rate is less than 2 x 10^-4, placing LRUs after every gate may achieve the lowest logical error rates of all of the circuits we considered. We expect the closely related planar and rotated codes to exhibit the same accuracy thresholds and that the ideas may generalize naturally to other topological codes."

In the Wigner phase space picture, quantum Bochner's theorem gives the necessary and sufficient conditions on a function such that it is a quantum characteristic function of a valid (and possibly mixed) quantum state and such that its Fourier transform is a true probability density. We extend this theorem to discrete phase space representations which possess enough symmetry. More precisely, we show that discrete phase space representations that are built on projective unitary representations of abelian groups, with a slight restriction on admissible 2-cocycles, enable a quantum Bochner's theorem."

It was recently found that being able to constrain the form of ground states of SPT order based on symmetry properties also allows to explore novel resource states for processing of quantum information. In this paper, we generalize the consideration of Else et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \bf 108, 240505 (2012)] where it was shown that the ground-state form of spin-1 chains protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry supports perfect operation of the identity gate, important also for long-distance transmission of quantum information. We develop a formalism to constrain the ground-state form of SPT phases protected by any arbitrary finite symmetry group and use it to examine examples of ground states of SPT phases protected by various finite groups for similar gate protections. We construct a particular Hamiltonian invariant under $A_4$ symmetry transformation which is one of the groups that allows protected identity operation and examine its ground states. We find that there is an extended region where the ground state is the AKLT state, which not only supports the identity gate but also arbitrary single-qubit gates."

We investigate its relationship with the usual quantum query complexity $Q(f)$, and show that $B(f)=\Theta(Q(f)^2)$. This result gives a new method to upper bound the quantum query complexity: we give a method of finding bomb query algorithms from classical algorithms, which then provide nonconstructive upper bounds on $Q(f)=\Theta(\sqrt{B(f)})$. We subsequently were able to give explicit quantum algorithms matching our upper bound method. We apply this method on the single-source shortest paths problem on unweighted graphs, obtaining an algorithm with $O(n^{1.5})$ quantum query complexity, improving the best known algorithm of $O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ [arXiv:quant-ph/0606127]. Applying this method to the maximum bipartite matching problem gives an $O(n^{1.75})$ algorithm, improving the best known trivial $O(n^2)$ upper bound."

First, we show that there exists a commuting quantum circuit that is not classically simulatable unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. This is the first formal evidence that a commuting quantum circuit is not classically simulatable even when the number of output qubits is exponentially small. Then, we consider a generalized version of the circuit and clarify the condition under which it is classically simulatable. Lastly, we apply the argument for the above evidence to Clifford circuits in a similar setting and provide evidence that such a circuit augmented by a depth-1 non-Clifford layer is not classically simulatable. These results reveal subtle differences between quantum and classical computation."
1202,1409.4338,2014,10,6,14,Smooth Entropy Bounds on One-Shot Quantum State Redistribution,Mario Berta;Matthias Christandl;Dave Touchette,"In quantum state redistribution as introduced in [Luo and Devetak (2009)] and [Devetak and Yard (2008)], there are four systems of interest: the $A$ system held by Alice, the $B$ system held by Bob, the $C$ system that is to be transmitted from Alice to Bob, and the $R$ system that holds a purification of the state in the $ABC$ registers. We give upper and lower bounds on the amount of quantum communication and entanglement required to perform the task of quantum state redistribution in a one-shot setting. Our bounds are in terms of the smooth conditional min- and max-entropy, and the smooth max-information. The protocol for the upper bound has a clear structure, building on the work [Oppenheim (2008)]: it decomposes the quantum state redistribution task into two simpler quantum state merging tasks by introducing a coherent relay. In the independent and identical (iid) asymptotic limit our bounds for the quantum communication cost converge to the quantum conditional mutual information $I(C:R|B)$, and our bounds for the total cost converge to the conditional entropy $H(C|B)$. This yields an alternative proof of optimality of these rates for quantum state redistribution in the iid asymptotic limit. In particular, we obtain a strong converse for quantum state redistribution, which even holds when allowing for feedback."
1203,1407.4817,2014,9,25,14,Reliable quantum certification for photonic quantum technologies,Leandro Aolita;Christian Gogolin;Martin Kliesch;Jens Eisert,"A major roadblock for large-scale photonic quantum technologies is the lack of practical reliable certification tools. We introduce an experimentally friendly - yet mathematically rigorous - certification test for experimental preparations of arbitrary m-mode pure Gaussian states, pure non-Gaussian states generated by linear-optical circuits with n-boson Fock-basis states as inputs, and states of these two classes subsequently post-selected with local measurements on ancillary modes. The protocol is efficient in m and the inverse post-selection success probability for all Gaussian states and all mentioned non-Gaussian states with constant n. We follow the mindset of an untrusted prover, who prepares the state, and a skeptic certifier, with classical computing and single-mode homodyne-detection capabilities only. No assumptions are made on the type of noise or capabilities of the prover. Our technique exploits an extremality-based fidelity bound whose estimation relies on non-Gaussian state nullifiers, which we introduce on the way as a byproduct result. The certification of many-mode photonic networks, as those used for photonic quantum simulations, boson samplers, and quantum metrology, is now within reach."

Relative to such a set, we define a ""MUB-balanced state"" to be a pure state for which the list of probabilities of the $d$ outcomes of one of these measurements is independent of the choice of measurement, up to permutations. In this paper we explicitly construct a MUB-balanced state for each prime power dimension $d$ for which $d = 3$ (mod 4). These states have already been constructed by Appleby in unpublished notes, but our presentation here is different in that both the expression for the states themselves and the proof of MUB-balancedness are given in terms of the discrete Wigner function, rather than the density matrix or state vector. The discrete Wigner functions of these states are ""rotationally symmetric"" in a sense roughly analogous to the rotational symmetry of the energy eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator in the continuous two-dimensional phase space. Upon converting the Wigner function to a density matrix, we find that the states are expressible as real state vectors in the standard basis. We observe numerically that when $d$ is large (and not a power of 3), a histogram of the components of such a state vector appears to form a semicircular distribution."
1205,1407.3567,2014,7,21,14,Two approaches to obtain the strong converse exponent of quantum hypothesis testing for general sequences of quantum states,Milán Mosonyi;Tomohiro Ogawa,"We present two general approaches to obtain the strong converse rate of quantum hypothesis testing for correlated quantum states. One approach requires that the states satisfy a certain factorization property; typical examples of such states are the temperature states of translation-invariant finite-range interactions on a spin chain. The other approach requires the differentiability of a regularized Rényi $\alpha$-divergence in the parameter $\alpha$; typical examples of such states include temperature states of non-interacting fermionic lattice systems, and classical irreducible Markov chains. In all cases, we get that the strong converse exponent is equal to the Hoeffding anti-divergence, which in turn is obtained from the regularized Rényi divergences of the two states."
1206,1407.1485,2014,7,16,14,Error suppression in Hamiltonian based quantum computation using energy penalties,Adam D Bookatz;Edward Farhi;Leo Zhou,"We consider the use of quantum error detecting codes, together with energy penalties against leaving the codespace, as a method for suppressing environmentally induced errors in Hamiltonian based quantum computation. This method was introduced in [1] in the context of quantum adiabatic computation, but we consider it more generally. Specifically, we consider a computational Hamiltonian, which has been encoded using the logical qubits of a single-qubit error detecting code, coupled to an environment of qubits by interaction terms that act one-locally on the system. Energy penalty terms are added that penalize states outside of the codespace. We prove that in the limit of infinitely large penalties, one-local errors are completely suppressed, and we derive some bounds for the finite penalty case. Our proof technique involves exact integration of the Schrodinger equation, making no use of master equations or their assumptions. We perform long time numerical simulations on a small (one logical qubit) computational system coupled to an environment and the results suggest that the energy penalty method achieves even greater protection than our bounds indicate."

In the case of general linear groups over a finite field $F_q$, given a sequence of positive integers $n_1, ..., n_k$, where $n=n_1+...+n_k$, a parabolic subgroup of parameter $(n_1, ..., n_k)$ in $GL_n(F_q)$ is a conjugate of the subgroup consisting of block lower triangular matrices where the $i$th block is of size $n_i$. Our main result is a quantum algorithm of time polynomial in $\log q$ and $n$ for solving the hidden subgroup problem in $GL_n(F_q)$, when the hidden subgroup is promised to be a parabolic subgroup. Our algorithm works with no prior knowledge of the parameter of the hidden parabolic subgroup. Prior to this work, such an efficient quantum algorithm was only known for the case $n=2$ (A. Denney, C. Moore, and A. Russell (2010), Quantum Inf. Comput., Vol. 10, pp. 282-291), and for minimal parabolic subgroups (Borel subgroups), for the case when $q$ is not much smaller than $n$ (G. Ivanyos: Quantum Inf. Comput., Vol. 12, pp. 661-669)."
1208,1406.5974,2014,7,8,14,Error Thresholds for Abelian Quantum Double Models: Increasing the bit-flip Stability of Topological Quantum Memory,Ruben S Andrist;James R Wootton;Helmut G Katzgraber,"Current approaches for building quantum computing devices focus on two-level quantum systems which nicely mimic the concept of a classical bit, albeit enhanced with additional quantum properties. However, rather than artificially limiting the number of states to two, the use of d-level quantum systems (qudits) could provide advantages for quantum information processing. Among other merits, it has recently been shown that multi-level quantum systems can offer increased stability to external disturbances - a key problem in current technologies. In this study we demonstrate that topological quantum memories built from qudits, also known as abelian quantum double models, exhibit a substantially increased resilience to noise. That is, even when taking into account the multitude of errors possible for multi-level quantum systems, topological quantum error correction codes employing qudits can sustain a larger error rate than their two-level counterparts. In particular, we find strong numerical evidence that the thresholds of these error-correction codes are given by the hashing bound. Considering the significantly increased error thresholds attained, this might well outweigh the added complexity of engineering and controlling higher dimensional quantum systems."
1209,1406.5090,2014,6,26,14,"Gapped quantum liquids and topological order, stochastic local transformations and emergence of unitarity",Bei Zeng;Xiao-Gang Wen,"In this work we present some new understanding of topological order, including three main aspects: (1) It was believed that classifying topological orders corresponds to classifying gapped quantum states. We show that such a statement is not precise. We introduce the concept of \emphgapped quantum liquid as a special kind of gapped quantum states that can ""dissolve"" any product states on additional sites. Topologically ordered states actually correspond to gapped quantum liquids with stable ground-state degeneracy. Symmetry-breaking states for on-site symmetry are also gapped quantum liquids, but with unstable ground-state degeneracy. (2) We point out that the universality classes of generalized local unitary (gLU) transformations (without any symmetry) contain both topologically ordered states and symmetry-breaking states. This allows us to use a gLU invariant -- topological entanglement entropy -- to probe the symmetry-breaking properties hidden in the exact ground state of a finite system, which does not break any symmetry. This method can probe symmetry- breaking orders even without knowing the symmetry and the associated order parameters. (3) The universality classes of topological orders and symmetry-breaking orders can be distinguished by \emphstochastic local (SL) transformations (i.e.\ \emphlocal invertible transformations): small SL transformations can convert the symmetry-breaking classes to the trivial class of product states with finite probability of success, while the topological-order classes are stable against any small SL transformations, demonstrating a phenomenon of emergence of unitarity. This allows us to give a new definition of long-range entanglement based on SL transformations, under which only topologically ordered states are long-range entangled."
1210,1405.6329,2014,6,24,14,Quantum Model Averaging,Christopher Ferrie,"Standard tomographic analyses ignore model uncertainty. It is assumed that a given model generated the data and the task is to estimate the quantum state, or a subset of parameters within that model. Here we apply a model averaging technique to mitigate the risk of overconfident estimates of model parameters in two examples: (1) selecting the rank of the state in tomography and (2) selecting the model for the fidelity decay curve in randomized benchmarking."
1211,1404.3747,2014,6,20,14,Low-distance Surface Codes under Realistic Quantum Noise,Yu Tomita;Krysta M Svore,"We study the performance of distance-three surface code layouts under realistic multi-parameter noise models. We first calculate their thresholds under depolarizing noise. We then compare a Pauli-twirl approximation of amplitude and phase damping to amplitude and phase damping. We find the approximate channel results in a pessimistic estimate of the logical error rate, indicating the realistic threshold may be higher than previously estimated. From Monte-Carlo simulations, we identify experimental parameters for which these layouts admit reliable computation. Due to its low resource cost and superior performance, we conclude that the 17-qubit layout should be targeted in early experimental implementations of the surface code. We find that architectures with gate times in the 5-40 ns range and T1 times of at least 1-2 us range will exhibit improved logical error rates with a 17-qubit surface code encoding."
1212,1404.1085,2014,5,27,14,The Quantum Marginal Problem,Christian Schilling,"The question of whether given density operators for subsystems of a multipartite quantum system are compatible to one common total density operator is known as the quantum marginal problem. We briefly review the solution of a subclass of such problems found just recently. In particular, this provides the solution of the $1$-body $N$-representability problem. Its solution, the so-called generalized Pauli constraints, restrict the set of mathematically possible fermionic occupation numbers significantly, and strengthens Pauli's exclusion principle. Moreover, we review the study of a concrete physical model of interacting fermions confined to a harmonic trap. There, we found occupation numbers close, but not exactly on the boundary of the allowed region. This new effect of quasipinning is physically relevant since it corresponds to a simplified structure of the corresponding $N$-fermion quantum state."
1213,1403.6545,2014,4,16,14,On The Power Of Coherently Controlled Quantum Adiabatic Evolutions,Maria Kieferova;Nathan Wiebe,"A major challenge facing adiabatic quantum computing is that algorithm design and error correction can be difficult for adiabatic quantum computing. Recent work has considered addressing his challenge by using coherently controlled adiabatic evolutions in the place of classically controlled evolution. An important question remains: what is the relative power of controlled adiabatic evolution to traditional adiabatic evolutions? We address this by showing that coherent control and measurement provides a way to average different adiabatic evolutions in ways that cause their diabatic errors to cancel, allowing for adiabatic evolutions to combine the best characteristics of existing adiabatic optimizations strategies that are mutually exclusive in conventional adiabatic QIP. This result shows that coherent control and measurement can provide advantages for adiabatic state preparation. We also provide upper bounds on the complexity of simulating such evolutions on a circuit based quantum computer and provide sufficiency conditions for the equivalence of controlled adiabatic evolutions to adiabatic quantum computing."
1214,1403.2543,2014,4,7,14,"Second-order asymptotics for source coding, dense coding and pure-state entanglement conversions",Nilanjana Datta;Felix Leditzky,"We introduce two variants of the information spectrum relative entropy defined by Tomamichel and Hayashi which have the particular advantage of satisfying the data-processing inequality, i.e. monotonicity under quantum operations. This property allows us to obtain one-shot bounds for various information-processing tasks in terms of these quantities. Moreover, these relative entropies have a second order asymptotic expansion, which in turn yields tight second order asymptotics for optimal rates of these tasks in the i.i.d. setting. The tasks studied in this paper are fixed-length quantum source coding, noisy dense coding, entanglement concentration, pure-state entanglement dilution, and transmission of information through a classical-quantum channel. In the latter case, we retrieve the second order asymptotics obtained by Tomamichel and Tan. Our results also yield the known second order asymptotics of fixed-length classical source coding derived by Hayashi. The second order asymptotics of entanglement concentration and dilution provide a refinement of the inefficiency of these protocols - a quantity which, in the case of entanglement dilution, was studied by Harrow and Lo. We prove how the discrepancy between the optimal rates of these two processes in the second order implies the irreversibility of entanglement concentration established by Kumagai and Hayashi. In addition, the spectral divergence rates of the Information Spectrum Approach (ISA) can be retrieved from our relative entropies in the asymptotic limit. This enables us to directly obtain the more general results of the ISA from our one-shot bounds."
1215,1402.6299,2014,3,27,14,Necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for classical simulations of quantum communication processes,Alberto Montina;Stefan Wolf,"We consider the process consisting of preparation, transmission through a quantum channel, and subsequent measurement of quantum states. The communication complexity of the channel is the minimal amount of classical communication required for classically simulating it. Recently, we reduced the computation of this quantity to a convex minimization problem with linear constraints. Every solution of the constraints provides an upper bound on the communication complexity. In this paper, we derive the dual maximization problem of the original one. The feasible points of the dual constraints, which are inequalities, give lower bounds on the communication complexity, as illustrated with an example. The optimal values of the two problems turn out to be equal (zero duality gap). By this property, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality in terms of a set of equalities and inequalities. We use these conditions and two reasonable but unproven hypotheses to derive the lower bound $n 2^{n-1}$ for a noiseless quantum channel with capacity equal to $n$ qubits. This lower bound can have interesting consequences in the context of the recent debate on the reality of the quantum state."
1216,1401.7996,2014,3,12,14,$\psi$-epistemic models are exponentially bad at explaining the distinguishability of quantum states,Matthew S Leifer,"The status of the quantum state is perhaps the most controversial issue in the foundations of quantum theory. Is it an epistemic state (state of knowledge) or an ontic state (state of reality)? In realist models of quantum theory, the epistemic view asserts that nonorthogonal quantum states correspond to overlapping probability measures over the true ontic states. This naturally accounts for a large number of otherwise puzzling quantum phenomena. For example, the indistinguishability of nonorthogonal states is explained by the fact that the ontic state sometimes lies in the overlap region, in which case there is nothing in reality that could distinguish the two states. For this to work, the amount of overlap of the probability measures should be comparable to the indistinguishability of the quantum states. In this letter, I exhibit a family of states for which the ratio of these two quantities must be $\leq 2de^{-cd}$ in Hilbert spaces of dimension $d$ that are divisible by $4$. This implies that, for large Hilbert space dimension, the epistemic explanation of indistinguishability becomes implausible at an exponential rate as the Hilbert space dimension increases."

Applying this idea to surface codes, we derive an improved version of the perfect matching decoding algorithm which uses these X/Z correlations."
1218,1401.6848,2014,2,1,14,AM with Multiple Merlins,Scott Aaronson;Russell Impagliazzo;Dana Moshkovitz,"We introduce and study a new model of interactive proofs: AM(k), or Arthur-Merlin with k non-communicating Merlins. Unlike with the better-known MIP, here the assumption is that each Merlin receives an independent random challenge from Arthur. One motivation for this model (which we explore in detail) comes from the close analogies between it and the quantum complexity class QMA(k), but the AM(k) model is also natural in its own right. We illustrate the power of multiple Merlins by giving an AM(2) protocol for 3SAT, in which the Merlins' challenges and responses consist of only n^1/2+o(1) bits each. Our protocol has the consequence that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), any algorithm for approximating a dense CSP with a polynomial-size alphabet must take n^(log n)^1-o(1) time. Algorithms nearly matching this lower bound are known, but their running times had never been previously explained. Brandao and Harrow have also recently used our 3SAT protocol to show quasipolynomial hardness for approximating the values of certain entangled games. In the other direction, we give a simple quasipolynomial-time approximation algorithm for free games, and use it to prove that, assuming the ETH, our 3SAT protocol is essentially optimal. More generally, we show that multiple Merlins never provide more than a polynomial advantage over one: that is, AM(k)=AM for all k=poly(n). The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games, which follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. on subsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can be closely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame."

For systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a constant-velocity bound that limits correlations to within a linear effective light cone. However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems with long-range interactions, since the best long-range bound is too loose to give the correct light-cone shape for any known spin model and since analytic solutions rarely exist. In this work, we experimentally determine the spatial and time-dependent correlations of a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system evolving under a long-range Ising- or XY-model Hamiltonian. For several different interaction ranges, we extract the shape of the light cone and measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. In many cases we find increasing propagation velocities, which violate the Lieb-Robinson prediction, and in one instance cannot be explained by any existing theory. Our results demonstrate that even modestly-sized quantum simulators are well-poised for studying complicated many-body systems that are intractable to classical computation."
1220,1312.5350,2013,1,28,14,When asymptotic LOCC offers no advantage over finite LOCC,Honghao Fu;Debbie W Leung;Laura Mančinska,"We consider bipartite LOCC, the class of operations implementable by local quantum operations and classical communication between two parties. Surprisingly, there are operations that cannot be implemented with finitely many messages but can be approximated to arbitrary precision with more and more messages. This significantly complicates the analysis of what can or cannot be approximated with LOCC. Towards alleviating this problem, we exhibit two scenarios in which allowing vanishing error does not help. The first scenario involves implementation of measurements with projective product measurement operators. The second scenario is the discrimination of unextendible product bases on two 3-dimensional systems."
1221,1312.0555,2013,1,22,14,"Group theoretic, Lie algebraic and Jordan algebraic formulations of the SIC existence problem",Marcus Appleby;Christopher A Fuchs;Huangjun Zhu,"Although symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC POVMs, or SICs for short) have been constructed in every dimension up to 67, a general existence proof remains elusive. The purpose of this paper is to show that the SIC existence problem is equivalent to three other, on the face of it quite different problems. Although it is still not clear whether these reformulations of the problem will make it more tractable, we believe that the fact that SICs have these connections to other areas of mathematics is of some intrinsic interest. Specifically, we reformulate the SIC problem in terms of (1) Lie groups, (2) Lie algebras and (3) Jordan algebras (the second result being a greatly strengthened version of one previously obtained by Appleby, Flammia and Fuchs). The connection between these three reformulations is non-trivial: It is not easy to demonstrate their equivalence directly, without appealing to their common equivalence to SIC existence. In the course of our analysis we obtain a number of other results which may be of some independent interest."
1222,1311.6777,2013,12,20,14,Quantum Algorithms for Learning Symmetric Juntas via the Adversary Bound,Aleksandrs Belovs,"In this paper, we study the following variant of the junta learning problem. We are given oracle access to a Boolean function $f$ on $n$ variables that only depends on $k$ variables, and, when restricted to them, equals some predefined function $h$. The task is to identify the variables the function depends on. When $h$ is the XOR or the OR function, this gives a restricted variant of the Bernstein-Vazirani or the combinatorial group testing problem, respectively. We analyse the general case using the adversary bound, and give an alternative formulation for the quantum query complexity of this problem. We construct optimal quantum query algorithms for the cases when $h$ is the OR function (complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{k})$) or the exact-half function (complexity is $\Theta(k^{1/4})$). The first algorithm resolves an open problem from arXiv:1210.1148. For the case when $h$ is the majority function, we prove an upper bound of $O(k^{1/4})$. All these algorithms can be made exact. We obtain a quartic improvement when compared to the randomised complexity (if $h$ is the exact-half or the majority function), and a quadratic one when compared to the non-adaptive quantum complexity (for all functions considered in the paper)."
1223,1311.5269,2013,12,3,14,Quantum Hamiltonian Learning Using Imperfect Quantum Resources,Nathan Wiebe;Christopher E Granade;Christopher Ferrie;David G Cory,"Identifying an accurate model for the dynamics of a quantum system is a vexing problem that underlies a range of problems in experimental physics and quantum information theory. Recently, a method called quantum Hamiltonian learning has been proposed by the present authors that uses quantum simulation as a resource for modeling an unknown quantum system. This approach can, under certain circumstances, allow such models to be efficiently identified. A major caveat of that work is the assumption of that all elements of the protocol are noise-free. Here, we show that quantum Hamiltonian learning can tolerate substantial amounts of depolarizing noise and show numerical evidence that it can tolerate noise drawn from other realistic models. We further provide evidence that the learning algorithm will find a model that is maximally close to the true model in cases where the hypothetical model lacks terms present in the true model. Finally, we also provide numerical evidence that the algorithm works for non-commuting models. This work illustrates that quantum Hamiltonian learning can be performed using realistic resources and suggests that even imperfect quantum resources may be valuable for characterizing quantum systems."

We develop ""Repeat-Until-Success"" (RUS) circuits and characterize unitaries that can be exactly represented as an RUS circuit. Our RUS circuits operate by conditioning on a given measurement outcome and using only a small number of non-Clifford gates and ancilla qubits. We construct an algorithm based on RUS circuits that approximates an arbitrary single-qubit $Z$-axis rotation to within distance $\epsilon$, where the number of $T$ gates scales as $1.26\log_2(1/\epsilon) - 3.53$, an improvement of roughly three-fold over state-of-the-art techniques. We then extend our algorithm and show that a scaling of $2.4\log_2(1/\epsilon) - 3.28$ can be achieved for arbitrary unitaries and a small range of $\epsilon$, which is roughly twice as good as optimal deterministic decomposition methods."

Although it is impossible to amplify randomness from a single source by classical means, the situation is different considering non-local correlations allowed by quantum mechanics. Here we give the first device-independent protocol for randomness amplification using a constant number of devices. The protocol involves four devices, can amplify any non-deterministic source into a fully random source, tolerates a constant rate of error, and has its correctness based solely on the assumption of no-signaling between the devices. In contrast all previous protocols either required an unbounded number of devices, or could only amplify sources sufficiently close to fully random."

In the exploration of ultimate limits to such protocols, the property of symmetric extendibility of underlying bipartite states $\rho_{AB}$ plays an important role. A bipartite state $\rho_{AB}$ is symmetric extendible if there exits a tripartite state $\rho_{ABB'}$, such that the $AB$ marginal state is identical to the $AB'$ marginal state, i.e. $\rho_{AB'}=\rho_{AB}$. For a symmetric extendible state $\rho_{AB}$, the first task of the public discussion protocol is to break this symmetric extendibility. Therefore to characterize all bi-partite quantum states that possess symmetric extensions is of vital importance. We prove a simple analytical formula that a two-qubit state $\rho_{AB}$ admits a symmetric extension if and only if $\tr(\rho_B^2)\geq \tr(\rho_{AB}^2)-4\sqrt{\det{\rho_{AB}}}$. Given the intimate relationship between the symmetric extension problem and the quantum marginal problem, our result also provides the first analytical necessary and sufficient condition for the quantum marginal problem with overlapping marginals."

Here we establish a series of properties of subentropy, paralleling the well-developed analogous theory for von Neumann entropy. Further, we show that subentropy is a lower bound for min-entropy. We introduce a notion of conditional subentropy and show that it can be used to provide an upper bound for the guessing probability of any classical-quantum state of two qubits; we conjecture that the bound applies also in higher dimensions. Finally we give an operational interpretation of subentropy within classical information theory."
1230,1308.0539,2013,10,15,14,Inequalities for the Ranks of Quantum States,Josh Cadney;Marcus Huber;Noah Linden;Andreas Winter,"We investigate relations between the ranks of marginals of multipartite quantum states. These are the Schmidt ranks across all possible bipartitions and constitute a natural quantification of multipartite entanglement dimensionality. We show that there exist inequalities constraining the possible distribution of ranks. This is analogous to the case of von Neumann entropy (\alpha-Rényi entropy for \alpha=1), where nontrivial inequalities constraining the distribution of entropies (such as e.g. strong subadditivity) are known. It was also recently discovered that all other \alpha-Rényi entropies for $\alpha\in(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)$ satisfy only one trivial linear inequality (non-negativity) and the distribution of entropies for $\alpha\in(0,1)$ is completely unconstrained beyond non-negativity. Our result resolves an important open question by showing that also the case of \alpha=0 (logarithm of the rank) is restricted by nontrivial linear relations and thus the cases of von Neumann entropy (i.e., \alpha=1) and 0-Rényi entropy are exceptionally interesting measures of entanglement in the multipartite setting."
1231,1307.5893,2013,10,7,14,Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation I: techniques and challenges,Kevin C Young;Mohan Sarovar;Robin Blume-Kohout,"Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) is known to possess some intrinsic robustness, though it is likely that some form of error correction will be necessary for large scale computations. Error handling routines developed for circuit-model quantum computation do not transfer easily to the AQC model since these routines typically require high-quality quantum gates, a resource not generally allowed in AQC. There are two main techniques known to suppress errors during an AQC implementation: energy gap protection and dynamical decoupling. Here we show that both these methods are intimately related and can be analyzed within the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression techniques and identify critical constraints on the performance of error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself is insufficient for large-scale, fault-tolerant AQC and that a form of error correction is needed. We discuss progress towards implementing error correction in AQC and enumerate several key outstanding problems. This work is a companion paper to ""Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation II: non-equilibrium dynamics""', which provides a dynamical model perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and error correction in AQC. In this paper we discuss the same results within a quantum information framework, permitting an intuitive discussion of error suppression and correction in encoded AQC."

Previous works have established at least two different techniques for error suppression in AQC. In this paper we derive a model for describing the dynamics of encoded AQC and show that previous constructions for error suppression can be unified with this dynamical model. In addition the model clarifies the mechanisms of error suppression and allow identification of its weaknesses. In the second half of the paper we utilize our description of non-equilibrium dynamics in encoded AQC to construct methods for error correction in AQC by cooling local degrees of freedom (qubits). While this is shown to be possible in principle, we also identify the key challenge to this approach: the requirement of high-weight Hamiltonians. Finally, we use our dynamical model to perform a simplified thermal stability analysis of concatenated-stabilizer-code encoded many-body systems for AQC or quantum memories. This work is a companion paper to ""\textitError suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation I: techniques and challenges"" (Phys. Rev. X, 3, 041013 (2013)), which provides a quantum information perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and correction in AQC. In this paper we couch the same results within a dynamical framework, which allows for detailed analysis of the non-equilibrium dynamics of error suppression and correction in encoded AQC."

The first party's computational capabilities can be extremely limited: she must only be able to create and measure single-qubit superposition states. The second party is not required to use measurement-based quantum computation. The protocol requires the (optimal) exchange of O(J log(N)) single-qubit states, where J is the computational depth and N is the number of qubits needed for the computation."
1234,1305.1327,2013,7,24,14,Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Testing Equivalence of Group Extensions,Kevin C Zatloukal,"While efficient algorithms are known for solving many important problems related to groups, no efficient algorithm is known for determining whether two arbitrary groups are isomorphic. The particular case of 2-nilpotent groups, a special type of central extension, is widely believed to contain the essential hard cases. However, looking specifically at central extensions, the natural formulation of being ""the same"" is not isomorphism but rather ""equivalence,"" which requires an isomorphism to preserves the structure of the extension. In this paper, we show that equivalence of central extensions can be computed efficiently on a classical computer when the groups are small enough to be given by their multiplication tables. However, in the model of black box groups, which allows the groups to be much larger, we show that equivalence can be computed efficiently on a quantum computer but not a classical one (under common complexity assumptions). Our quantum algorithm demonstrates a new application of the hidden subgroup problem for general abelian groups."

The generators of such evolutions are called Lindbladians. In the setting of quantum many-body systems on a lattice it is natural to consider Lindbladians that decompose into a sum of local interactions with decreasing strength with respect to the size of their support. For both practical and theoretical reasons, it is crucial to estimate the impact that perturbations in the generating Lindbladian, arising as noise or errors, can have on the evolution. These local perturbations are potentially unbounded, but constrained to respect the underlying lattice structure. We show that even for polynomially decaying errors in the Lindbladian, local observables and correlation functions are stable if the unperturbed Lindbladian has a unique fixed point and a mixing time which scales logarithmically with the system size. The proof relies on Lieb-Robinson bounds, which describe a finite group velocity for propagation of information in local systems. As a main example, we prove that classical Glauber dynamics is stable under local perturbations, including perturbations in the transition rates which may not preserve detailed balance."
1236,1303.0808,2013,5,7,14,Sequential decoding of a general classical-quantum channel,Mark M Wilde,"Since a quantum measurement generally disturbs the state of a quantum system, one might think that it should not be possible for a sender and receiver to communicate reliably when the receiver performs a large number of sequential measurements to determine the message of the sender. We show here that this intuition is not true, by demonstrating that a sequential decoding strategy works well even in the most general ""one-shot"" regime, where we are given a single instance of a channel and wish to determine the maximal number of bits that can be communicated up to a small failure probability. This result follows by generalizing a non-commutative union bound to apply for a sequence of general measurements. We also demonstrate two ways in which a receiver can recover a state close to the original state after it has been decoded by a sequence of measurements that each succeed with high probability. The second of these methods will be useful in realizing an efficient decoder for fully quantum polar codes, should a method ever be found to realize an efficient decoder for classical-quantum polar codes."
1237,1302.0398,2013,3,20,14,Towards efficient decoding of classical-quantum polar codes,Mark M Wilde;Olivier Landon-Cardinal;Patrick Hayden,"Known strategies for sending bits at the capacity rate over a general channel with classical input and quantum output (a cq channel) require the decoder to implement impractically complicated collective measurements. Here, we show that a fully collective strategy is not necessary in order to recover all of the information bits. In fact, when coding for a large number N uses of a cq channel W, N I(W_acc) of the bits can be recovered by a non-collective strategy which amounts to coherent quantum processing of the results of product measurements, where I(W_acc) is the accessible information of the channel W. In order to decode the other N (I(W) - I(W_acc)) bits, where I(W) is the Holevo rate, our conclusion is that the receiver should employ collective measurements. We also present two other results: 1) collective Fuchs-Caves measurements (quantum likelihood ratio measurements) can be used at the receiver to achieve the Holevo rate and 2) we give an explicit form of the Helstrom measurements used in small-size polar codes. The main approach used to demonstrate these results is a quantum extension of Arikan's polar codes."
1238,1301.4505,2013,3,5,14,Black Hole Complementarity and the Harlow-Hayden Conjecture,Leonard Susskind,"Black hole complementarity, as originally formulated in the 1990's by Preskill, 't Hooft, and myself is now being challenged by the Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully firewall argument. The AMPS argument relies on an implicit assumption---the ``proximity postulate---which says that the interior of a black hole must be constructed from degrees of freedom that are physically near the black hole. The proximity postulate manifestly contradicts the idea that interior information is redundant with information in Hawking radiation, which is very far from the black hole. AMPS argue that a violation of the proximity postulate would lead to a contradiction in a thought-experiment in which Alice distills the Hawking radiation and brings a bit back to the black hole. According to AMPS the only way to protect against the contradiction is for a firewall to form at the Page time. But the measurement that Alice must make, is of such a fine-grained nature that carrying it out before the black hole evaporates may be impossible. Harlow and Hayden have found evidence that the limits of quantum computation do in fact prevent Alice from carrying out her experiment in less than exponential time. If their conjecture is correct then black hole complementarity may be alive and well. My aim here is to give an overview of the firewall argument, and its basis in the proximity postulate; as well as the counterargument based on computational complexity, as conjectured by Harlow and Hayden."

The entropy measure is based on hypothesis testing and has an elegant formulation as a semidefinite program, a type of convex optimization. After establishing a few basic properties, we prove upper and lower bounds in terms of the smooth entropies, a family of entropy measures that is used to characterize a wide range of operational quantities. From the formulation as a semidefinite program, we also prove a result on decomposition of hypothesis tests, which leads to a chain rule for the entropy."
1240,1210.1014,2012,1,22,14,Improved Quantum Query Algorithms for Triangle Finding and Associativity Testing,Troy Lee;Frederic Magniez;Miklos Santha,"We show that the quantum query complexity of detecting if an $n$-vertex graph contains a triangle is $O(n^{9/7})$. This improves the previous best algorithm of Belovs making $O(n^{35/27})$ queries. For the problem of determining if an operation $\circ : S \times S \rightarrow S$ is associative, we give an algorithm making $O(|S|^{10/7})$ queries, the first improvement to the trivial $O(|S|^{3/2})$ application of Grover search. Our algorithms are designed using the learning graph framework of Belovs. We give a family of algorithms for detecting constant-sized subgraphs, which can possibly be directed and colored. These algorithms are designed in a simple high-level language; our main theorem shows how this high-level language can be compiled as a learning graph and gives the resulting complexity. The key idea to our improvements is to allow more freedom in the parameters of the database kept by the algorithm. As in our previous work, the edge slots maintained in the database are specified by a graph whose edges are the union of regular bipartite graphs, the overall structure of which mimics that of the graph of the certificate. By allowing these bipartite graphs to be unbalanced and of variable degree we obtain better algorithms."
1241,1210.0913,2012,11,15,14,"Summoning Information in Spacetime, or Where and When Can a Qubit Be?",Patrick Hayden;Alex May,"One of the most important properties of quantum information, and the one ultimately responsible for its cryptographic applications, is that it can't be copied. That statement, however, is not completely accurate. While the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics prevents quantum information from being copied in space, the reversibility of microscopic physics actually requires that the information be copied in time. In spacetime as a whole, therefore, quantum information is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion. We fully characterize which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantum information. Because quantum information can be delocalized through quantum error correction and teleportation, it need not follow well-defined trajectories. Instead, replication of the information in any configuration of spacetime regions not leading to violations of causality or the no-cloning principle is allowed. To demonstrate this, we answer the operational question of exactly when the information can be summoned to a set of spacetime points, showing how to do so efficiently using a combination of teleportation and codeword-stabilized quantum codes. This provides a simple and complete description of where and when a qubit can be located in spacetime, revealing a remarkable variety of possibilities."

We consider the problem of estimating the mixing time (i.e., the spectral gap) of a quantum expander. We show that this problem is co-QMA-complete. This has applications to testing randomized constructions of quantum expanders, and studying thermalization of open quantum systems."

This demonstrates that entanglement distillability of the shared state is not necessary in order to surpass classical communication complexity.
1244,1208.6589,2012,10,3,14,Efficient Computation of the Permanent of Block Factorizable Matrices,Kristan Temme;Pawel Wocjan,"We present an efficient algorithm for computing the permanent for matrices of size N that can written as a product of L block diagonal matrices with blocks of size at most 2. For fixed L, the time and space resources scale linearly in N, with a prefactor that scales exponentially in L. This class of matrices contains banded matrices with banded inverse. We show that such a factorization into a product of block diagonal matrices gives rise to a circuit acting on a Hilbert space with a tensor product structure and that the permanent is equal to the transition amplitude of this circuit and a product basis state. In this correspondence, a block diagonal matrix gives rise to one layer of the circuit, where each block to a gate acting either on a single tensor component or on two adjacent tensor components. This observation allows us to adopt matrix product states, a computational method from condensed matter physics and quantum information theory used to simulate quantum systems, to evaluate the transition amplitude."
1245,1208.4123,2012,9,14,14,The completeness of quantum theory for predicting measurement outcomes,Roger Colbeck;Renato Renner,"The predictions that quantum theory makes about the outcomes of measurements are generally probabilistic. This has raised the question whether quantum theory can be considered complete, or whether there could exist alternative theories that provide improved predictions. Here we review recent work that considers arbitrary alternative theories, constrained only by the requirement that they are compatible with a notion of ""free choice"" (defined with respect to a natural causal order). It is shown that quantum theory is ""maximally informative"", i.e., there is no other compatible theory that gives improved predictions. Furthermore, any alternative maximally informative theory is necessarily equivalent to quantum theory. This means that the state a system has in such a theory is in one-to-one correspondence with its quantum-mechanical state (the wave function). In this sense, quantum theory is complete."

Arbitrarily long quantum computations can be executed reliably provided that noise terms acting collectively on k system qubits are sufficiently weak, and decay sufficiently rapidly with increasing k and with increasing spatial separation of the qubits."
1247,1207.0550,2012,8,22,14,A multi-prover interactive proof for NEXP sound against entangled provers,Tsuyoshi Ito;Thomas Vidick,"We prove a strong limitation on the ability of entangled provers to collude in a multiplayer game. Our main result is the first nontrivial lower bound on the class MIP* of languages having multi-prover interactive proofs with entangled provers; namely MIP* contains NEXP, the class of languages decidable in non-deterministic exponential time. While Babai, Fortnow, and Lund (Computational Complexity 1991) proved the celebrated equality MIP = NEXP in the absence of entanglement, ever since the introduction of the class MIP* it was open whether shared entanglement between the provers could weaken or strengthen the computational power of multi-prover interactive proofs. Our result shows that it does not weaken their computational power: MIP* contains MIP. At the heart of our result is a proof that Babai, Fortnow, and Lund's multilinearity test is sound even in the presence of entanglement between the provers, and our analysis of this test could be of independent interest. As a byproduct we show that the correlations produced by any entangled strategy which succeeds in the multilinearity test with high probability can always be closely approximated using shared randomness alone."

It is proved that the restriction of quantum computation to the DQC1 model does not change the complexity classes NQP and SBQP. As a main consequence, it follows that the DQC1 model cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses to the second level (more precisely, to AM), which answers the long-standing open problem posed by Knill and Laflamme under the very plausible complexity assumption. The argument developed in this paper also weakens the complexity assumption necessary for the existing impossibility results on classical simulation of various sub-universal quantum computing models, such as the IQP model and the Boson sampling."

This strategy is based on the exploitation of an unlimited amount of pre-shared entanglement plus the use of adaptive probings, where the input of the channel is interactively updated during the protocol. We show that, for the wide class of teleportation-covariant channels in arbitrary dimension, including Pauli, erasure, and bosonic Gaussian channels, the quantum Fisher information cannot exceed an ultimate bound given by the Choi matrix of the encoding channel. In particular, we show that the adaptive estimation of the noise parameters of a teleportation-covariant channel cannot beat the standard quantum limit, therefore establishing a new intimate connection between teleportation and quantum metrology. We also extend our methods and results to quantum channel discrimination, finding a corresponding ultimate bound for the minimum error probability."

Using only one pure qubit together with $l$ fully-mixed qubits we obtain measurement precision at the standard quantum limit, which is typically obtained using the same number of uncorrelated qubits in fully-pure states. The standard quantum limit can be exceeded using an additional qubit, which adds only a small amount of purity. We show that the discord in the final state vanishes only in the limit of attaining infinite precision for the parameter being estimated."

In particular, for quantum systems of dimension $d$, we explicitly construct a universal set of semigroup generators, parametrized by $d^2-3$ continuous parameters, and prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the dynamical simulation of a $d$ dimensional Markovian quantum system is the ability to implement a) quantum channels from the semigroups generated by elements of the universal set of generators, and b) unitary operations on the system. Furthermore, we provide an explicit algorithm for simulating the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system using this universal set of generators, and show that it is efficient, with respect to this universal set, when the number of distinct Lindblad operators (representing physical dissipation processes) scales polynomially with respect to the number of subsystems."

1253,1611.08047,2016,3,18,13,Topological Aspects of Quantum Entanglement,Louis H Kauffman;Eshan Mehrotra,"Kauffman and Lomonaco introduced the idea of understanding quantum entanglement (the non-local correlation of certain properties of particles) topologically by viewing unitary entangling operators as braiding operators. In the work of Alagic, Jarret and Jordan, it is shown that entanglement is a necessary condition for forming invariants of knots from braid closures via a Markov trace. We show their arguments do not generalize exactly to the unoriented case of quantum invariant state summation models of knots. However, the arguments do generalize completely to the oriented case of quantum invariant state summation models of knots. We also give a class of R-matrices that are entangling and are weak invariants of classical knots and links yet strong invariants of virtual knots and links. We also remark that the Jones polynomial for 3-stranded braids can be computed using operators that are not entangling, but the (unitary) computation is not in the framework of a Yang-Baxter state sum. This connection between topological braiding and quantum entanglement can be used as a framework for future work in understanding the properties of entangling gates in topological quantum computing by allowing us to determine distinguishing characteristics of both entangling operators and unentangling operators."

It can not only efficiently be computed in the Hilbert space dimension, but for non-interacting bosonic systems, one can compute the negativity efficiently in the number of modes. However, such an efficient computation does not carry over to the fermionic realm, the ultimate reason for this being that the partial transpose of a fermionic Gaussian state is no longer Gaussian. To provide a remedy for this state of affairs, in this work we introduce efficiently computable and rigorous upper and lower bounds to the negativity, making use of techniques of semi-definite programming, building upon the Lagrangian formulation of fermionic linear optics, and exploiting suitable products of Gaussian operators. We discuss examples in quantum many-body theory and hint at applications in the study of topological properties at finite temperature."

From the classification point of view, our results show that in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, the cohomological bosonic SPT phases protected by a general symmetry group $SG$ involving onsite and spatial symmetries are classified by the cohomology group $H^{d+1}(SG,U(1))$, in which both the time-reversal symmetry and mirror reflection symmetries should be treated as anti-unitary operations. In addition, for every SPT phase protected by a discrete symmetry group and some SPT phases protected by continous symmetry groups, generic tensor-network wavefunctions can be constructed which would be useful for the purpose of variational numerical simulations. As a by-product, our results demonstrate a generic connection between rather conventional symmetry enriched topological phases and SPT phases via an anyon condensation mechanism."

The proof starts from the majorization result of De Palma et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 62, 2895 (2016), and is based on a new logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Our result extends to noncommutative probability the seminal theorem ""Gaussian kernels have only Gaussian maximizers"" (Lieb, Invent. Math. 102, 179 (1990)), stating that Gaussian operators saturate the p->q norms of Gaussian integral kernels. Our result also implies that the p->q norms of the thinning are saturated by geometric probability distributions. Moreover, the multimode extension of our result would imply the multiplicativity of the p->q norms of quantum-limited Gaussian channels."

This is done by applying the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle to the set of translational invariant continuous matrix product states with periodic boundary conditions. Moreover, the ansatz is accompanied with additional boundary degrees of freedom to study quantum impurity problems. The algorithm allows for a cutoff in the spectrum of the transfer matrix and thus has an efficient computational scaling. In particular we study the prototypical example of an atomtronic system - an interacting Bose gas rotating in a ring shaped trap in the presence of a localised barrier potential."

Here, we find that even topological states with long-range quantum entanglement can be represented with classical artificial neural networks. This is demonstrated by using two concrete spin systems, the one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological cluster state and the 2D toric code state with an intrinsic topological order. For both cases we show rigorously that the topological ground states can be represented by short-range neural networks in an \it exact fashion. This neural network representation, in addition to being exact, is surprisingly \it efficient as the required number of hidden neurons is as small as the number of physical spins. Our exact construction of topological-order neuron-representation demonstrates explicitly the exceptional power of neural networks in describing exotic quantum states, and at the same time provides valuable topological data to supervise machine learning topological quantum orders in generic lattice models."

For this, we use Kosaki's definition of noncommutative $L_p$-spaces with respect to a state.

Our resource states fall into two classes: one as the qudit generalizations of the qubit cluster state, and the other as the higher-symmetry generalizations of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state, namely, with unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic symmetry. The symmetry in cluster states protects information propagation (identity gate), while the higher symmetry in AKLT-type states enables nontrivial gate computation. This work demonstrates a close connection between measurement-based quantum computation and symmetry-protected topological order."

A central goal is to find the fundamental limits of measuring time. One of the main obstacles is the fact that time is not an observable and thus has to be measured indirectly. Here we explore these questions by introducing a model of time measurements that is complete and self-contained. Specifically, our autonomous quantum clock consists of a system out of equilibrium --- a prerequisite for any system to function as a clock --- powered by minimal resources, namely two thermal baths at different temperatures. Through a detailed analysis of this specific clock model, we find that the laws of thermodynamics dictate a trade-off between the amount of dissipated heat and the clock's performance in terms of its accuracy and resolution. Our results furthermore imply that a fundamental entropy production is associated with the operation of *any* autonomous quantum clock, assuming that quantum machines cannot achieve perfect efficiency at finite power. More generally, autonomous clocks provide a natural framework for the exploration of fundamental questions about time in quantum theory and beyond."

To every gate $g$ in $\mathcal{S}$ we asign its image under the adjoint representation $\mathrm{Ad}_g$, where $\mathrm{Ad}:G\rightarrow SO(\mathfrak{g})$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. The necessary condition for the universality of $\mathcal{S}$ is that the only matrices that commute with all $\mathrm{Ad}_{g_i}$'s are proportional to the identity. If in addition there is an element in $<\mathcal{S}>$ whose Hilbert-Schmidt distance from the centre of $G$ belongs to $]0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$, then $\mathcal{S}$ is universal. Using these we provide a simple algorithm that allows deciding the universality of any set of $d$-dimensional gates in a finite number of steps and formulate the general classification theorem."

Parallel self-testing has recently been explored, aiming to self-test many copies (i.e. a tensor product) of the target state concurrently. In this work, we show that $n$ EPR pairs can be self-tested in parallel through $n$ copies of the well known CHSH game. We generalise this result further to a parallel self-test of $n$ tilted EPR pairs with arbitrary angles, and finally we show how our results and calculations can also be applied to obtain a parallel self-test of $2n$ EPR pairs via $n$ copies of the Mermin-Peres magic square game."

It is not difficult to show that such a modification does not change the computational power as long as the noise is not too strong so that errors are correctable with high probability, since if Merlin encodes the witness state in a quantum error-correction code and sends it to Arthur, Arthur can correct the error caused by the noisy channel. If we further assume that Arthur can do only single-qubit measurements, however, the problem becomes nontrivial, since in this case Arthur cannot do the universal quantum computation by himself. In this paper, we show that such a restricted complexity class is still equivalent to QMA. To show it, we use measurement-based quantum computing: honest Merlin sends the graph state to Arthur, and Arthur does fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing on the noisy graph state with only single-qubit measurements. By measuring stabilizer operators, Arthur also checks the correctness of the graph state. Although this idea itself was already used in several previous papers, these results cannot be directly used to the present case, since the test that checks the graph state used in these papers is so strict that even honest Merlin is rejected with high probability if the channel is noisy. We therefore introduce a more relaxed test that can accept not only the ideal graph state but also noisy graph states that are error-correctable."
1265,1608.04565,2016,9,8,13,A Superconducting Quantum Simulator for Topological Order and the Toric Code,Mahdi Sameti;Anton Potocnik;Daniel E Browne;Andreas Wallraff;Michael J Hartmann,"Topological order is now being established as a central criterion for characterizing and classifying ground states of condensed matter systems and complements categorizations based on symmetries. Fractional quantum Hall systems and quantum spin liquids are receiving substantial interest because of their intriguing quantum correlations, their exotic excitations and prospects for protecting stored quantum information against errors. Here we show that the Hamiltonian of the central model of this class of systems, the Toric Code, can be directly implemented as an analog quantum simulator in lattices of superconducting circuits. The four-body interactions, which lie at its heart, are in our concept realized via Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) that are driven by a suitably oscillating flux bias. All physical qubits and coupling SQUIDs can be individually controlled with high precision. Topologically ordered states can be prepared via an adiabatic ramp of the stabilizer interactions. Strings of qubit operators, including the stabilizers and correlations along non-contractible loops, can be read out via a capacitive coupling to read-out resonators. Moreover, the available single qubit operations allow to create and propagate elementary excitations of the Toric Code and to verify their fractional statistics. The architecture we propose allows to implement a large variety of many-body interactions and thus provides a versatile analog quantum simulator for topological order and lattice gauge theories."
1266,1608.01794,2016,8,18,13,Incompatibility of quantum channels,Teiko Heinosaari;Takayuki Miyadera,"Two quantum channels are called compatible if they can be obtained as marginals from a single broadcasting channel; otherwise they are incompatible. We derive a characterization of the compatibility relation in terms of concatenation and conjugation, and we show that all pairs of sufficiently noisy quantum channels are compatible. The complement relation of incompatibility can be seen as a unifying aspect for many quantum features. We demonstrate that several phenomena, such as impossibility of universal broadcasting and unavoidable measurement disturbance, appear naturally in this framework."
1267,1607.08335,2016,8,17,13,Reverse Data-Processing Theorems and Computational Second Laws,Francesco Buscemi,"Drawing on an analogy with the second law of thermodynamics for adiabatically isolated systems, Cover argued that data-processing inequalities may be seen as second laws for ""computationally isolated systems,"" namely, systems evolving without an external memory. Here we develop Cover's idea in two ways: on the one hand, we clarify its meaning and formulate it in a general framework able to describe both classical and quantum systems. On the other hand, we prove that also the reverse holds: the validity of data-processing inequalities is not only necessary, but also sufficient to conclude that a system is computationally isolated. This constitutes an information-theoretic analogue of Lieb's and Yngvason's entropy principle. We finally speculate about the possibility of employing Maxwell's demon to show that adiabaticity and memorylessness are in fact connected in a deeper way than what the formal analogy proposed here prima facie seems to suggest."
1268,1607.07759,2016,8,10,13,New security notions and feasibility results for authentication of quantum data,Sumegha Garg;Henry Yuen;Mark Zhandry,"We give a new class of security definitions for authentication in the quantum setting. These definitions capture and strengthen existing definitions of security against quantum adversaries for both classical message authentication codes (MACs) and well as full quantum state authentication schemes. The main feature of our definitions is that they precisely characterize the effective behavior of any adversary when the authentication protocol accepts, including correlations with the key. Our definitions readily yield a host of desirable properties and interesting consequences; for example, our security definition for full quantum state authentication implies that the entire secret key can be re-used if the authentication protocol succeeds. Next, we present several protocols satisfying our security definitions. We show that the classical Wegman-Carter authentication scheme with 3-universal hashing is secure against superposition attacks, as well as adversaries with quantum side information. We then present conceptually simple constructions of full quantum state authentication. Finally, we prove a lifting theorem which shows that, as long as a protocol can securely authenticate the maximally entangled state, it can securely authenticate any state, even those that are entangled with the adversary. Thus, this shows that protocols satisfying a fairly weak form of authentication security automatically satisfy a stronger notion of security (in particular, the definition of Dupuis, et al (2012))."

In terms of privacy, the best solutions that classical techniques can achieve are unfortunately not unconditionally secure in the sense that they are dependent on a hacker's computational power. Here we theoretically investigate, and experimentally demonstrate with Gaussian displacement and squeezing operations, a quantum solution that achieves the unconditional security of a user's privacy using the practical technology of continuous variables. We demonstrate losses of up to 10 km both ways between the client and the server and show that security can still be achieved. Our approach offers a number of practical benefits, which can ultimately allow for the potential widespread adoption of this quantum technology in future cloud-based computing networks."
1270,1607.06666,2016,7,29,13,Gravity in the Quantum Lab,Richard Howl;Lucia Hackermuller;David Edward Bruschi;Ivette Fuentes,"At the beginning of the previous century, Newtonian mechanics fell victim to two new revolutionary theories, Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR). Both theories have transformed our view of physical phenomena, with QM accurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small length scales, and GR correctly describing observations at larger length scales. However, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in their respective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. Theories and proposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidance towards the true unifying theory. Probing GR at small length scales where quantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently there has been a growing interest in probing the opposite regime, QM at large scales where relativistic effects are important. This is principally due to the fact that experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly in recent years with the promise of quantum technologies. Here we review recent advances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that will be able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties, playing particular attention to the role of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (QFTCS) in describing these experiments. Interestingly, theoretical work using QFTCS has illustrated that these quantum experiments could be used to enhance measurements of gravitational effects, such as Gravitational Waves (GWs). Furthermore, verification of such enhancements, as well as other QFTCS predictions in quantum experiments, would provide the first direct validation of this limiting case of quantum gravity, several decades after it was initially proposed."
1271,1606.08603,2016,7,27,13,Geometric inequalities from phase space translations,Stefan Huber;Robert Koenig;Anna Vershynina,"We establish a quantum version of the classical isoperimetric inequality relating the Fisher information and the entropy power of a quantum state. The key tool is a Fisher information inequality for a state which results from a certain convolution operation: the latter maps a classical probability distribution on phase space and a quantum state to a quantum state. We show that this inequality also gives rise to several related inequalities whose counterparts are well-known in the classical setting: in particular, it implies an entropy power inequality for the mentioned convolution operation as well as the isoperimetric inequality, and establishes concavity of the entropy power along trajectories of the quantum heat diffusion semigroup. As an application, we derive a Log-Sobolev inequality for the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and argue that it implies fast convergence towards the fixed point for a large class of initial states."
1272,1606.08444,2016,7,26,13,Space from Hilbert Space: Recovering Geometry from Bulk Entanglement,ChunJun Cao;Sean M Carroll;Spyridon Michalakis,"We examine how to construct a spatial manifold and its geometry from the entanglement structure of an abstract quantum state in Hilbert space. Given a decomposition of Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ into a tensor product of factors, we consider a class of ""redundancy-constrained states"" in $\mathcal{H}$ that generalize the area-law behavior for entanglement entropy usually found in condensed-matter systems with gapped local Hamiltonians. Using mutual information to define a distance measure on the graph, we employ classical multidimensional scaling to extract the best-fit spatial dimensionality of the emergent geometry. We then show that entanglement perturbations on such emergent geometries naturally give rise to local modifications of spatial curvature which obey a (spatial) analog of Einstein's equation. The Hilbert space corresponding to a region of flat space is finite-dimensional and scales as the volume, though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) scales like the area of the boundary. A version of the ER=EPR conjecture is recovered, in that perturbations that entangle distant parts of the emergent geometry generate a configuration that may be considered as a highly quantum wormhole."
1273,1606.03723,2016,7,25,13,A Theory of Resource Destruction,Zi-Wen Liu;Xueyuan Hu;Seth Lloyd,"Resource theory is a widely-applicable framework for analyzing the physical resources required for given tasks, such as computation, communication, and energy extraction. In this paper, we propose a general scheme for analyzing resource theories based on resource-destroying maps, which leave resource-free states unchanged but erase the resource stored in all other states. The linearity of the resource-destroying map depends on the convexity of the set of free states, but the scheme can be applied to any resource. In particular, we introduce a group of simple and general conditions that determine whether a quantum operation exhibits certain resource-free properties. Our theory reveals fundamental connections among basic elements of resource theories, namely free states, free operations and resource measures. Notably, we find a class of simple measures without optimization that are monotone nonincreasing under operations that commute with the resource-destroying map. We explicitly discuss our theory in the contexts of coherence, and in particular discord, for which a resource theory has hitherto not been formalized, to illustrate properties of resource destruction and provide new insights into these highly active fields."
1274,1606.00960,2016,6,29,13,Projecting 3D color codes onto 3D toric codes,Arun B Aloshious;Pradeep Kiran Sarvepalli,"Toric codes and color codes are two important classes of topological codes. Kubica, Yoshida, and Pastawski showed that any $D$-dimensional color code can be mapped to a finite number of toric codes in $D$-dimensions. In this paper we propose an alternate map of 3D color codes to 3D toric codes with a view to decoding 3D color codes. Our approach builds on Delfosse's result for 2D color codes and exploits the topological properties of these codes. Our result reduces the decoding of 3D color codes to that of 3D toric codes. Bit flip errors are decoded by projecting on one set of 3D toric codes while phase flip errors are decoded by projecting onto another set of 3D toric codes."
1275,1605.09598,2016,6,29,13,On Quantum Tensor Product Codes,Jihao Fan;Yonghui Li;Min-Hsiu Hsieh;Hanwu Chen,"In this paper, we present a general framework for the construction of quantum tensor product codes (QTPC). In a classical tensor product code (TPC), its parity check matrix is constructed via the tensor product of parity check matrices of the two component codes. We show that by adding some constraints on the component codes, we can get several classes of dual-containing TPCs. By selecting di?erent component codes, the proposed method enables the construction of a large family of QTPCs and they can provide the similar quantum error control abilities as the corresponding classical TPCs. In particular, if one of the component codes is selected as a burst error-correction code, then QTPCs have multiple quantum burst error-correction abilities, provided these bursts fall in distinct subblocks. Compared with concatenated quantum codes (CQC), the component code selections of QTPCs are much more exible than those of CQCs since only one of the component codes of QTPCs needs to satisfy the dual-containing restriction. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to construct QTPCs with parameters better than other classes of quantum error-correction codes (QECC), e.g., CQCs and quantum BCH codes. It is known that classical TPCs cannot have parameters better than classical BCH codes. However, we show that QTPCs can have better parameters than quantum BCH codes. Many QTPCs are obtained with parameters better than previously known QECCs available in the literature."
1276,1605.03604,2016,6,6,13,Errors and pseudo-thresholds for incoherent and coherent noise,Mauricio Gutiérrez;Conor Smith;Livia Lulushi;Smitha Janardan;Kenneth R Brown,"We compare the effect of single qubit incoherent and coherent errors on the logical error rate of the Steane [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code by performing an exact full-density-matrix simulation of an error correction step. We find that the effective 1-qubit process matrix at the logical level reveals the key differences between the error models and provides insight into why the Pauli twirling approximation is a good approximation for incoherent errors and a poor approximation for coherent ones. Approximate channels composed of Clifford operations and Pauli measurement operators that are pessimistic at the physical level result in pessimistic error rates at the logical level. In addition, we observe that the pseudo-threshold can differ by a factor of five depending on whether the error is calculated using the fidelity or the distance."
1277,1604.00568,2016,6,1,13,Continuity bounds for information characteristics of quantum channels depending on input dimension,M E Shirokov,We show how to use properties of the quantum conditional mutual information to obtain continuity bounds for information characteristics of quantum channels depending on their input dimension. First we prove tight estimates for variation of the output Holevo quantity with respect to simultaneous variations of a channel and of an input ensemble. Then we obtain tight continuity bounds for output conditional mutual information for a single channel and for $n$ copies of a channel. As a result tight and close-to-tight continuity bounds for basic capacities of quantum channels depending on the input dimension are obtained. They complement the Leung-Smith continuity bounds depending on the output dimension.
1278,1603.09298,2016,5,13,13,Lieb-Robinson and the butterfly effect,Daniel A Roberts;Brian Swingle,"As experiments are increasingly able to probe the quantum dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom, it is interesting to probe fundamental bounds on the dynamics of quantum information. We elaborate on the relationship between one such bound---the Lieb-Robinson bound---and the butterfly effect in strongly-coupled quantum systems. The butterfly effect implies the ballistic growth of local operators in time, which can be quantified with the ""butterfly"" velocity $v_B$. Similarly, the Lieb-Robinson velocity places a state independent ballistic upper bound on the size of time evolved operators in non-relativistic lattice models. Here, we argue that $v_B$ is a state-dependent effective Lieb-Robinson velocity. We study the butterfly velocity in a wide variety of quantum field theories using holography and compare with free particle computations to understand the role of strong coupling. We find that, depending on the way length and time scale, $v_B$ acquires a temperature dependence and decreases towards the IR. We also comment on experimental prospects and on the relationship between the butterfly velocity and signaling."
1279,1603.06509,2016,4,5,13,Quantum work and the thermodynamic cost of quantum measurements,Sebastian Deffner;Juan Pablo Paz;Wojciech H Zurek,"Quantum work is usually determined from two projective measurements of the energy at the beginning and at the end of a thermodynamic process. However, this paradigm cannot be considered thermodynamically consistent as it does not account for the thermodynamic cost of these measurements. To remedy this conceptual inconsistency we introduce a novel paradigm that relies only on the expected change of the average energy given the initial energy eigenbasis. In particular, we completely omit quantum measurements in the definition of quantum work, and hence quantum work is identified as a thermodynamic quantity of only the system. As main results we derive a modified quantum Jarzynski equality and a sharpened maximum work theorem in terms of the information free energy. Comparison of our results with the standard approach allows to quantify the informational cost of projective measurements."
1280,1603.02158,2016,3,31,13,Bipartite depolarizing channels,Ludovico Lami;Marcus Huber,"We introduce a 3-parameter class of maps acting on a bipartite system that are a natural generalisation of the depolarizing channel (and include it as a special case). Then, we find the exact regions of the parameter space that alternatively determine a positive, completely positive, entanglement-breaking or entanglement-annihilating map. This model displays a much richer behaviour than the one shown by a simple depolarizing channel, yet it stays exactly solvable. As an example of this richness, PPT but not entanglement-breaking maps are found. A simple example of a positive yet indecomposable map is provided. Then, the study of the entanglement-annihilating property is fully addressed. Finally, we apply our results to solve the problem of the entanglement annihilation caused in a bipartite system by a tensor product of local depolarizing channels. In this context, a conjecture recently posed in the literature is proven, and many related open questions are answered. To arrive at this result we furthermore show how the Hadamard product between quantum states can be implemented via local operations."
1281,1602.08656,2016,3,22,13,Quantum Arthur-Merlin with single-qubit measurements,Tomoyuki Morimae,"We show that the class QAM does not change even if the verifier's ability is restricted to only single-qubit measurements. To show the result, we use the idea of the measurement-based quantum computing: the verifier, who can do only single-qubit measurements, can test the graph state sent from the prover and use it for his measurement-based quantum computing. We also introduce a new QMA-complete problem related to the stabilizer test."
1282,1602.08362,2016,3,8,13,The strong converse theorem for the product-state capacity of quantum channels with ergodic Markovian memory,Tony Dorlas;Ciara Morgan,"Establishing the strong converse theorem for a communication channel confirms that the capacity of that channel, that is, the maximum achievable rate of reliable information communication, is the ultimate limit of communication over that channel. Indeed, the strong converse theorem for a channel states that coding at a rate above the capacity of the channel results in the convergence of the error to its maximum value 1 and that there is no trade-off between communication rate and decoding error. Here we prove that the strong converse theorem holds for the product-state capacity of quantum channels with ergodic Markovian correlated memory."
1283,1602.03297,2016,3,1,13,On the Concavity of Auxiliary Function in Classical-Quantum Channels,Hao-Chung Cheng;Min-Hsiu Hsieh,"The auxiliary function of a classical channel appears in two fundamental quantities that upper and lower bound the error probability, respectively. A crucial property of the auxiliary function is its concavity, which leads to several important results in finite block length analysis. In this paper, we prove that the auxiliary function of a classical-quantum channel also enjoys the same concave property, extending an earlier partial result to its full generality. The key component in our proof is a beautiful result of geometric means of operators."
1284,1602.03182,2016,2,29,13,Ultimate Capacity of a Linear Time-Invariant Bosonic Channel,Bhaskar Roy Bardhan;Jeffrey H Shapiro,We determine the ultimate classical information capacity of a linear time-invariant bosonic channel with additive phase-insensitive Gaussian noise. This channel can model fiber-optic communication at power levels below the threshold for significant nonlinear effects. We provide a general continuous-time result that gives the ultimate capacity for such a channel operating in the quasimonochromatic regime under an average power constraint. This ultimate capacity is compared with corresponding results for heterodyne and homodyne detection over the same channel.
1285,1602.02840,2016,2,11,13,Co-Designing a Scalable Quantum Computer with Trapped Atomic Ions,Kenneth R Brown;Jungsang Kim;Christopher Monroe,"The first generation of quantum computers are on the horizon, fabricated from quantum hardware platforms that may soon be able to tackle certain tasks that cannot be performed or modelled with conventional computers. These quantum devices will not likely be universal or fully programmable, but special-purpose processors whose hardware will be tightly co-designed with particular target applications. Trapped atomic ions are a leading platform for first generation quantum computers, but are also fundamentally scalable to more powerful general purpose devices in future generations. This is because trapped ion qubits are atomic clock standards that can be made identical to a part in 10^15, and their quantum circuit connectivity can be reconfigured through the use of external fields, without modifying the arrangement or architecture of the qubits themselves. In this article we show how a modular quantum computer of any size can be engineered from ion crystals, and how the wiring between ion trap qubits can be tailored to a variety of applications and quantum computing protocols."

This class of examples includes some theories with dynamical exponent different from one, but does not include conformal field theories. The key property of the states we consider is that the ground state wavefunction is related to the statistical weight of a local statistical model. We give several examples of our construction in the context of Ising magnetism."
1287,1602.00401,2016,2,10,13,Quantum Capacities for Entanglement Networks,Shawn X Cui;Zhengfeng Ji;Nengkun Yu;Bei Zeng,"We discuss quantum capacities for two types of entanglement networks: $\mathcal{Q}$ for the quantum repeater network with free classical communication, and $\mathcal{R}$ for the tensor network as the rank of the linear operation represented by the tensor network. We find that $\mathcal{Q}$ always equals $\mathcal{R}$ in the regularized case for the samenetwork graph. However, the relationships between the corresponding one-shot capacities $\mathcal{Q}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_1$ are more complicated, and the min-cut upper bound is in general not achievable. We show that the tensor network can be viewed as a stochastic protocol with the quantum repeater network, such that $\mathcal{R}_1$ is a natural upper bound of $\mathcal{Q}_1$. We analyze the possible gap between $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{Q}_1$ for certain networks, and compare them with the one-shot classical capacity of the corresponding classical network."

Such a state, if exists, will be a common resource for the given set of states. We completely solve this problem for bipartite pure states case by explicitly constructing a unique optimal common resource state for any given set of states. In the multipartite setting, the general problem becomes quite complicated, and we focus on finding nontrivial common resources for the whole multipartite state space of given dimensions. We show that GHZ_3 is a nontrivial common resource for three-qubit systems."

Or: How I learned to stop worrying about diabatic errors and love the anyon,Christina Knapp;Michael Zaletel;Dong E Liu;Meng Cheng;Parsa Bonderson;Chetan Nayak,"Topological phases of matter are a potential platform for the storage and processing of quantum information with intrinsic error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and with the length scales of the system, such as the distance between quasiparticles. However, it is less well-understood how error rates depend on the speed with which non-Abelian quasiparticles are braided. In general, diabatic corrections to the holonomy or Berry's matrix vanish at least inversely with the length of time for the braid, with faster decay occurring as the time-dependence is made smoother. We show that such corrections will not affect quantum information encoded in topological degrees of freedom, unless they involve the creation of topologically nontrivial quasiparticles. Moreover, we show how measurements that detect unintentionally created quasiparticles can be used to control this source of error."
1290,1601.05563,2016,1,26,13,Unconstrained distillation capacities of a pure-loss bosonic broadcast channel,Masahiro Takeoka;Kaushik P Seshadreesan;Mark M Wilde,"Bosonic channels are important in practice as they form a simple model for free-space or fiber-optic communication. Here we consider a single-sender two-receiver pure-loss bosonic broadcast channel and determine the unconstrained capacity region for the distillation of bipartite entanglement and secret key between the sender and each receiver, whenever they are allowed arbitrary public classical communication. We show how the state merging protocol leads to achievable rates in this setting, giving an inner bound on the capacity region. We also evaluate an outer bound on the region by using the relative entropy of entanglement and a `reduction by teleportation' technique. The outer bounds match the inner bounds in the infinite-energy limit, thereby establishing the unconstrained capacity region for such channels. Our result could provide a useful benchmark for implementing a broadcasting of entanglement and secret key through such channels. An important open question relevant to practice is to determine the capacity region in both this setting and the single-sender single-receiver case when there is an energy constraint on the transmitter."

We describe three complexity-theoretic applications: (1) a proof that the recent breakthrough lower bound of Lee, Raghavendra, and Steurer on the positive semidefinite extension complexity of the correlation and TSP polytopes cannot be improved further by showing better sum-of-squares degree lower bounds on $\ell_1$-approximation of $f_k$; (2) a proof that Grigoriev's lower bound on the degree of Positivstellensatz refutations for the knapsack problem is optimal, answering an open question from his work; (3) bounds on the query complexity of quantum algorithms whose expected output approximates such functions."
1292,1601.01744,2016,1,22,13,Performance of QAOA on Typical Instances of Constraint Satisfaction Problems with Bounded Degree,Cedric Yen-Yu Lin;Yechao Zhu,"We consider constraint satisfaction problems of bounded degree, with a good notion of ""typicality"", e.g. the negation of the variables in each constraint is taken independently at random. Using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we show that $ \mu+\Omega(1/\sqrt{D}) $ fraction of the constraints can be satisfied for typical instances, with the assignment efficiently produced by QAOA. We do so by showing that the averaged fraction of constraints being satisfied is $ \mu+\Omega(1/\sqrt{D}) $, with small variance. Here $ \mu $ is the fraction that would be satisfied by a uniformly random assignment, and $ D $ is the number of constraints that each variable can appear. CSPs with typicality include Max-$ k $XOR and Max-$ k $SAT. We point out how it can be applied to determine the typical ground-state energy of some local Hamiltonians. We also give a similar result for instances with ""no overlapping constraints"", using the quantum algorithm. We sketch how the classical algorithm might achieve some partial result."

We use a programmable array of superconducting qubits to compute the energy surface of molecular hydrogen using two distinct quantum algorithms. First, we experimentally execute the unitary coupled cluster method using the variational quantum eigensolver. Our efficient implementation predicts the correct dissociation energy to within chemical accuracy of the numerically exact result. Next, we experimentally demonstrate the canonical quantum algorithm for chemistry, which consists of Trotterization and quantum phase estimation. We compare the experimental performance of these approaches to show clear evidence that the variational quantum eigensolver is robust to certain errors, inspiring hope that quantum simulation of classically intractable molecules may be viable in the near future."

Here we present a simple method for building LHV models, applicable to general entangled states, which consists in verifying that the statistics resulting from a finite set of measurements is local, a much simpler problem. This leads to a sequence of tests which, in the limit, fully capture the set of quantum states admitting a LHV model. Similar methods are developed for constructing local hidden state models. We illustrate the practical relevance of these methods with several examples, and discuss further applications."

We not only make the process efficient, but also dramatically reduce the memory required relative to conventional methods by combining rejection sampling with particle filtering. We also provide an approximate form of rejection sampling that makes rejection filtering tractable in cases where exact rejection sampling is not efficient. Finally, we present several numerical examples of rejection filtering that show its ability to track time dependent parameters in online settings and also benchmark its performance on MNIST classification problems."

In the quantum setting one must take into account the quantum side information held by an adversary which might be used to break the security of the extractor. In the case of seeded extractors the presence of quantum side information has been extensively studied. For multi-source extractors one can easily see that high conditional min-entropy is not sufficient to guarantee security against arbitrary side information, even in the classical case. Hence, the interesting question is under which models of (both quantum and classical) side information multi-source extractors remain secure. In this work we suggest a natural model of side information, which we call the Markov model, and prove that any multi-source extractor remains secure in the presence of quantum side information of this type (albeit with weaker parameters). This improves on previous results in which more restricted models were considered and the security of only some types of extractors was shown."

There have been several claims that these schemes support interpreting the quantum state as an objective property of a single quantum system. Here we provide three counter-arguments, each of which we present in two versions tailored to the two different schemes. Our first argument shows that the same resources used in protective measurement can be used to reconstruct the quantum state in a different way via process tomography. Our second argument is based on exact analyses of special cases of protective measurement, and our final argument is to construct explicit ""$\psi$-epistemic"" toy models for protective measurement, which strongly suggest that protective measurement does not imply the reality of the quantum state. The common theme of the three arguments is that almost all of the information comes from the ""protection"" operation rather than the quantum state of the system, and hence the schemes have no implications for the reality of the quantum state."

Quantum repeaters, as a promising approach, can overcome both photon loss and operation errors, and hence significantly speedup the communication rate. Depending on the methods used to correct loss and operation errors, all the proposed QR schemes can be classified into three categories (generations). Here we present the first systematic comparison of three generations of quantum repeaters by evaluating the cost of both temporal and physical resources, and identify the optimized quantum repeater architecture for a given set of experimental parameters. Our work provides a roadmap for the experimental realizations of highly efficient quantum networks over transcontinental distances."

But work, heat, and entropy impact the small scales that experimentalists can increasingly control, e.g., in single-molecule experiments. The statistical mechanics of small scales has been quantified with two toolkits developed in quantum information theory: resource theories and one-shot information theory. The field has boomed recently, but the theorems amassed have hardly impacted experiments. Can thermodynamic resource theories be realized experimentally? Via what steps can we shift the theory toward physical realizations? Should we care? I present eleven opportunities in physically realizing thermodynamic resource theories."

While MQC has inspired wide-ranging discoveries throughout quantum information, our understanding of the general principles underlying MQC seems to be biased by its historical reliance upon the archetypal 2D cluster state. Here, we utilize recent advances in the subject of symmetry-protected topological order (SPTO) to introduce a novel MQC resource state, whose physical and computational behavior differs fundamentally from the cluster state. We show that, in sharp contrast to the cluster state, our state enables universal quantum computation using only measurements of single-qubit Pauli X, Y, and Z operators. This novel computational feature is related to the ""genuine"" 2D SPTO possessed by our state, and which is absent in the cluster state. Our concrete connection between the latent computational complexity of many-body systems and macroscopic quantum orders may find applications in quantum many-body simulation for benchmarking classically intractable complexity."

However, this algorithm is known to run in optimal time only for a handful of graphs. In this work, we prove that for Erdös-Renyi random graphs, i.e.\ graphs of $n$ vertices where each edge exists with probability $p$, search by CTQW is \textitalmost surely optimal as long as $p\geq \log^{3/2}(n)/n$. Consequently, we show that quantum spatial search is in fact optimal for \emphalmost all graphs, meaning that the fraction of graphs of $n$ vertices for which this optimality holds tends to one in the asymptotic limit. We obtain this result by proving that search is optimal on graphs where the ratio between the second largest and the largest eigenvalue is bounded by a constant smaller than 1. Finally, we show that we can extend our results on search to establish high fidelity quantum communication between two arbitrary nodes of a random network of interacting qubits, namely to perform quantum state transfer, as well as entanglement generation. Our work shows that quantum information tasks typically designed for structured systems retain performance in very disordered structures."

The question of whether concordant computation always admits efficient simulation by a classical computer was first considered by B. Eastin in quant-ph/1006.4402v1, where an answer in the affirmative was given for circuits consisting only of one- and two-qubit gates. Building on this work, we develop the theory of classical simulation of concordant computation. We present a new framework for understanding such computations, argue that a larger class of concordant computations admit efficient simulation, and provide alternative proofs for the main results of quant-ph/1006.4402v1 with an emphasis on the exactness of simulation which is crucial for this model. We include detailed analysis of the arithmetic complexity for solving equations in the simulation, as well as extensions to larger gates and qudits. We explore the limitations of our approach, and discuss the challenges faced in developing efficient classical simulation algorithms for all concordant computations."

Otherwise, the so-called detection loophole could be exploited. The only way to avoid this is to have detection efficiencies that are above a certain threshold. We introduce the intermediate assumption of limited detection efficiency, e.g. in each run of the experiment the overall detection efficiency is lower bounded by $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an adversarial scenario, the adversaries have arbitrary large but not full control over the inefficiencies. We analyze the set of possible correlations that fulfil Limited Detection Locality (LDL) and show that they necessarily satisfy some linear Bell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts violation of one of these inequalities for all $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, nonlocality can be demonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection efficiencies. Finally we propose a generalized scheme that uses this characterization to deal with detection inefficiencies, which interpolates between the two usual schemes, postselection and outcome assignment."

Within quantum mechanics, however, time is not usually treated as an observable quantity; it enters merely as a parameter in the laws of motion of physical systems. Here we take an operational approach to time. Towards this goal we consider quantum clocks, i.e., quantum systems that generate an observable time scale. We then study the quality of quantum clocks in terms of their ability to stay synchronised. To quantify this, we introduce the ""Alternate Ticks Game"" and analyse a few strategies pertinent to this game."

As in the first paper of this series (arXiv:1506.01020), we employ a recently developed technique for simulating Hamiltonian evolution using a truncated Taylor series to obtain logarithmic scaling with the inverse of the desired precision. The algorithm of this paper involves simulation under an oracle for the sparse, first quantized representation of the Hamiltonian known as the configuration interaction (CI) matrix. We construct and query the CI matrix oracle to allow for on-the-fly computation of molecular integrals in a way that is exponentially more efficient than classical numerical methods. Whereas second quantized representations of the wavefunction require $\widetilde{\cal O}(N)$ qubits, where $N$ is the number of single-particle spin-orbitals, the CI matrix representation requires $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta)$ qubits where $\eta \ll N$ is the number of electrons in the molecule of interest. We show that the gate count of our algorithm scales at most as $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta^2 N^3 t)$."

We remedy the situation by providing these exponents for a variety of protocols including those at the top of the family tree of protocols. Our line of attack is to provide an exponential bound on the decoupling error for a restricted class of completely positive maps where a key term in the exponent is in terms of a Rényi \alpha-information-theoretic quantity for any \alpha $\in$ (1,2]. Among the protocols covered are fully quantum Slepian-Wolf, quantum state merging, quantum state redistribution, quantum/classical communication across channels with side information at the transmitter with or without entanglement assistance, and quantum communication across broadcast channels."

Rev. Lett. 108, 100402 (2012). These SOS decompositions provide tight upper bounds on the maximal quantum value of these Bell expressions. Moreover, they establish algebraic relations that are necessarily satisfied by any quantum state and observables yielding the optimal quantum value. These algebraic relations are then used to show that the tilted CHSH expressions provide robust self-tests for any partially entangled two-qubit state. This application to self-testing follows closely the approach of Phys. Rev. A 87, 050102 (2013), where we identify and correct two non-trivial flaws."

Postselection can be useful in many applications where the cost of getting the wrong event is implicitly high. However, unless this cost is specified exactly, one might conclude that discarding all data is optimal. Here we analyze the optimal decision rules and quantum measurements in a decision theoretic setting where a prespecified cost is assigned to discarding data. Our scheme interpolates between unambiguous state discrimination (when the cost of postselection is zero) and a minimum error measurement (when the cost of postselection is maximal). We also relate our formulation to previous approaches which focus on minimizing the probability of indecision."

These are employed to devise adaptive sequential sampling procedures that guarantee recovery of the true matrix in Frobenius norm after a data-driven stopping time $\hat n$ for the number of measurements that have to be taken. With high probability, this stopping time is minimax optimal. We detail applications to quantum tomography problems where measurements arise from Pauli observables. We also give a theoretical construction of a confidence set for the density matrix of a quantum state that has optimal diameter in nuclear norm. The non-asymptotic properties of our confidence sets are further investigated in a simulation study."

We show that the modification to the entropic area law due to three-dimensional topological properties is richer than the two-dimensional case. In addition to the reduction of the entropy caused by non-zero vacuum expectation value of contractible loop operators a new topological invariant appears that increases the entropy if the model consists of non-trivially braiding anyons. As a result the three-dimensional topological entanglement entropy provides only partial information about the two entropic topological invariants.

The toy theory is phrased in the language of the circuit model for quantum computing, its key ingredient being a limitation on the number of interactions that \textiteach qubit may undergo. As long as one stays in the circuit model, the toy theory is consistent and may even match what we shall be ever able to do in a controlled laboratory experiment. The direct extension of the restriction beyond the circuit model conflicts with observed facts: the possibility of restricting the complexity of quantum state, while saving phenomena, remains an open question."
1313,1503.06413,2015,3,31,13,Causarum Investigatio and the Two Bell's Theorems of John Bell,Howard M Wiseman;Eric G Cavalcanti,"""Bell's theorem"" can refer to two different theorems that John Bell proved, the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His 1964 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the joint assumptions of Locality and Predetermination. His 1976 theorem is their incompatibility with the single property of Local Causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions, that his 1964 theorem began with the assumption of Local Causality, even if not by that name. Although the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions are not. Hence, the earlier and later theorems suggest quite different conclusions, embraced by operationalists and realists, respectively. The key issue is whether Locality or Local Causality is the appropriate notion emanating from Relativistic Causality, and this rests on one's basic notion of causation. For operationalists the appropriate notion is what is here called the Principle of Agent-Causation, while for realists it is Reichenbach's Principle of common cause. By breaking down the latter into even more basic Postulates, it is possible to obtain a version of Bell's theorem in which each camp could reject one assumption, happy that the remaining assumptions reflect its weltanschauung. Formulating Bell's theorem in terms of causation is fruitful not just for attempting to reconcile the two camps, but also for better describing the ontology of different quantum interpretations and for more deeply understanding the implications of Bell's marvellous work."

In this work, we show that if we bind a 1D representation of the symmetry (such as a charge) to the intersection point of several domain walls, condensing such modified domain-walls can lead to a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state. This result is obtained by showing that the modified domain-wall condensed state has a non-trivial SPT invariant -- the symmetry-twist dependent partition function. We propose two different kinds of field theories that can describe the above mentioned SPT states. The first one is a Ginzburg-Landau-type non-linear sigma model theory, but with an additional multi-kink domain-wall topological term. Such theory has an anomalous $U^k(1)$ symmetry but an anomaly-free $Z_N^k$ symmetry. The second one is a gauge theory, which is beyond Abelian Chern-Simons/BF gauge theories. We argue that the two field theories are equivalent at low energies. After coupling to the symmetry twists, both theories produce the desired SPT invariant."

We propose an algebraic bound to the quantum value of these games and use it to derive several interesting properties of these games. As an example, we re-derive in a simple manner a recently discovered bound on the quantum value of the CHSH-d game for prime $d$. It is shown that no total function XOR-d game with uniform inputs can be a pseudo-telepathy game, there exists a quantum strategy to win the game only when there is a classical strategy also. We then study the principle of lack of quantum advantage in the distributed non-local computation of binary functions which is a well-known information-theoretic principle designed to pick out quantum correlations from amongst general no-signaling ones. We prove a large-alphabet generalization of this principle, showing that quantum theory provides no advantage in the task of non-local distributed computation of a restricted class of functions with $d$ outcomes for prime $d$, while general no-signaling boxes do. Finally, we consider the question whether there exist two-party tight Bell inequalities with no quantum advantage, and show that the binary non-local computation game inequalities for the restricted class of functions are not facet defining for any number of inputs."

To classically simulate the time evolution of the system with a limited amount of entanglement, we represent the quantum state using matrix-product states and projected entangled-pair states. We show that the probability of finding the ground state of an Ising spin glass on either a planar or non-planar two-dimensional graph increases rapidly as the amount of entanglement in the state is increased. Furthermore, we propose evolution in complex time as a way to improve simulated adiabatic evolution and mimic the effects of thermal cooling of the quantum annealer."

Previous literature on the subject has just focused on transformations between different state resources, overlooking the fact that quantum operations which do not commute with the total energy also constitute a potentially valuable resource. In this Letter, given a number of non-thermal quantum channels, we study the problem of how to integrate them in a thermal engine so as to distill a maximum amount of work. We find that, in the limit of asymptotically many uses of each channel, the distillable work is an additive function of the considered channels, computable for both finite dimensional quantum operations and bosonic channels. We apply our results to bound the amount of distillable work due to the natural non-thermal processes postulated in the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) collapse model. We find that, although GRW theory predicts the possibility to extract work from the vacuum at no cost, the power which a \emphcollapse engine could in principle generate is extremely low."

The main part of the paper addresses a fundamental question: Is ER=EPR consistent with the standard postulates of quantum mechanics? Naively it seems to lead to an inconsistency between observations made on entangled systems by different observers. The resolution of the paradox lies in the properties of multiple black holes, entangled in the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger pattern. The last part of the paper is about entanglement as a resource for quantum communication. ER=EPR provides a way to visualize protocols like quantum teleportation. In some sense teleportation takes place through the wormhole, but as usual, classical communication is necessary to complete the protocol."

States that are far from being stabilizer states include magic states in quantum computation, MUB-balanced states, and SIC vectors. In prime dimensions the latter two fall under the umbrella of Minimum Uncertainty States (MUS) in the sense of Wootters and Sussman. We study the correlation between two ways in which the notion of ""far from being a stabilizer state"" can be quantified, and give detailed results for low dimensions. In dimension 7 we identify the MUB-balanced states as being antipodal to the SIC vectors within the set of MUS, in a sense that we make definite. In dimension 4 we show that the states that come closest to being MUS with respect to all the six stabilizer MUBs are the fiducial vectors for Alltop MUBs."

In this work, we examine the consequences of one such conjecture on the combinatorics of 3-manifold diagrams. We use basic tools from quantum computation to give a simple (and unconditional) proof that the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of 3-manifolds is $\#$P-hard to calculate. We then use this fact to show that, if NP $\neq \#$P, then there exist infinitely many 3-manifold diagrams which cannot be made logarithmically ""thin"" (relative to their overall size) except perhaps by an exponentially large number of local moves. The latter theorem is an analogue of a result of Freedman for the Jones Polynomial."

Current methods for classifying measurement trajectories in superconducting qubit systems produce fidelities that are systematically lower than those predicted by experimental parameters. Here, we place current classification methods within the framework of machine learning algorithms and improve on them by investigating more sophisticated ML approaches. We find that non-linear algorithms and clustering methods produce significantly higher assignment fidelities that help close the gap to the fidelity achievable under ideal noise conditions. Clustering methods group trajectories into natural subsets within the data, which allows for the diagnosis of specific systematic errors. We find large clusters in the data associated with relaxation processes and show these are the main source of discrepancy between our experimental and achievable fidelities. These error diagnosis techniques help provide a concrete path forward to improve qubit measurements."

Perfectly secure bit commitment between two mistrustful parties is impossible through asynchronous exchange of quantum information. Perfect security is however possible when Alice and Bob each split into several agents exchanging classical information at times and locations suitably chosen to satisfy specific relativistic constraints. In this Letter we first revisit a previously proposed scheme that realizes bit commitment using only classical communication. We prove that the protocol is secure against quantum adversaries for a duration limited by the light-speed communication time between the locations of the agents. We then propose a novel multi-round scheme based on finite-field arithmetic that extends the commitment time beyond this limit, and we prove its security against classical attacks. Finally, we present an implementation of these protocols using dedicated hardware and we show how it could be used to realize commitments of duration ranging up to 212 milliseconds by agents occupying antipodal locations on the Earth."

This is a problem of technological relevance for the reading of information stored in a digital memory. In our setting, a coherent light source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known, but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many copies of the same coherent state. We show that an optimal global measurement, performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal. By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the case even for non-Gaussian estimation measurements. Our results show that, even in absence of entanglement, collective quantum measurements yield an enhancement in the readout of classical information, which is particularly relevant in the operating regime of low-energy signals."

We present a definition of the topological symmetry group, which characterizes the symmetry of the emergent topological quantum numbers of a topological phase $\mathcal{C}$, and we describe its relation with the microscopic symmetry of the underlying physical system. We derive a general framework to classify symmetry fractionalization in topological phases, including phases that are non-Abelian and symmetries that permute the quasiparticle types and/or are anti-unitary. We develop a theory of extrinsic defects (fluxes) associated with elements of the symmetry group, which provides a general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases derived from a topological phase of matter $\mathcal{C}$ with symmetry group $G$. The algebraic theory of the defects, known as a $G$-crossed braided tensor category $\mathcal{C}_{G}^{\times}$, allows one to compute many properties, such as the number of topologically distinct types of defects associated with each group element, their fusion rules, quantum dimensions, zero modes, braiding exchange transformations, a generalized Verlinde formula for the defects, and modular transformations of the $G$-crossed extensions of topological phases. We also examine the promotion of the global symmetry to a local gauge invariance, wherein the extrinsic $G$-defects are turned into deconfined quasiparticle excitations, which results in a different topological phase $\mathcal{C}/G$. A number of instructive and/or physically relevant examples are studied in detail."

Direct transmission of quantum signals over long distances is prevented by fibre attenuation and the no-cloning theorem, motivating the development of quantum repeaters, designed to purify entanglement, extending its range. Quantum repeaters have been demonstrated over short distances, but error-corrected, global repeater networks with high bandwidth require new technology. Here we show that error corrected quantum memories installed in cargo containers and carried by ship can provide a flexible connection between local networks, enabling low-latency, high-fidelity quantum communication across global distances at higher bandwidths than previously proposed. With demonstrations of technology with sufficient fidelity to enable topological error-correction, implementation of the quantum memories is within reach, and bandwidth increases with improvements in fabrication. Our approach to quantum networking avoids technological restrictions of repeater deployment, providing an alternate path to a worldwide Quantum Internet."

They act only on those vectors in Hilbert space whose entries belong to some chosen number field. For Mutually Unbiased Bases the relevant number field is a cyclotomic field. By including Galois unitaries we are able to remove a mismatch between the finite projective group acting on the bases on the one hand, and the set of those permutations of the bases that can be implemented as transformations in Hilbert space on the other hand. In particular we show that there exist transformations that cycle through all the bases in every dimension which is an odd power of an odd prime. (For even primes unitary MUB-cyclers exist.) These transformations have eigenvectors, which are MUB-balanced states (i.e. rotationally symmetric states in the original terminology of Wootters and Sussman) if and only if d = 3 modulo 4. We conjecture that this construction yields all such states in odd prime power dimension."

It has a gate error threshold of $0.75% and only requires nearest-neighbor interactions on a 2D array of qubits. Previous work on loss tolerance using this code only considered qubits vanishing during measurement. We begin by also including qubit loss during two-qubit gates and initialization, and then additionally consider interaction errors that occur when neighbors attempt to entangle with a qubit that isn't there. In doing so, we show that even our best case scenario requires a loss rate below 1% in order to avoid considerable space-time overhead."

As these devices become larger and more complex, the ability to design them such that they can be simply controlled becomes a daunting and computationally infeasible task. Here, motivated by ideas from compressed sensing, we introduce a protocol for the Compressed Optimization of Device Architectures (CODA). It leads naturally to a metric for benchmarking device performance and optimizing device designs, and provides a scheme for automating the control of gate operations and reducing their complexity. Because CODA is computationally efficient, it is readily extensible to large systems. We demonstrate the CODA benchmarking and optimization protocols through simulations of up to eight quantum dots in devices that are currently being developed experimentally for quantum computation."

This is important for tasks such as image and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing applications in the IT industry. In the last couple of years, researchers investigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine learning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms or their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of stochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives a systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It presents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessable way, and discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning."
1330,1408.6410,2014,9,11,13,The multi-mode quantum Entropy Power Inequality,Giacomo De Palma;Andrea Mari;Seth Lloyd;Vittorio Giovannetti,"The quantum version of a fundamental entropic data-processing inequality is presented. It establishes a lower bound for the entropy that can be generated in the output channels of a scattering process, which involves a collection of independent input bosonic modes (e.g., the modes of the electromagnetic field). The impact of this inequality in quantum information theory is potentially large and some relevant implications are considered in this work."

In particular, we show that the Matrix Product State Transfer Matrix (MPS-TM) - a central object in the computation of static correlation functions - provides important information about the location and magnitude of the minima of the low energy dispersion relation(s) and present supporting numerical data for one-dimensional lattice and continuum models as well as two-dimensional lattice models on a cylinder. We elaborate on the peculiar structure of the MPS-TM's eigenspectrum and give several arguments for the close relation between the structure of the low energy spectrum of the system and the form of static correlation functions. Finally, we discuss how the MPS-TM connects to the exact Quantum Transfer Matrix (QTM) of the model at zero temperature. We present a renormalization group argument for obtaining finite bond dimension approximations of MPS, which allows to reinterpret variational MPS techniques (such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group) as an application of Wilson's Numerical Renormalization Group along the virtual (imaginary time) dimension of the system."
1332,1408.3373,2014,8,25,13,Strong converse exponents for a quantum channel discrimination problem and quantum-feedback-assisted communication,Tom Cooney;Milán Mosonyi;Mark M Wilde,"This paper studies the difficulty of discriminating between an arbitrary quantum channel and a ""replacer"" channel that discards its input and replaces it with a fixed state. We show that, in this particular setting, the most general adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over non-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a quantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a constant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to zero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy registered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states that any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than the channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily converges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal strong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we can establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted capacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our channel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a non-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as was used in prior work on the topic. The sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is a key tool in our analysis. Finally, by combining our results with recent results of Hayashi and Tomamichel, we find a novel operational interpretation of the mutual information of a quantum channel N as the optimal type II error exponent when discriminating between a large number of independent instances of N and an arbitrary ""worst-case"" replacer channel chosen from the set of all replacer channels."
1333,1407.8203,2014,8,15,13,Renormalization group constructions of topological quantum liquids and beyond,Brian Swingle;John McGreevy,"We give a detailed physical argument for the area law for entanglement entropy in gapped phases of matter arising from local Hamiltonians. Our approach is based on renormalization group (RG) ideas and takes a resource oriented perspective. We report four main results. First, we argue for the ""weak area law"": any gapped phase with a unique ground state on every closed manifold obeys the area law. Second, we introduce an RG based classification scheme and give a detailed argument that all phases within the classification scheme obey the area law. Third, we define a special sub-class of gapped phases, \textittopological quantum liquids, which captures all examples of current physical relevance, and we rigorously show that TQLs obey an area law. Fourth, we show that all topological quantum liquids have MERA representations which achieve unit overlap with the ground state in the thermodynamic limit and which have a bond dimension scaling with system size $L$ as $e^{c \log^{d(1+\delta)}(L)}$ for all $\delta >0$. For example, we show that chiral phases in $d=2$ dimensions have an approximate MERA with bond dimension $e^{c \log^{2(1+\delta)}(L)}$. We discuss extensively a number of subsidiary ideas and results necessary to make the main arguments, including field theory constructions. While our argument for the general area law rests on physically-motived assumptions (which we make explicit) and is therefore not rigorous, we may conclude that ""conventional"" gapped phases obey the area law and that any gapped phase which violates the area law must be a dragon."
1334,1407.7765,2014,8,1,13,Extractable Work from Correlations,Martí Perarnau-Llobet;Karen V Hovhannisyan;Marcus Huber;Paul Skrzypczyk;Nicolas Brunner;Antonio Acín,"Work and quantum correlations are two fundamental resources in thermodynamics and quantum information theory. In this work we study how to use correlations among quantum systems to optimally store work. We analyse this question for isolated quantum ensembles, where the work can be naturally divided into two contributions: a local contribution from each system, and a global contribution originating from correlations among systems. We focus on the latter and consider quantum systems which are locally thermal, thus from which any extractable work can only come from correlations. We compute the maximum extractable work for general entangled states, separable states, and states with fixed entropy. Our results show that while entanglement gives an advantage for small quantum ensembles, this gain vanishes for a large number of systems."
1335,1407.6616,2014,7,30,13,Second order asymptotics of visible mixed quantum source coding via universal codes,Felix Leditzky;Nilanjana Datta,"The simplest example of a quantum information source with memory is a mixed source which emits signals entirely from one of two memoryless quantum sources with given a priori probabilities. Considering a mixed source consisting of a general one-parameter family of memoryless sources, we derive the second order asymptotic rate for fixed-length visible source coding. Furthermore, we specialize our main result to a mixed source consisting of two memoryless sources. Our results provide the first example of second order asymptotics for a quantum information-processing task employing a resource with memory. For the case of a classical mixed source (using a finite alphabet), our results reduce to those obtained by Nomura and Han [IEEE Trans. on Inf. Th. 59.1 (2013), pp. 1-16]. To prove the achievability part of our main result, we introduce universal quantum source codes achieving second order asymptotic rates. These are obtained by an extension of Hayashi's construction [IEEE Trans. on Inf. Th. 54.10 (2008), pp. 4619-4637] of their classical counterparts."

Specifically, we briefly review the effect of symmetries in TN states, fermionic TNs, the calculation of entanglement Hamiltonians from Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), and the relation between the Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) and the AdS/CFT or gauge/gravity duality. We stress the role played by entanglement in the emergence of several physical properties and objects through the TN language. Some recent results along these lines are also discussed."
1337,1407.5507,2014,7,25,13,Nonzero Classical Discord,Vlad Gheorghiu;Marcos C de Oliveira;Barry C Sanders,"Quantum discord is the quantitative difference between two alternative expressions for bipartite mutual information, given respectively in terms of two distinct definitions for the conditional entropy. By constructing a stochastic model of shared states, classical discord can be similarly defined, quantifying the presence of some stochasticity in the measurement process. Therefore, discord can generally be understood as a quantification of the system's state disturbance due to local measurements, be it quantum or classical. We establish an operational meaning of classical discord in the context of state merging with noisy measurement and thereby show the quantum-classical separation in terms of a negative conditional entropy."
1338,1407.1361,2014,7,22,13,Classical simulation of Yang-Baxter gates,Gorjan Alagic;Aniruddha Bapat;Stephen P Jordan,"A unitary operator that satisfies the constant Yang-Baxter equation immediately yields a unitary representation of the braid group B n for every $n \ge 2$. If we view such an operator as a quantum-computational gate, then topological braiding corresponds to a quantum circuit. A basic question is when such a representation affords universal quantum computation. In this work, we show how to classically simulate these circuits when the gate in question belongs to certain families of solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. These include all of the qubit (i.e., $d = 2$) solutions, and some simple families that include solutions for arbitrary $d \ge 2$. Our main tool is a probabilistic classical algorithm for efficient simulation of a more general class of quantum circuits. This algorithm may be of use outside the present setting."
1339,1406.4101,2014,7,8,13,Self-guided quantum tomography,Christopher Ferrie,We introduce a self-learning tomographic technique in which the experiment guides itself to an estimate of its own state. Self-guided quantum tomography (SGQT) uses measurements to directly test hypotheses in an iterative algorithm which converges to the true state. We demonstrate through simulation on many qubits that SGQT is a more efficient and robust alternative to the usual paradigm of taking a large amount of informationally complete data and solving the inverse problem of post-processed state estimation.

With any such game, we associate a graph and examine its zero-error communication capacity. This allows us to specify a broad new class of graphs for which the Shannon capacity can be calculated. The conditions also enable the parametrisation of new families of games which have no quantum advantage, for arbitrary input probability distributions up to certain symmetries. In the future, these might be used in information-theoretic studies on reproducing the set of quantum non-local correlations."
1341,1405.7321,2014,6,5,13,Local hidden--variable models for entangled quantum states,Remigiusz Augusiak;Maciej Demianowicz;Antonio Acín,"While entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities were initially thought to be equivalent quantum phenomena, we now have different examples of entangled states whose correlations can be described by local hidden--variable models and, therefore, do not violate any Bell inequality. We provide an up to date overview of the existing local hidden--variable models for entangled quantum states, both in the bipartite and multipartite case, and discuss some of the most relevant open questions in this context. Our review covers twenty five years of this line of research since the seminal work by Werner [R. F. Werner, Phys. Rev. A 40, 8 (1989)] providing the first example of an entangled state with a local model, which in turn appeared twenty five years after the seminal work by Bell [J. S. Bell, Physics 1, 195 (1964)], about the impossibility of recovering the predictions of quantum mechanics using a local hidden--variables theory."
1342,1405.2502,2014,5,29,13,Maximal Entanglement - A New Measure of Entanglement,Salman Beigi,"Maximal correlation is a measure of correlation for bipartite distributions. This measure has two intriguing features: (1) it is monotone under local stochastic maps; (2) it gives the same number when computed on i.i.d. copies of a pair of random variables. This measure of correlation has recently been generalized for bipartite quantum states, for which the same properties have been proved. In this paper, based on maximal correlation, we define a new measure of entanglement which we call maximal entanglement. We show that this measure of entanglement is faithful (is zero on separable states and positive on entangled states), is monotone under local quantum operations, and gives the same number when computed on tensor powers of a bipartite state."
1343,1405.0348,2014,5,13,13,Numerical Techniques for Finding the Distances of Quantum Codes,Ilya Dumer;Alexey A Kovalev;Leonid P Pryadko,"We survey the existing techniques for calculating code distances of classical codes and apply these techniques to generic quantum codes. For classical and quantum LDPC codes, we also present a new linked-cluster technique. It reduces complexity exponent of all existing deterministic techniques designed for codes with small relative distances (which include all known families of quantum LDPC codes), and also surpasses the probabilistic technique for sufficiently high code rates."
1344,1404.7516,2014,5,5,13,Classical leakage resilience from fault-tolerant quantum computation,Felipe G Lacerda;Joseph M Renes;Renato Renner,"Physical implementations of cryptographic algorithms leak information, which makes them vulnerable to so-called side-channel attacks. The problem of secure computation in the presence of leakage is generally known as leakage resilience. In this work, we establish a connection between leakage resilience and fault-tolerant quantum computation. We first prove that for a general leakage model, there exists a corresponding noise model in which fault tolerance implies leakage resilience. Then we show how to use constructions for fault-tolerant quantum computation to implement classical circuits that are secure in specific leakage models."
1345,1404.3225,2014,5,1,13,The best Fisher is upstream: data processing inequalities for quantum metrology,Christopher Ferrie,"We apply the classical data processing inequality to quantum metrology to show that manipulating the classical information from a quantum measurement cannot aid in the estimation of parameters encoded in quantum states. We further derive a quantum data processing inequality to show that coherent manipulation of quantum data also cannot improve the precision in estimation. In addition, we comment on the assumptions necessary to arrive at these inequalities and how they might be avoided providing insights into enhancement procedures which are not provably wrong."
1346,1403.4687,2014,4,15,13,Equivalence of wave-particle duality to entropic uncertainty,Patrick J Coles;Jędrzej Kaniewski;Stephanie Wehner,"Interferometers capture a basic mystery of quantum mechanics: a single particle can exhibit wave behavior, yet that wave behavior disappears when one tries to determine the particle's path inside the interferometer. This idea has been formulated quantitively as an inequality, e.g., by Englert and Jaeger, Shimony, and Vaidman, which upper bounds the sum of the interference visibility and the path distinguishability. Such wave-particle duality relations (WPDRs) are often thought to be conceptually inequivalent to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, although this has been debated. Here we show that WPDRs correspond precisely to a modern formulation of the uncertainty principle in terms of entropies, namely the min- and max-entropies. This observation unifies two fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it leads to a robust framework for deriving novel WPDRs by applying entropic uncertainty relations to interferometric models. As an illustration, we derive a novel relation that captures the coherence in a quantum beam splitter."
1347,1403.4643,2014,3,20,13,Information Content of Systems as a Physical Principle,Lukasz Czekaj;Michał Horodecki;Paweł Horodecki;Ryszard Horodecki,"To explain conceptual gap between classical/quantum and other, hypothetical descriptions of world, several principles has been proposed. So far, all these principles have not involved uncertainty concept. Here we introduce an information content principle (ICP) which represents the new - constrained uncertainty principle. The principle, by taking into account the encoding/decoding properties of physical system, is capable of separation both classicality and quanta from a number of potential physical theories including hidden variable theories. The ICP, which is satisfied by both classical and quantum theory, states that the amount of non-redundant information which may be extracted from a given system is bounded by a perfectly decodable information content of the system. We show that ICP allows to discriminate theories which do not allow for correlations stronger than Tsirelson's bound. We show also how to apply the principle to composite systems, ruling out some theories despite their elementary constituents behave quantumly."
1348,1403.4147,2014,3,20,13,Higher-order interference and single-system postulates characterizing quantum theory,Howard Barnum;Markus P Müller;Cozmin Ududec,"We present a new characterization of quantum theory in terms of simple physical principles that is different from previous ones in two important respects: first, it only refers to properties of single systems without any assumptions on the composition of many systems; and second, it is closer to experiment by having absence of higher-order interference as a postulate, which is currently the subject of experimental investigation. We give three postulates -- no higher-order interference, classical decomposability of states, and strong symmetry -- and prove that the only non-classical operational probabilistic theories satisfying them are real, complex, and quaternionic quantum theory, together with 3-level octonionic quantum theory and ball state spaces of arbitrary dimension. Then we show that adding observability of energy as a fourth postulate yields complex quantum theory as the unique solution, relating the emergence of the complex numbers to the possibility of Hamiltonian dynamics. We also show that there may be interesting non-quantum theories satisfying only the first two of our postulates, which would allow for higher-order interference in experiments while still respecting the contextuality analogue of the local orthogonality principle."
1349,1403.1114,2014,3,18,13,Random matrices and quantum spin chains,J P Keating;Noah Linden;H J Wells,"Random matrix ensembles are introduced that respect the local tensor structure of Hamiltonians describing a chain of $n$ distinguishable spin-half particles with nearest-neighbour interactions. We prove a central limit theorem for the density of states when $n \rightarrow\infty$, giving explicit bounds on the rate of approach to the limit. Universality within a class of probability measures and the extension to more general interaction geometries are established. The level spacing distributions of the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic Ensembles are observed numerically for the energy levels in these ensembles."

Our results are as follows: * We develop a new technique for the construction of quantum algorithms: learning graphs. * We use learning graphs to improve quantum query complexity of the triangle detection and the $k$-distinctness problems. * We prove tight lower bounds for the $k$-sum and the triangle sum problems. * We construct quantum algorithms for some subgraph-finding problems that are optimal in terms of query, time and space complexities. * We develop a generalisation of quantum walks that connects electrical properties of a graph and its quantum hitting time. We use it to construct a time-efficient quantum algorithm for 3-distinctness."
1351,1402.3067,2014,2,18,13,A Bayesian Characterization of Relative Entropy,John C Baez;Tobias Fritz,"We give a new characterization of relative entropy, also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We use a number of interesting categories related to probability theory. In particular, we consider a category FinStat where an object is a finite set equipped with a probability distribution, while a morphism is a measure-preserving function $f: X \to Y$ together with a stochastic right inverse $s: Y \to X$. The function $f$ can be thought of as a measurement process, while s provides a hypothesis about the state of the measured system given the result of a measurement. Given this data we can define the entropy of the probability distribution on $X$ relative to the ""prior"" given by pushing the probability distribution on $Y$ forwards along $s$. We say that $s$ is ""optimal"" if these distributions agree. We show that any convex linear, lower semicontinuous functor from FinStat to the additive monoid $[0,\infty]$ which vanishes when $s$ is optimal must be a scalar multiple of this relative entropy. Our proof is independent of all earlier characterizations, but inspired by the work of Petz."
1352,1402.0034,2014,2,14,13,On convex optimization problems in quantum information theory,Mark W Girard;Gilad Gour;Shmuel Friedland,"Convex optimization problems arise naturally in quantum information theory, often in terms of minimizing a convex function over a convex subset of the space of hermitian matrices. In most cases, finding exact solutions to these problems is usually impossible. As inspired by earlier investigations into the relative entropy of entanglement [Phys. Rev. A 78 032310 (2008)], we introduce a general method to solve the converse problem rather than find explicit solutions. That is, given a matrix in a convex set, we determine a family of convex functions that are minimized at this point. This method allows us find explicit formulae for the relative entropy of entanglement and the Rains bound, two well-known upper bounds on the distillable entanglement, and yields interesting information about these quantities, such as the fact that they coincide in the case where at least one subsystem of a multipartite state is a qubit."

We present two results for the entanglement negativity: a disentangling theorem, which allows the use of this entanglement measure as a means to detect whether a wave-function of three subsystems $A$, $B$, and $C$ factorizes into a product state for parts $AB_1$ and $B_2C$; and a monogamy relation, which states that if $A$ is very entangled with $B$, then $A$ cannot be simultaneaously very entangled also with $C$."
1354,1401.3820,2014,1,24,13,Quantum circuit complexity of one-dimensional topological phases,Yichen Huang;Xie Chen,"Topological quantum states cannot be created from product states with local quantum circuits of constant depth and are in this sense more entangled than topologically trivial states, but how entangled are they? Here we quantify the entanglement in one-dimensional topological states by showing that local quantum circuits of linear depth are necessary to generate them from product states. We establish this linear lower bound for both bosonic and fermionic one-dimensional topological phases and use symmetric circuits for phases with symmetry. We also show that the linear lower bound can be saturated by explicitly constructing circuits generating these topological states. The same results hold for local quantum circuits connecting topological states in different phases."
1355,1401.1523,2014,1,17,13,Firewalls and flat mirrors: An alternative to the AMPS experiment which evades the Harlow-Hayden obstacle,Jonathan Oppenheim;William G Unruh,"If quantum gravity does not lead to a breakdown of predictability, then Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski and Sully (AMPS) have argued that an observer falling into a black hole can perform an experiment which verifies a violation of entanglement monogamy - that late time Hawking radiation is maximally entangled with early time Hawking radiation and also with infalling radiation - something impossible in quantum field theory. However, as pointed out by Hayden and Harlow, this experiment is infeasible, as the time required to perform the experiment is almost certainly longer than the lifetime of the black hole. Here we propose an alternative firewall experiment which could actually be performed within the black hole's lifetime. The alternative experiment involves forming an entangled black hole in which the unscrambling of information is precomputed on a quantum memory prior to the creation of the black hole and without acting on the matter which forms the black hole or emerges from it. This would allow an observer near a black hole to signal faster than light. As another application of our precomputing strategy, we show how one can produce entangled black holes which acts like ``flat mirrors'', in the sense that information comes out almost instantly (as in the Hayden-Preskill scenario), but also emerge unscrambled, so that it can actually be observed instantly as well. Finally, we prove that a black hole in thermal equilibrium with its own radiation, is uncorrelated with this radiation."

To this end, we define matrix product state manifolds which are manifestly gauge invariant. As an application, we study 1+1 dimensional one flavour quantum electrodynamics, also known as the massive Schwinger model, and are able to determine very accurately the ground state properties and elementary one-particle excitations in the continuum limit. In particular, a novel particle excitation in the form of a heavy vector boson is uncovered, compatible with the strong coupling expansion in the continuum. We also study non-equilibrium dynamics by simulating the real-time evolution of the system induced by a quench in the form of a uniform background electric field."

We show that PBR's assumption of independence encodes an assumption of local causality, which is already known to conflict with the predictions of quantum theory via Bell-type inequalities. We devise a weaker formulation of independence within a general hidden variable model that is empirically indistinguishable from the PBR assumption in situations where certain hidden variables are inaccessible. Under this weaker principle we are able to construct an explicit hidden variable model that is purely statistical and also reproduces the quantum predictions. Our results suggest that the assumption of a purely statistical interpretation is actually an innocent bystander in the PBR argument, rather than the driving force behind their contradiction."

We show that for the $k$-fold product $G^k$ of the game $G$ (which represents the game $G$ played in parallel $k$ times independently), $ \omega^*(G^k) =\left(1-(1-\omega^*(G))^3\right)^{\Omega\left(\frac{k}{\log(|\mathcal{A}| \cdot |\mathcal{B}|)}\right)} $, where $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ represent the sets from which the answers of Alice and Bob are drawn."

We achieve this by adopting the viewpoint of coherence as a physical resource. By determining defining conditions for measures of coherence we identify classes of functionals that satisfy these conditions and other, at first glance natural quantities, that do not qualify as coherence measure. We conclude with an outline of the questions that remain to be answered to complete the theory of coherence as a resource."

This family includes many known relative entropies (or divergences) such as the quantum relative entropy, the recently defined quantum Rényi divergences, as well as the quantum Rényi relative entropies. All its members satisfy the quantum generalizations of Rényi's axioms for a divergence. We consider the range of the parameters $\alpha,z$ for which the data processing inequality holds. We also investigate a variety of limiting cases for the two parameters, obtaining explicit formulas for each one of them."

Contrary to previous approaches, the information-theoretic quantities we define are invariant under relabelling of outcomes, and allow for the possibility of using quantum or classical operations to `correct' for the disturbance. We also show how our bound implies strong tradeoff relations for mean square deviations."

Our construction gives interactive proofs for all languages in BQP with a polynomial number of quantum provers, each of which, in the honest case, performs only a single measurement. Our techniques use self-tested graph states. In this regard we introduce two important improvements over previous work. Specifically, we derive new error bounds which scale polynomially with the size of the graph compared with exponential dependence on the size of the graph in previous work. We also extend the self-testing error bounds on measurements to a very general set which includes the adaptive measurements used for measurement-based quantum computation as a special case."

Its main feature is that it can be solved with current linear optics technology, without the need for a full quantum computer. In this work, we investigate whether an experimentally realistic BosonSampler can really solve BosonSampling without any fault-tolerance mechanism. More precisely, we study how the unavoidable errors linked to an imperfect calibration of the optical elements affect the final result of the computation. We show that the fidelity of each optical element must be at least $1 - O(1/n^2)$, where $n$ refers to the number of single photons in the scheme. Such a requirement seems to be achievable with state-of-the-art equipment."

These codes support computationally universal sets of weight-two logical operators and are particularly well-suited for implementing dynamical decoupling error suppression. For Hamiltonians embeddable on a planar graph of fixed degree, our encoding maintains a planar connectivity graph and increase the graph degree by only two. These codes are the first known to possess these features."

This provides a method to transform every decoding algorithm of surface codes into a decoding algorithm of color codes. Applying this idea to a family of hexagonal color codes, with the perfect matching decoding algorithm for the three corresponding surface codes, we find a phase error threshold of approximately 8.7%. Finally, our approach enables us to establish a general lower bound on the error threshold of a family of color codes depending on the threshold of the three corresponding surface codes. These results are based on a chain complex interpretation of surface codes and color codes."

They are ground states of two different kinds of free-fermion Hamiltonians: (i) local and gapless; (ii) gapped, but with hopping amplitudes that decay according to a power law. We derive general conditions on topological free fermionic PEPS which show that they cannot correspond to exact ground states of gapped, local parent Hamiltonians, and provide numerical evidence demonstrating that they can nevertheless approximate well the physical properties of topological insulators with local Hamiltonians at arbitrary temperatures."

The information exclusion principle bounds instead the correlations that can exist between the outcomes of incompatible measurements on one physical system, and a second reference system. We provide a more stringent formulation of both the uncertainty principle and the information exclusion principle, with direct applications for, e.g., the security analysis of quantum key distribution, entanglement estimation, and quantum communication. We also highlight a fundamental distinction between the complementarity of observables in terms of uncertainty and in terms of information."

For Pauli and erasure channels we also present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for this communication scheme based on polar codes (essentially linear in the blocklength), but which do not require the sender and receiver to share any entanglement before the protocol begins. Due to the existence of degeneracies in the involved error-correcting codes it is indeed possible that the rate of the scheme exceeds the coherent information. We provide a simple criterion which indicates such performance. Finally we discuss how the scheme can be used for secret key distillation as well as private channel coding."

In this work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer, with complexity logarithmic in the size of the vectors and the number of training examples. In cases when classical sampling algorithms require polynomial time, an exponential speed-up is obtained. At the core of this quantum big data algorithm is a non-sparse matrix exponentiation technique for efficiently performing a matrix inversion of the training data inner-product (kernel) matrix."

(arXiv:1306.1586) and Müller-Lennert et al (arXiv:1306.3142v1). This new quantum divergence has already found applications in quantum information theory. Here we further investigate properties of this new quantum divergence. In particular we show that sandwiched $\alpha$-Rényi divergence satisfies the data processing inequality for all values of $\alpha> 1$. Moreover we prove that $\alpha$-Holevo information, a variant of Holevo information defined in terms of sandwiched $\alpha$-Rényi divergence, is super-additive. Our results are based on Hölder's inequality, the Riesz-Thorin theorem and ideas from the theory of complex interpolation. We also employ Sion's minimax theorem."

We introduce the Heisenberg picture for time-dependent local Liouvillians and state a Lieb-Robinson bound that gives rise to a maximum speed of propagation of correlations in many body systems of locally interacting spins and fermions.

1374,1302.5902,2013,4,27,13,An equality between entanglement and uncertainty,Mario Berta;Patrick J Coles;Stephanie Wehner,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle implies that if one party (Alice) prepares a system and randomly measures one of two incompatible observables, then another party (Bob) cannot perfectly predict the measurement outcomes. This implication assumes that Bob does not possess an additional system that is entangled to the measured one; indeed the seminal paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) showed that maximal entanglement allows Bob to perfectly win this guessing game. Although not in contradiction, the observations made by EPR and Heisenberg illustrate two extreme cases of the interplay between entanglement and uncertainty. On the one hand, no entanglement means that Bob's predictions must display some uncertainty. Yet on the other hand, maximal entanglement means that there is no more uncertainty at all. Here we follow an operational approach and give an exact relation - an equality - between the amount of uncertainty as measured by the guessing probability, and the amount of entanglement as measured by the recoverable entanglement fidelity. From this equality we deduce a simple criterion for witnessing bipartite entanglement and a novel entanglement monogamy equality."

Intuitively, by the uncertainty principle and the monogamy of entanglement, the probability that both players simultaneously succeed in guessing the outcome correctly is bounded. We are interested in the question of how the success probability scales when many such games are performed in parallel. We show that any strategy that maximizes the probability to win every game individually is also optimal for the parallel repetition of the game. Our result implies that the optimal guessing probability can be achieved without the use of entanglement. We explore several applications of this result. First, we show that it implies security for standard BB84 quantum key distribution when the receiving party uses fully untrusted measurement devices, i.e. we show that BB84 is one-sided device independent. Second, we show how our result can be used to prove security of a one-round position-verification scheme. Finally, we generalize a well-known uncertainty relation for the guessing probability to quantum side information."
1378,1210.0194,2012,10,17,13,"If no information gain implies no disturbance, then any discrete physical theory is classical",Corsin Pfister;Stephanie Wehner,"It has been suggested that nature could be discrete in the sense that the underlying state space of a physical system has only a finite number of pure states. For example, the Bloch ball of a single qubit could be discretized into small patches and only appear round to us due to experimental limitations. Here, we present a strong physical argument for the quantum theoretical property that every state space (even the smallest possible one, the qubit) has infinitely many pure states. We propose a simple physical postulate which dictates that in fact the only possible discrete theory is classical mechanics. More specifically, we postulate that no information gain implies no disturbance, or read in the contrapositive, that disturbance leads to some form of information gain. In a theory like quantum mechanics where we already know that the converse holds, i.e. information gain does imply disturbance, this can be understood as postulating an equivalence between disturbance and information gain. What is more, we show that non-classical discrete theories are still ruled out even if we relax the postulate to hold only approximately in the sense that no information gain only causes a small amount of disturbance. Finally, our postulate also rules out popular generalizations such as the PR-box that allows non-local correlations beyond the limits of quantum theory."
1379,1209.2162,2012,10,2,13,(Quantumness in the context of) Resource Theories,Michał Horodecki;Jonathan Oppenheim,"We review the basic idea behind resource theories, where we quantify quantum resources by specifying a restricted class of operations. This divides the state space into various sets, including states which are free (because they can be created under the class of operations), and those which are a resource (because they cannot be). One can quantify the worth of the resource by the relative entropy distance to the set of free states, and under certain conditions, this is a unique measure which quantifies the rate of state to state transitions. The framework includes entanglement, asymmetry and purity theory. It also includes thermodynamics, which is a hybrid resource theory combining purity theory and asymmetry. Another hybrid resource theory which merges purity theory and entanglement can be used to study quantumness of correlations and discord, and we present quantumness in this more general framework of resource theories."
1380,1209.0449,2012,9,12,13,Classical command of quantum systems via rigidity of CHSH games,Ben W Reichardt;Falk Unger;Umesh Vazirani,"Can a classical system command a general adversarial quantum system to realize arbitrary quantum dynamics? If so, then we could realize the dream of device-independent quantum cryptography: using untrusted quantum devices to establish a shared random key, with security based on the correctness of quantum mechanics. It would also allow for testing whether a claimed quantum computer is truly quantum. Here we report a technique by which a classical system can certify the joint, entangled state of a bipartite quantum system, as well as command the application of specific operators on each subsystem. This is accomplished by showing a strong converse to Tsirelson's optimality result for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game: the only way to win many games is if the bipartite state is close to the tensor product of EPR states, and the measurements are the optimal CHSH measurements on successive qubits. This leads directly to a scheme for device-independent quantum key distribution. Control over the state and operators can also be leveraged to create more elaborate protocols for reliably realizing general quantum circuits."

The cost functions associated with these two clause-based optimization problems are similar as they are both defined on 3-regular hypergraphs. For 3-regular 3-XORSAT the clauses contain three variables and for 3-regular Max-Cut the clauses contain two variables. The quantum adiabatic algorithms we study for these two problems use interpolating Hamiltonians which are stoquastic and therefore amenable to sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo and quantum cavity methods. Using these techniques we find that the quantum adiabatic algorithm fails to solve either of these problems efficiently, although for different reasons."

We apply welding to construct surface codes and then use the surface codes to construct solid codes, a variant of a 3-d toric code with rough and smooth boundaries. Finally, we weld solid codes together to produce a $(O(L^3),1,O(L^{4/3}))$ stabilizer code with an energy barrier of $O(L^{2/3})$, which solves an open problem of whether a power law energy barrier is possible for local stabilizer code Hamiltonians in three-dimensions. The previous highest energy barrier is $O(\log L)$. Previous no-go results are avoided by breaking translation invariance."

Our proof uses the fact that the acceptance probability of a T-query algorithm can be written as the sum of squares of degree-T polynomials."
1384,1310.0529,2013,8,7,12,Adiabatic quantum optimization with the wrong Hamiltonian,Kevin C Young;Robin Blume-Kohout;Daniel A Lidar,"Analog models of quantum information processing, such as adiabatic quantum computation and analog quantum simulation, require the ability to subject a system to precisely specified Hamiltonians. Unfortunately, the hardware used to implement these Hamiltonians will be imperfect and limited in its precision. Even small perturbations and imprecisions can have profound effects on the nature of the ground state. Here we consider an imperfect implementation of adiabatic quantum optimization and show that, for a widely applicable random control noise model, quantum stabilizer encodings are able to reduce the effective noise magnitude and thus improve the likelihood of a successful computation or simulation. This reduction builds upon two design principles: summation of equivalent logical operators to increase the energy scale of the encoded optimization problem, and the inclusion of a penalty term comprising the sum of the code stabilizer elements. We illustrate our findings with an Ising ladder and show that classical repetition coding drastically increases the probability that the ground state of a perturbed model is decodable to that of the unperturbed model, while using only realistic two-body interaction. Finally, we note that the repetition encoding is a special case of quantum stabilizer encodings, and show that this in principle allows us to generalize our results to many types of analog quantum information processing, albeit at the expense of many-body interactions."

We show that the proposed algorithm is exponentially faster than its classical counterpart and has the same complexity as the corresponding circuit-based algorithm. Together with other related studies, this result supports a conjecture that the complexity of adiabatic quantum computation is equivalent to the circuit-based computational model in a stronger sense than the well-known, proven polynomial equivalence between the two paradigms. We also discuss the importance of the algorithm and its theoretical and experimental implications for the existence of an adiabatic version of Shor's integer factorization algorithm that would have the same complexity as the original algorithm."

However, the signal to noise ratio for a given light intensity is limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL), which is critical for the measurements where the probe light intensity is limited to avoid damaging the sample. The SQL can only be beaten by using \it N quantum correlated particles, with an improvement factor of $\sqrt{N}$. Here we report the first demonstration of an entanglement-enhanced microscope, which is a confocal-type differential interference contrast microscope where an entangled photon pair (\it N=2) source is used for illumination. An image of a Q shape carved in relief on the glass surface is obtained with better visibility than with a classical light source. The signal to noise ratio is 1.35$\pm$0.12 times better than that limited by the SQL."

This motivates a natural comparison between, on the one hand, adiabatic preparation of steady states of Lindbladian generators and, on the other hand, relaxation towards the same steady states subject to the final Lindbladian of the adiabatic process. In this work we thus adopt the perspective that the goal is the most efficient possible preparation of such steady states, rather than ground states. Using known rigorous bounds for the open-system adiabatic theorem and for mixing times, we are then led to a disturbing conclusion that at first appears to doom efforts to build physical quantum annealers: relaxation seems to always converge faster than adiabatic preparation. However, by carefully estimating the adiabatic preparation time for Lindbladians describing thermalization in the low temperature limit, we show that there is, after all, room for an adiabatic speedup over relaxation. To test the analytically derived bounds for the adiabatic preparation time and the relaxation time, we numerically study three models: a dissipative quasi-free fermionic chain, a single qubit coupled to a thermal bath, and the ""spike"" problem of $n$ qubits coupled to a thermal bath. Via these models we find that the answer to the ""which wins"" question depends for each model on the temperature and the system-bath coupling strength. In the case of the ""spike"" problem we find that relaxation during the adiabatic evolution plays an important role in ensuring a speedup over the final-time relaxation procedure. Thus, relaxation-assisted adiabatic preparation can be more efficient than both pure adiabatic evolution and pure relaxation."

Here, we propose an information-theoretic quantifier for steering called intrinsic steerability, which uses conditional mutual information to measure the deviation of a given assemblage from one having a local hidden-state model. We thus relate conditional mutual information to quantum steering and introduce monotones that satisfy certain desirable properties. The idea behind the quantifier is to suppress the correlations that can be explained by an inaccessible quantum system and then quantify the remaining intrinsic correlations. A variant of the intrinsic steerability finds operational meaning as the classical communication cost of sending the measurement choice and outcome to an eavesdropper who possesses a purifying system of the underlying bipartite quantum state that is being measured."

We use the random matrix theory and free probability to show that the distance between two independent random channels tends to a constant value as the dimension of the system grows larger. As a measure of the distance we use the diamond norm. In the case of a flat Hilbert-Schmidt distribution on quantum channels, we obtain that the distance converges to $\frac12 + \frac{2}{\pi}$. Furthermore, we show that for a random state $\rho$ acting on a bipartite Hilbert space $\HH_A \otimes \HH_B$, sampled from the Hilbert-Schmidt distribution, the reduced states $\Tr_A\rho$ and $\Tr_B \rho$ are arbitrarily close to the maximally mixed state. This implies that, for large dimensions, the state $\rho$ may be interpreted as a Jamiołkowski state of a unital map."

By developing a general scheme to extract the useful entanglement from SPT ordered states, we can associate to each of these phases a Lie group of executable gates.

The construction can be extended to obtain a $(3+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theory (TQFT). The invariant of $4$-manifolds generalizes several known invariants in literature such as the Crane-Yetter invariant from a ribbon fusion category and Yetter's invariant from homotopy $2$-types. If the $G$-BSFC is concentrated only at the sector indexed by the trivial group element, a co-homology class in $H^4(G,U(1))$ can be introduced to produce a different invariant, which reduces to the twisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theory in a special case. Although not proven, it is believed that our invariants are strictly different from other known invariants. It remains to see if the invariants are sensitive to smooth structures. It is expected that the most general input to the construction of $(3+1)$-TQFTs is a spherical fusion $2$-category. We show that a $G$-BSFC corresponds to a monoidal $2$-category with certain extra structures, but these structures do not satisfy all the axioms of a spherical fusion $2$-category given by M. Mackaay. Thus the question of what axioms properly define a spherical fusion $2$-category is open."

There are now advanced simulation experiments with nine qubits, and commitments to demonstrate quantum supremacy with fifty qubits within just a few years. The time is therefore ripe for providing an overview of superconducting devices and systems: to discuss the state of the art of applications to quantum information processing (QIP), and to describe recent and upcoming applications of superconducting systems to digital and analogue computing and simulation in Physics and Chemistry. On top of that, the review will try to address general questions like ""What can a quantum computer do that a classical computer can't?""."

In this paper we consider the minimum number of communication rounds needed to perform the locality-constrained task of entanglement transformation and the analogous classical task of secrecy manipulation. Specifically we address whether bipartite mixed entanglement can always be converted into pure entanglement or whether unsecure classical correlations can always be transformed into secret shared randomness using local operations and a bounded number of communication exchanges. Our main contribution in this paper is an explicit construction of quantum and classical state transformations which, for any given $r$, can be achieved using $r$ rounds of classical communication exchanges but no fewer. Our results reveal that highly complex communication protocols are indeed necessary to fully harness the information-theoretic resources contained in general quantum and classical states. The major technical contribution of this manuscript lies in proving lower bounds for the required number of communication exchanges using the notion of common information and various lemmas built upon it. We propose a classical analog to the Schmidt rank of a bipartite quantum state which we call the secrecy rank, and we show that it is a monotone under stochastic local classical operations."

We implement non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by adding antiferromagnetically coupled two-spin driver terms to the traditionally-studied transverse field Ising model and compare their success rate to the performance of similar stoquastic Hamiltonians. We focus on a long-range spin glass problem Hamiltonian and carry out the comparison by numerically calculating the success probabilities and the lowest energy states in systems of up to 17 spins. We find that for a small percentage of harder instances non-stoquastic Hamiltonians can provide large improvement over stoquastic Hamiltonians and these improvements persist as the system size grows.

First, we start with an Euclidean path-integral computation of ground state wave functions with a UV cut off. We consider its efficient optimization by making its UV cut off position dependent and define a quantum state at each length scale. We conjecture that this path-integral corresponds to a time slice of AdS. Next, we derive a flow of quantum states by rewriting the action of Killing vectors of AdS3 in terms of the dual 2d CFT. Both approaches support a correspondence between the hyperbolic time slice H2 in AdS3 and a version of continuous MERA (cMERA). We also give a heuristic argument why we can expect a sub-AdS scale bulk locality for holographic CFTs."

Environmental loss and noise, however, easily destroy nonclassical resources, and thus nullify the performance advantages of most quantum-enhanced sensors. Quantum illumination (QI) is different. It is a robust entanglement-enhanced sensing scheme whose 6 dB performance advantage over a coherent-state sensor of the same average transmitted photon number survives the initial entanglement's eradication by loss and noise. Unfortunately, an implementation of the optimum quantum receiver that would reap QI's full performance advantage has remained elusive, owing to its having to deal with a huge number of very noisy optical modes. We show how sum-frequency generation (SFG) can be fruitfully applied to optimum multi-mode Gaussian-mixed-state discrimination. Applied to QI, our analysis and numerical evaluations demonstrate that our SFG receiver saturates QI's quantum Chernoff bound. Moreover, augmenting our SFG receiver with a feed-forward (FF) mechanism pushes its performance to the Helstrom bound in the limit of low signal brightness. The FF-SFG receiver thus opens the door to optimum quantum-enhanced imaging, radar detection, state and channel tomography, and communication in practical Gaussian-state situations."

It is shown that the Riemannian metric $g^{(D_\alpha)}$ is monotone if and only if $\alpha\in(-\infty, -1]\cup [\frac{1}{2},\infty)$, and that the quantum statistical manifold $({\mathcal{S}}, g^{(D_\alpha)}, \nabla^{(D_\alpha)},\nabla^{(D_\alpha)*})$ is dually flat if and only if $\alpha=1$."
1402,1608.06228,2016,8,30,12,Absolutely maximally entangled states of seven qubits do not exist,Felix Huber;Otfried Gühne;Jens Siewert,"Pure multiparticle quantum states are called absolutely maximally entangled if all reduced states obtained by tracing out at least half of the particles are maximally mixed. We provide a method to characterize these states for a general multiparticle system. With that, we prove that a seven-qubit state whose three-body marginals are all maximally mixed does not exist. Furthermore, we obtain an upper limit on the possible number of maximally mixed three-body marginals and identify the state saturating the bound. This solves the seven-particle problem as the last open case concerning maximally entangled states of qubits."
1403,1608.03820,2016,8,23,12,Recursive cheating strategies for the relativistic $F_Q$ bit commitment protocol,Rémi Bricout;André Chailloux,"In this paper, we study relativistic bit commitment, which uses timing and location constraints to achieve information theoretic security. We consider the $F_Q$ multi-round bit commitment scheme introduced by Lunghi et al. [LKB+15]. This protocol was shown secure against classical adversaries as long as the number of rounds $m$ is small compared to $\sqrt{Q}$ where $Q$ is the size of the used field in the protocol [CCL15,FF16]. In this work, we study classical attacks on this scheme. We use classical strategies for the $CHSH_Q$ game described in [BS15] to derive cheating strategies for this protocol. In particular, our cheating strategy shows that if $Q$ is an even power of any prime, then the protocol is not secure when the number of rounds $m$ is of the order of $\sqrt{Q}$. For those values of $Q$, this means that the upper bound of [CCL15,FF16] is essentially optimal."
1404,1608.02650,2016,8,15,12,Local Broadcasting of Quantum Correlations,Marco Piani,"Operations that are trivial in the classical world, like accessing information without introducing any change or disturbance, or like copying information, become non-trivial in the quantum world. In this note we discuss several limitations in the local redistributing correlations, when it comes to dealing with bipartite quantum states. In particular, we focus on the task of local broadcasting, by discussing relevant no-go theorems, and by quantifying the non-classicality of correlations in terms of the degree to which local broadcasting is possible in an approximate fashion."
1405,1607.08168,2016,7,28,12,Adaptive Versus Non-Adaptive Strategies in the Quantum Setting with Applications,Frédéric Dupuis;Serge Fehr;Philippe Lamontagne;Louis Salvail,"We prove a general relation between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies in the quantum setting, i.e., between strategies where the adversary can or cannot adaptively base its action on some auxiliary quantum side information. Our relation holds in a very general setting, and is applicable as long as we can control the bit-size of the side information, or, more generally, its ""information content"". Since adaptivity is notoriously difficult to handle in the analysis of (quantum) cryptographic protocols, this gives us a very powerful tool: as long as we have enough control over the side information, it is sufficient to restrict ourselves to non-adaptive attacks. We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology with two examples. The first is a quantum bit commitment scheme based on 1-bit cut-and-choose. Since bit commitment implies oblivious transfer (in the quantum setting), and oblivious transfer is universal for two-party computation, this implies the universality of 1-bit cut-and-choose, and thus solves the main open problem of [FKSZZ13]. The second example is a quantum bit commitment scheme proposed in 1993 by Brassard et al. It was originally suggested as an unconditionally secure scheme, back when this was thought to be possible. We partly restore the scheme by proving it secure in (a variant of) the bounded quantum storage model. In both examples, the fact that the adversary holds quantum side information obstructs a direct analysis of the scheme, and we circumvent it by analyzing a non-adaptive version, which can be done by means of known techniques, and applying our main result."
1406,1607.04203,2016,7,15,12,Random quantum correlations are generically non-classical,Carlos E González-Guillén;Cécilia Lancien;Carlos Palazuelos;Ignacio Villanueva,"It is now a well-known fact that the correlations arising from local dichotomic measurements on an entangled quantum state may exhibit intrinsically non-classical features. In this paper we delve into a comprehensive study of random instances of such bipartite correlations. The main question we are interested in is: given a quantum correlation, taken at random, how likely is it that it is truly non-explainable by a classical model? We show that, under very general assumptions on the considered distribution, a random correlation which lies on the border of the quantum set is with high probability outside the classical set. What is more, we are able to provide the Bell inequality certifying this fact. On the technical side, our results follow from (i) estimating precisely the ""quantum norm"" of a random matrix, and (ii) lower bounding sharply enough its ""classical norm"", hence proving a gap between the two. Along the way, we need a non-trivial upper bound on the $\infty{\rightarrow}1$ norm of a random orthogonal matrix, which might be of independent interest."

Actual implementations of quantum computers will be susceptible to loss in the form of physically faulty qubits. Though these physical faults must negatively affect the computation, we can deal with them by adapting error correction schemes. In this paper We have simulated statically placed single-fault lattices and lattices with randomly placed faults at functional qubit yields of 80%, 90% and 95%, showing practical performance of a defective surface code by employing actual circuit constructions and realistic errors on every gate, including identity gates. We extend Stace et al.'s superplaquettes solution against dynamic losses for the surface code to handle static losses such as physically faulty qubits. The single-fault analysis shows that a static loss at the periphery of the lattice has less negative effect than a static loss at the center. The randomly-faulty analysis shows that 95% yield is good enough to build a large scale quantum computer. The local gate error rate threshold is $\sim 0.3\%$, and a code distance of seven suppresses the residual error rate below the original error rate at $p=0.1\%$. 90% yield is also good enough when we discard badly fabricated quantum computation chips, while 80% yield does not show enough error suppression even when discarding 90% of the chips. We evaluated several metrics for predicting chip performance, and found that the depth of the deepest stabilizer circuit in the lattice gave the strongest correlation with post-correction residual error rates. Our analysis will help with selecting usable quantum computation chips from among the pool of all fabricated chips."

However, a model making the same output predictions but in a deterministic manner would be, in principle, experimentally indistinguishable from quantum theory. In this work we consider such models in the context of non-locality on a device independent scenario. That is, we study pairs of non-local boxes that produce their outputs deterministically. It is known that, for these boxes to be non-local, at least one of the boxes' output has to depend on the other party's input via some kind of hidden signaling. We prove that, if the deterministic mechanism is also algorithmic, there is a protocol which, with the sole knowledge of any upper bound on the time complexity of such algorithm, extracts that hidden signaling and uses it for the communication of information."
1409,1606.01848,2016,6,14,12,Quantum state-independent contextuality requires 13 rays,Adán Cabello;Matthias Kleinmann;José R Portillo,"We show that, regardless of the dimension of the Hilbert space, there exists no set of rays revealing state-independent contextuality with less than 13 rays. This implies that the set proposed by Yu and Oh in dimension three [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 030402 (2012)] is actually the minimal set in quantum theory. This contrasts with the case of Kochen-Specker sets, where the smallest set occurs in dimension four."
1410,1606.00056,2016,6,7,12,Large-scale error-correction protocols using global operations in ion traps,Yannick Seis;Joseph F Goodwin;Benjamin J Brown;Terry G Rudolph,"The technical demands to perform quantum error correction are considerable. The task requires the preparation of a many-body entangled state, together with the ability to make parity measurements over subsets of the physical qubits of the system to detect errors. Here we propose two trapped-ion experiments to realise error-correcting codes of arbitrary size to defend a single encoded qubit from dephasing errors. Novel to both of our schemes, which are achievable using both Penning traps and Paul traps, is the use of a global entangling phase gate. We make use of this entangling operation to significantly reduce the experimental complexity of state preparation and syndrome measurements. We also show, in our second scheme, that storage times can be increased further by repeatedly teleporting the logical information between two codes supported by the same ionic crystal to learn information about the locations of errors. We estimate that a qubit encoded in such a crystal will remain a high fidelity state for a time that is an order of magnitude longer than a qubit written to a single confined ion."

Notwithstanding, when information is encoded in a quantum system, the phenomenon of quantum data locking allows one to encrypt a message with a shorter key and still provide information-theoretic security. We present one of the first feasible experimental demonstrations of quantum data locking for direct communication and propose a scheme for a quantum enigma machine that encrypts 6 bits per photon (containing messages, new encryption keys, and forward error correction bits) with less than 6 bits per photon of encryption key while remaining information-theoretically secure."
1412,1605.05119,2016,5,24,12,The Quantum Black Hole as a Hydrogen Atom: Microstates Without Strings Attached,Gerard t Hooft,"Applying an expansion in spherical harmonics, turns the black hole with its microstates into something about as transparent as the hydrogen atom was in the early days of quantum mechanics. It enables us to present a concise description of the evolution laws of these microstates, linking them to perturbative quantum field theory, in the background of the Schwarzschild metric. Three pieces of insight are obtained: One, we learn how the gravitational back reaction, whose dominant component can be calculated exactly, turns particles entering the hole, into particles leaving it, by exchanging the momentum- and position operators; two, we find out how this effect removes firewalls, both on the future and the past event horizon, and three, we discover that the presence of region II in the Penrose diagram forces a topological twist in the background metric, culminating in antipodal identification. Although a cut-off is required that effectively replaces the transverse coordinates by a lattice, the effect of such a cut-off minimizes when the spherical wave expansion is applied. This expansion then reveals exactly how antipodal identification restores unitarity - for each partial wave separately. We expect that these ideas will provide new insights in some highly non-trivial topological space-time features at the Planck scale."
1413,1605.02756,2016,5,18,12,Factoring with Qutrits: Shor's Algorithm on Ternary and Metaplectic Quantum Architectures,Alex Bocharov;Martin Roetteler;Krysta M Svore,"We determine the cost of performing Shor's algorithm for integer factorization on a ternary quantum computer, using two natural models of universal fault tolerant computing on ternary quantum systems: (i) a model based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability of the ternary Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control and (ii) a model based on a metaplectic topological quantum computer (MTQC). Arguably, a natural choice to implement Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic into a ternary form. However, it is also possible to simply emulate the standard binary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three level system. In this paper we address this emulation approach and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's period finding function in both models, (i) and (ii).We compare the costs in terms of magic state counts required in each mode and find that a binary emulation implementation of Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer requires slightly smaller circuit depth than the corresponding implementation in the binary Clifford$+T$ framework. The reason for this are simplifications for binary arithmetic that can be leveraged over ternary gate sets. We also highlight that magic state preparation on MTQC requires magic state preprocessor of asymptotically smaller size which gives the MTQC solution a significant advantage over the binary framework."
1414,1604.03208,2016,5,11,12,The ultimate physical limits to reversibility,Andrew J P Garner;Vlatko Vedral,"We argue that if, in order to reverse an object's dynamics, we need to be able to keep track of it with enough precision, then there is an upper bound on the size of the object whose dynamics we can reverse - even using all the available resources of the universe. Using a bound from the holographic principle and treating the universe as the ultimate quantum computer, we show that if we want to reverse the dynamics of an object which has evolved since the beginning of time, its radius cannot exceed ten microns. If this computation is performed irreversibly, the object must be much smaller. This places a lower bound on the size of the smallest possible quantum measurement device."
1415,1604.00501,2016,4,13,12,Quantum steering: a short review with focus on semidefinite programming,Daniel Cavalcanti;Paul Skrzypczyk,"Quantum steering refers to a situation where two parties share a bipartite system onto which one of the parties applies measurements that changes the state of the other party in a way that can not be explained by classical means. Quantum steering has been interpreted as the task of entanglement detection in a one-sided device independent way and has received a lot of attention since then. Here we address the characterisation of quantum steering through semidefinite programming, including steering detection, quantification and applications. We also give a brief overview of some results on quantum steering not directly related to semidefinite programming. Finally, we make available a list of semidefinite programming codes that can be used to study the topics discussed in this article."

In the first case it brings noticeable benefits at the measurement stage (output super-additvity), whereas in the latter it is the entanglement of the input probes that enables significant performance enhancement (input super-additvity). We identify a weak estimation regime where a strong connection between concepts crucial to the two fields is demonstrated; the accessible information and the Holevo quantity on one side and the quantum Fisher information related quantities on the other. This allows us to shed new light on the problem of super-additivity in communication using the concepts of quantum estimation theory."
1417,1602.07761,2016,3,3,12,Entanglement and correlation functions of a recent exactly solvable spin chain,Ramis Movassagh,"We present exact results on the exactly solvable spin chain of Bravyi et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 207202 (2012)]. This model is a spin one chain and has a Hamiltonian that is local and translationally invariant in the bulk. It has a unique (frustration free) ground state with an energy gap that is polynomially small in the system's size ($2n$). The half-chain entanglement entropy of the ground state is $\frac{1}{2}\log n+const.$. Here we first write the Hamiltonian in the standard spin-basis representation. We prove that at zero temperature, the magnetization is along the $z-$direction i.e., $\langle s^{x}\rangle=\langle s^{y}\rangle=0$ (everywhere on the chain). We then analytically calculate $\langle s^{z}\rangle$ and the two-point correlation functions of $s^{z}$. By analytically diagonalizing the reduced density matrices, we calculate the Schmidt rank, von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies for: 1. Any partition of the chain into two pieces (not necessarily in the middle) and 2. $L$ consecutive spins centered in the middle. Further, we identify entanglement Hamiltonians (Eqs. 40 and 50). We prove a small lemma (Lemma1) on the combinatorics of lattice paths using the reflection principle to relate and calculate the Motzkin walk 'height' to spin expected values. We also calculate the, closely related, (scaled) correlation functions of Brownian excursions. The known features of this model are summarized in a table in Sec.I."
1418,1602.00413,2016,2,26,12,Linear Programming Bounds for Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Error-Correcting Codes by Split Weight Enumerators,Ching-Yi Lai;Alexei Ashikhmin,"Linear programming approaches have been applied to derive upper bounds on the size of classical codes and quantum codes. In this paper, we derive similar results for general quantum codes with entanglement assistance, including nonadditive codes, by considering a type of split weight enumerators. After deriving the MacWilliams identities for these split weight enumerators, we are able to prove algebraic linear programming bounds, such as the Singleton bound, the Hamming bound, and the first linear programming bound. In particular, we show that the first linear programming bound improves the Hamming bound when the relative distance is sufficiently large. On the other hand, we obtain additional constraints on the size of Pauli subgroups for quantum codes, which allow us to improve the linear programming bounds on the minimum distance of small quantum codes. In particular, we show that there is no [[27,15,5]] quantum stabilizer code. We also discuss the existence of some entanglement-assisted quantum stabilizer codes with maximal entanglement. As a result, the upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of maximal-entanglement quantum stabilizer codes with length up to 15 are significantly improved."

Such an asymmetry of states can be considered as a resource in applications such as quantum metrology, and it is a concept that encompasses quantum coherence as a special case. We introduce explicitly and study the robustness of asymmetry, a quantifier of asymmetry of states that we prove to have many attractive properties, including efficient numerical computability via semidefinite programming, and an operational interpretation in a channel discrimination context. We also introduce the notion of asymmetry witnesses, whose measurement in a laboratory detects the presence of asymmetry. We prove that properly constrained asymmetry witnesses provide lower bounds to the robustness of asymmetry, which is shown to be a directly measurable quantity itself. We then focus our attention on coherence witnesses and the robustness of coherence, for which we prove a number of additional results; these include an analysis of its specific relevance in phase discrimination and quantum metrology, an analytical calculation of its value for a relevant class of quantum states, and tight bounds that relate it to another previously defined coherence monotone."
1420,1601.01720,2016,1,18,12,Spectral Gap Analysis for Efficient Tunneling in Quantum Adiabatic Optimization,Lucas T Brady;Wim van Dam,"We investigate the efficiency of Quantum Adiabatic Optimization when overcoming potential barriers to get from a local to a global minimum. Specifically we look at n qubit systems with symmetric cost functions f:0, 1^n->R where the ground state must tunnel through a potential barrier of width n^a and height n^b. By the quantum adiabatic theorem the time delay sufficient to ensure tunneling grows quadratically with the inverse spectral gap during this tunneling process. We analyze barrier sizes with 1/2 < a + b and a < 1/2 and show that the minimum gap scales polynomially as n^1/2-a-b when 2a+b < 1 and exponentially as n^-b/2 exp(-C n^(2a+b-1)/2 ) when 1 < 2a+b. Our proof uses elementary techniques and confirms and extends an unpublished folklore result by Goldstone, which used large spin and instanton methods. Parts of our result also refine recent results by Kong and Crosson and Jiang et al. about the exponential gap scaling."
1421,1512.08225,2015,1,11,12,Majorization preservation of Gaussian bosonic channels,Michael G Jabbour;Raúl García-Patrón;Nicolas J Cerf,"It is shown that phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channels are majorization-preserving over the set of passive states of the harmonic oscillator. This means that comparable passive states under majorization are transformed into equally comparable passive states. The proof relies on a new preorder relation called Fock-majorization, which coincides with regular majorization for passive states but also induces a mean photon number order, thereby connecting the concepts of energy and disorder of a quantum state. As an application, the consequences of majorization preservation are investigated in the context of the broadcast communication capacity of bosonic Gaussian channels. Most of our results being independent of the bosonic nature of the system under investigation, they could be generalized to other quantum systems and Hamiltonians, providing a general tool that could prove useful in quantum information theory and quantum thermodynamics."

Our method is derived from the fault-point formalism previously used to determine the success rate of low-distance error correction codes. Here we apply it to a wider range of quantum protocols and identify circuit structures that allow for efficient calculation of the exact success probability and even the final distribution of output states. As examples, we apply our method to the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and the Steane [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code and compare the results to Monte Carlo simulations."

The following document offers a hybrid discussion; both reviewing the field as it is currently, and suggesting directions for further research.

In this paper, we study parallel self-testing of two maximally entangled pairs of qubits: in particular, the local tensor product structure is not assumed but derived. We prove two criteria that achieve the desired result: a double use of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and the $3\times 3$ Magic Square game. This demonstrate that the magic square game can only be perfectly won by measureing a two-singlets state. The tolerance to noise is well within reach of state-of-the-art experiments."
1425,1512.00859,2015,12,8,12,Faster than Classical Quantum Algorithm for dense Formulas of Exact Satisfiability and Occupation Problems,Salvatore Mandrà;Gian Giacomo Guerreschi;Alán Aspuru-Guzik,"We present an exact quantum algorithm for solving the Exact Satisfiability (XSAT) problem, which belongs to the important NP-complete complexity class. The algorithm is based on an intuitive approach that can be divided into two parts: First, the identification and efficient characterization of a restricted subspace that contains all the valid assignments of the XSAT; Second, a quantum search in such restricted subspace. The quantum algorithm can be used either to find a valid assignment (or to certify that no solution exists) or to count the total number of valid assignments. The query complexities for the worst-case are respectively bounded by $O(\sqrt{2^{n-M^{\prime}}})$ and $O(2^{n-M^{\prime}})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $M^{\prime}$ the number of linearly independent clauses. Remarkably, the proposed quantum algorithm results to be faster than any known exact classical algorithm to solve dense formulas of XSAT. As a concrete application, we provide the worst-case complexity for the Hamiltonian cycle problem obtained after mapping it to a suitable XSAT. Specifically, we show that the time complexity for the proposed quantum algorithm is bounded by $O(2^{n/4})$ for 3-regular undirected graphs, where $n$ is the number of nodes. The same worst-case complexity holds for $(3,3)$-regular bipartite graphs (the current best classical algorithm has a (worst-case) running time bounded by $O(2^{31n/96})$). Finally, when compared to heuristic techniques for XSAT, the proposed quantum algorithm is faster than the classical WalkSAT and Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for random instances with a density of constraints close to the satisfiability threshold, the regime in which instances are typically the hardest to solve. The proposed quantum algorithm can be also extended to the generalized version of the XSAT known as Occupation problem."

It is known that the maximal violation of some Bell inequalities suffices for this purpose. However, most of the existing self-testing protocols for two devices exploit the well-known Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality or modifications of it, and always with two measurements per party. Here, we generalize the previous results by demonstrating that one can construct self-testing protocols based on the chained Bell inequalities, defined for two devices implementing an arbitrary number of two-output measurements. On the one hand, this proves that the quantum state and measurements leading to the maximal violation of the chained Bell inequality are unique. On the other hand, in the limit of a large number of measurements, our approach allows one to self-test the entire plane of measurements spanned by the Pauli matrices X and Z. Our results also imply that the chained Bell inequalities can be used to certify two bits of perfect randomness."

Incompatibility is a fascinating aspect of physical theories, especially in the case of quantum theory. The concept of incompatibility gives a common ground for several famous impossibility statements within quantum theory, such as ``no-cloning'' and ``no information without disturbance''; these can be all seen as statements about incompatibility of certain devices. The purpose of this paper is to give a concise overview of some of the central aspects of incompatibility."

One recent approach has been via resource-theoretic formulations, and in particular formulations that try to capture genuinely quantum mechanical properties within a thermodynamic context. Here we discuss how the set of free states of thermodynamic theories is strongly constrained in the presence of a microscopic conservation law; we show that for the simplest case of a Hamiltonian with no other conserved quantities the only non-trivial resource theories are either thermal operations or one of a range of coherence theories. We next discuss certain issues that arise when one introduces conserved charges into thermodynamic resource theories. Specifically we consider both commuting and non-commuting conserved charges, and highlight subtleties that exist between dynamical equilibration accounts, maximum entropy approaches and resource formulations. We conclude by constructing Landauer erasure bounds for these conserved charges. For this, we find trade-offs can exist between the energetic and other conserved charges erasure costs. It is found that the particular Landauer erasure bound we obtain is not sensitive to whether the charges commute or not."
1429,1511.02627,2015,11,16,12,Exponential Decay of Matrix $\Phi$-Entropies on Markov Semigroups with Applications to Dynamical Evolutions of Quantum Ensembles,Hao-Chung Cheng;Min-Hsiu Hsieh;Marco Tomamichel,"In the study of Markovian processes, one of the principal achievements is the equivalence between the $\Phi$-Sobolev inequalities and an exponential decrease of the $\Phi$-entropies. In this work, we develop a framework of Markov semigroups on matrix-valued functions and generalize the above equivalence to the exponential decay of matrix $\Phi$-entropies. This result also specializes to spectral gap inequalities and modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in the random matrix setting. To establish the main result, we define a non-commutative generalization of the carré du champ operator, and prove a de Bruijn's identity for matrix-valued functions. The proposed Markov semigroups acting on matrix-valued functions have immediate applications in the characterization of the dynamical evolution of quantum ensembles. We consider two special cases of quantum unital channels, namely, the depolarizing channel and the phase-damping channel. In the former, since there exists a unique equilibrium state, we show that the matrix $\Phi$-entropy of the resulting quantum ensemble decays exponentially as time goes on. Consequently, we obtain a stronger notion of monotonicity of the Holevo quantity - the Holevo quantity of the quantum ensemble decays exponentially in time and the convergence rate is determined by the modified log-Sobolev inequalities. However, in the latter, the matrix $\Phi$-entropy of the quantum ensemble that undergoes the phase-damping Markovian evolution generally will not decay exponentially. This is because there are multiple equilibrium states for such a channel. Finally, we also consider examples of statistical mixing of Markov semigroups on matrix-valued functions. We can explicitly calculate the convergence rate of a Markovian jump process defined on Boolean hypercubes, and provide upper bounds of the mixing time on these types of examples."

Performing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations we find that the QMC tunneling rate displays the same scaling with system size, as the rate of incoherent tunneling. The scaling in both cases is $O(\Delta^2)$, where $\Delta$ is the tunneling splitting. An important consequence is that QMC simulations can be used to predict the performance of a quantum annealer for tunneling through a barrier. Furthermore, by using open instead of periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time, equivalent to a projector QMC algorithm, we obtain a quadratic speedup for QMC, and achieve linear scaling in $\Delta$. We provide a physical understanding of these results and their range of applicability based on an instanton picture."
1431,1510.05437,2015,10,29,12,Activated zero-error classical capacity of quantum channels in the presence of quantum no-signalling correlations,Runyao Duan;Xin Wang,"Recently the one-shot quantum no-signalling assisted zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel has been formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) depending only on the Choi-Kraus operator space of the channel. In this paper, we study the \textitactivated quantum no-signalling assisted zero-error classical capacity by first allowing the assistance from some noiseless forward communication channel and later paying back the cost of the helper. We show that the one-shot activated capacity can also be formulated as a SDP and derive a number of striking properties of this number. In particular, this number is additive under direct sum, and is always greater than or equal to the super-dense coding bound. An a remarkable consequence, we find that one bit noiseless classical communication is able to fully activate any classical-quantum channel to achieve its asymptotic capacity, or the semidefinite fractional packing number. We also discuss the condition under which a noisy channel can activate an activatable channel. Interestingly, a channel is able to activate itself if its one-shot capacity is greater than or equal to the Golden Ratio - $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. We also show that the asymptotic activated capacity is still equal to the usual no-signalling assisted capacity. Finally, we show that general the asymptotic no-signalling assisted zero-error capacity does not equal to the semidefinite (fractional) packing number by an explicit construction."

This motivates the general study of how physical principles bound computational power. In this paper we show that some of the essential machinery of quantum computation -- namely reversible controlled transformations and the phase kick-back mechanism -- exist in any operational-defined theory with a consistent notion of information. These results provide the tools for an exploration of the physics underpinning the structure of computational algorithms. We use these results to investigate the relationship between interference behaviour and computational power, demonstrating that non-trivial interference behaviour is a general resource for post-classical computation. In proving the above, we connect post-quantum interference -- the higher-order interference of Sorkin -- to the existence of post-quantum particle types, potentially providing a novel experimental test for higher-order interference. Finally, we conjecture that theories with post-quantum interference can solve problems intractable even on a quantum computer."

It was originally derived in the asymptotic i.i.d. setting, in which arbitrarily many (say, $n$) identical copies of the state ($\rho^{\otimes n}$ or $\sigma^{\otimes n}$) are considered to be available. In this setting, the lemma states that, for any given upper bound on the probability $\alpha_n$ of erroneously inferring the state to be $\sigma$, the probability $\beta_n$ of erroneously inferring the state to be $\rho$ decays exponentially in $n$, with the rate of decay converging to the relative entropy of the two states. The second order asymptotics for quantum hypothesis testing, which establishes the speed of convergence of this rate of decay to its limiting value, was derived in the i.i.d. setting independently by Tomamichel and Hayashi, and Li. We extend this result to settings beyond i.i.d.. Examples of these include Gibbs states of quantum spin systems (with finite-range, translation-invariant interactions) at high temperatures."

However, Shannon's approach was rooted is his own information theory, itself inspired by the classical physics of Newton and Einstein. But our world is ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics. When quantum-mechanical phenomena are taken into account, new vistas open up both for codemakers and codebreakers. Is quantum mechanics a blessing or a curse for the protection of privacy? As we shall see, the jury is still out!"

In this work, we reformulate approximations of the quantum capacity by operator space norms and give both upper and lower bounds on quantum capacity, and potential quantum capacity using interpolation techniques. We identify a situation in which nice classes of channels satisfy a ""comparison property"" on entropy, coherent information and capacities. The paradigms for our estimates are so-called conditional expectations. These generally non-degradable channels admit a strongly additive expression for $Q^{(1)}$. We also identify conditions on channels showing that the ""hashing bound"" is optimal for the cb-entropy. These two estimates combined give upper and lower bounds on quantum capacity on our ""nice"" classes of channels, which differ only up to a factor 2, independent of the dimension. The estimates are discussed for certain classes of channels, including group channels, Pauli channels and other high-dimensional channels."

Amplitude damping channels model, in general, the decay process of a multilevel atom or energy dissipation of a bosonic system at zero temperature. We discuss quantum error-correcting codes adapted to amplitude damping channels for higher dimensional systems (qudits). For multi-level atoms, we consider a natural kind of decay process, and for bosonic systems,we consider the qudit amplitude damping channel obtained by truncating the Fock basis of the bosonic modes to a certain maximum occupation number. We construct families of single-error-correcting quantum codes that can be used for both cases. Our codes have larger code dimensions than the previously known single-error-correcting codes of the same lengths. Additionally, we present families of multi-error correcting codes for these two channels, as well as generalizations of our construction technique to error-correcting codes for the qutrit $V$ and $\Lambda$ channels."

On the one side the revelations of Snowden, though he said nothing really new, made the world more aware of the importance to protect sensitive data from all kinds of adversaries, including sometimes ""friends."" On the other side, breakthroughs in quantum computation, in particular in superconducting qubits and surface-codes, made it possible that in 15 to 25 years there might be a quantum machine able to break today's codes. This implies that in order to protect today's data over a few decades, one has to act now and use some quantum-safe cryptography."

[SIAM Journal on Computing, 2005]. Our algorithm is based on the recent $\tilde O(n^{5/4})$-query algorithm given by Le Gall [FOCS 2014] for triangle finding over dense graphs (here $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph). We show in particular that triangle finding can be solved with $O(n^{5/4-\epsilon})$ queries for some constant $\epsilon>0$ whenever the graph has at most $O(n^{2-c})$ edges for some constant $c>0$."

We present a quantum signature scheme that does not require trusted quantum channels. We prove that it is unconditionally secure against the most general coherent attacks, and show that it requires the transmission of significantly fewer quantum states than previous schemes. We also show that the quantum channel noise threshold for our scheme is less strict than for distilling a secure key using quantum key distribution. This shows that direct quantum signature schemes can be preferable to signature schemes relying on secret shared keys generated using quantum key distribution."

We also show how such a formula can be written in terms of symplectic invariants and used to derive closed forms for a variety of basic quantities and tools, such as the Bures metric, the quantum Fisher information and various fidelity-based bounds. Our result can be used to extend the study of continuous-variable protocols, such as quantum teleportation and cloning, beyond the current one-mode or two-mode analyses, and paves the way to solve general problems in quantum metrology and quantum hypothesis testing with arbitrary multimode Gaussian resources."
1441,1506.07502,2015,7,9,12,Sifting attacks in finite-size quantum key distribution,Corsin Pfister;Norbert Lütkenhaus;Stephanie Wehner;Patrick J Coles,"A central assumption in quantum key distribution (QKD) is that Eve has no knowledge about which rounds will be used for parameter estimation or key distillation. Here we show that this assumption is violated for iterative sifting, a sifting procedure that has been employed in some (but not all) of the recently suggested QKD protocols in order to increase their efficiency. We show that iterative sifting leads to two security issues: (1) some rounds are more likely to be key rounds than others, (2) the public communication of past measurement choices changes this bias round by round. We analyze these two previously unnoticed problems, present eavesdropping strategies that exploit them, and find that the two problems are independent. We discuss some sifting protocols in the literature that are immune to these problems. While some of these would be inefficient replacements for iterative sifting, we find that the sifting subroutine of an asymptotically secure protocol suggested by Lo et al (2005 J. Cryptol. 18 133-65), which we call LCA sifting, has an efficiency on par with that of iterative sifting. One of our main results is to show that LCA sifting can be adapted to achieve secure sifting in the finite-key regime. More precisely, we combine LCA sifting with a certain parameter estimation protocol, and we prove the finite-key security of this combination. Hence we propose that LCA sifting should replace iterative sifting in future QKD implementations. More generally, we present two formal criteria for a sifting protocol that guarantee its finite-key security. Our criteria may guide the design of future protocols and inspire a more rigorous QKD analysis, which has neglected sifting-related attacks so far."

But in such applications, it is important to consider the effect of a (sometimes adversarially controlled) memory that can be correlated with the system being measured: The information retained by such a memory can in fact diminish the uncertainty of measurements. Uncertainty conditioned on a memory was considered in the past by Berta et al. (Ref. 1), who found a specific uncertainty relation in terms of the von Neumann conditional entropy. But this entropy is not the only measure that can be used to quantify conditional uncertainty. In the spirit of recent work by several groups (Refs. 2--6), here we develop a general operational framework that formalizes the concept of conditional uncertainty in a measure-independent form. Our formalism is built around a mathematical relation that we call conditional majorization. We define and characterize conditional majorization, and use it to develop tools for the construction of measures of the conditional uncertainty of individual measurements, and also of the joint conditional uncertainty of sets of measurements. We demonstrate the use of this framework by deriving measure-independent conditional uncertainty relations of two types: (1) A lower bound on the minimal joint uncertainty that two remote parties (Bob and Eve) have about the outcome of a given pair of measurements performed by a third remote party (Alice), conditioned on arbitrary measurements that Bob and Eve make on their own systems. This lower bound is independent of the initial state shared by the three parties; (2) An initial state--dependent lower bound on the minimal joint uncertainty that Bob has about Alice's pair of measurements in a bipartite setting, conditioned on Bob's quantum system."

These characterizations help to better understand the properties of matrix $\Phi$-entropies, and are a powerful tool for establishing matrix concentration inequalities for matrix-valued functions of independent random variables. In particular, we use the subadditivity property to prove a Poincaré inequality for the matrix $\Phi$-entropies. We also provide a new proof for the matrix Efron-Stein inequality. Furthermore, we derive logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for matrix-valued functions defined on Boolean hypercubes and with Gaussian distributions. Our proof relies on the powerful matrix Bonami-Beckner inequality. Finally, the Holevo quantity in quantum information theory is closely related to the matrix $\Phi$-entropies. This allows us to upper bound the Holevo quantity of a classical-quantum ensemble that undergoes a special Markov evolution."

The idea is to use the fact that the preparation of certain single-qubit states, so called magic states, plus any Clifford gate operations are universal for quantum computing. If Merlin is honest, he sends the witness plus magic states to Arthur. If Merlin is malicious, he might send other states to Arthur, but Arthur can verify the correctness of magic states by himself. We also generalize the result to QIP[3]: we show that the class QIP[3] does not change even if the computational power of the verifier is restricted to only Clifford gate operations (plus classical XOR gate)."

Specifically, rigorous mathematical constraints on the determinants involving matrices that lie in the split orthogonal group provide a guideline for sign-free simulations of fermionic models on bipartite lattices. This guiding principle not only unifies the recent solutions of the sign problem based on the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo methods and the Majorana representation, but also suggests new efficient algorithms to simulate physical systems that were previously prohibitive because of the sign problem."

We present the first application of a recently developed technique for simulating Hamiltonian evolution using a truncated Taylor series to obtain logarithmic scaling with the inverse of the desired precision, an exponential improvement over all prior methods. The two algorithms developed in this work rely on a second quantized encoding of the wavefunction in which the state of an $N$ spin-orbital system is encoded in ${\cal O}(N)$ qubits. Our first algorithm requires at most $\widetilde{\cal O}(N^8 t)$ gates. Our second algorithm involves on-the-fly computation of molecular integrals, in a way that is exponentially more precise than classical sampling methods, by using the truncated Taylor series simulation technique. Our second algorithm has the lowest gate count of any approach to second quantized quantum chemistry simulation in the literature, scaling as $\widetilde{\cal O}(N^{5} t)$. The approaches presented here are readily applicable to a wide class of fermionic models, many of which are defined by simplified versions of the chemistry Hamiltonian."

This class includes multiple algorithms that have recently attracted attention, including the Bravyi-Haah RG decoder. They are applied to both the problem of single shot error correction (with perfect syndrome measurements) and that of active error correction (with noisy syndrome measurements). For Abelian models we provide a threshold proof in both cases, showing that there is a finite noise threshold under which errors can be arbitrarily suppressed when any decoder in this class is used. For non-Abelian models such a proof is found for the single shot case. The means by which decoding may be performed for active error correction of non-Abelian anyons is studied in detail. Differences with the Abelian case are discussed."

The bound depends only on thermodynamic data, actually a single exponent, the hyper-scaling violation exponent $\theta$. All systems in $d$ spatial dimensions obeying our scaling assumptions and with $\theta < d-1$ obey the area law, while systems with $\theta = d-1$ can violate the area law at most logarithmically. We also discuss the case of frustration-free Hamiltonians and show that to violate the area law more than logarithmically these systems must have an unusually large number of low energy states. Finally, we make contact with the recently proposed $s$-source framework and argue that $\theta$ and $s$ are related by $s=2^\theta$."
1449,1505.06346,2015,5,28,12,Bell inequalities from group actions: Three parties and non-Abelian groups,V Ugur Guney;Mark Hillery,"In a previous publication, we showed how group actions can be used to generate Bell inequalities. The group action yields a set of measurement probabilities whose sum is the basic element in the inequality. The sum has an upper bound if the probabilities are a result of a local, realistic theory, but this bound can be violated if the probabilities come from quantum mechanics. In our first paper, we considered the case of only two parties making the measurements and single-generator groups. Here we show that the method can be extended to three parties, and it can also be extended to non-Abelian groups. We discuss the resulting inequalities in terms of nonlocal games."

In contrast, we here study a quantum repeater architecture that uses simple parametric down-conversion sources, as well as frequency-multiplexed multimode quantum memories and photon-number resolving detectors. We show that this approach can significantly extend quantum communication distances compared to direct transmission. This shows that important trade-offs are possible between the different components of quantum repeater architectures."

For protocols with $r$ rounds, we prove a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(n/r + r)$ on the communication required for computing disjointness of input size $n$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The previous best lower bound was $\Omega(n/r^2 + r)$ due to Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [JRS03]. Along the way, we develop several tools for quantum information complexity, one of which is a lower bound for quantum information complexity in terms of the generalized discrepancy method. As a corollary, we get that the quantum communication complexity of any boolean function $f$ is at most $2^{O(QIC(f))}$, where $QIC(f)$ is the prior-free quantum information complexity of $f$ (with error $1/3$)."

In this work, we investigate whether the phenomenon of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, a different form of quantum nonlocality, can also be generalized beyond quantum theory. While postquantum steering does not exist in the bipartite case, we prove its existence in the case of three observers. Importantly, we show that postquantum steering is a genuinely new phenomenon, fundamentally different from postquantum nonlocality. Our results provide new insight into the nonlocal correlations of multipartite quantum systems."
1453,1505.01123,2015,5,7,12,Mutually unbiased bases as minimal Clifford covariant 2-designs,Huangjun Zhu,"Mutually unbiased bases (MUB) are interesting for various reasons. The most attractive example of (a complete set of) MUB is the one constructed by Ivanović as well as Wootters and Fields, which is referred to as the canonical MUB. Nevertheless, little is known about anything that is unique to this MUB. We show that the canonical MUB in any prime power dimension is uniquely determined by an extremal orbit of the (restricted) Clifford group except in dimension 3, in which case the orbit defines a special symmetric informationally complete measurement (SIC), known as the Hesse SIC. Here the extremal orbit is the one with the smallest number of pure states. Quite surprisingly, this characterization does not rely on any concept that is related to bases or unbiasedness. As a corollary, the canonical MUB is the unique minimal 2-design covariant with respect to the Clifford group except in dimension 3. In addition, these MUB provide an infinite family of highly symmetric frames and positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), which are of independent interest."

We present a method for distinguishing between unitary and non-unitary errors in quantum gates by interleaving repetitions of a target gate within a randomized benchmarking sequence. The benchmarking fidelity decays quadratically with the number of interleaved gates for unitary errors but linearly for non-unitary, allowing us to separate systematic coherent errors from decoherent effects. With this protocol we show that the fidelity of the gates is not limited by unitary errors, but by another drive-activated source of decoherence such as amplitude fluctuations."

Our algorithm works in time polynomial in the number of equations and the logarithm of the size of the field, whenever the degree of the polynomial equations is constant. As a consequence we design polynomial time quantum algorithms for two algebraic hidden structure problems: for the hidden subgroup problem in certain semidirect product p-groups of constant nilpotency class, and for the multi-dimensional univariate hidden polynomial graph problem when the degree of the polynomials is constant."

Recently, it has been shown that there is a formal connection between the dynamics of open quantum systems and the statistical mechanics in an extra dimension. This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics generates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible quantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions in the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of continuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad master equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which encodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed total observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates trajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events into the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an interesting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different ensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by total number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of different thermodynamic ensembles, akin to ""grand-canonical"" and ""isobaric"", but for trajectories. Here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are equivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps. This is in direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence between ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit. An intrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all observables that commute with the number of quantum jumps."

We apply this to several quantum oracle problems, including the GROUP MULTIPLICATION problem, in which the product of an ordered $n$-tuple of group elements is to be determined by querying elements of the tuple. For any finite group $G$, we give an algorithm to find the product of two elements of $G$ with a single quantum query with probability $2/|G|$. This generalizes Deutsch's Algorithm from $Z_2$ to an arbitrary finite group. We further prove that this algorithm is optimal. We also introduce the HIDDEN CONJUGATING ELEMENT PROBLEM, in which the oracle acts by conjugating by an unknown element of the group. We show that for many groups, including dihedral and symmetric groups, the unknown element can be determined with probability $1$ using a single quantum query."

Within the set of passive states, thermal states are the most stable ones: they maximize the entropy for a given energy, and similarly they minimize the energy for a given entropy. Here we find the passive states lying in the other extreme, i.e., those that maximize the energy for a given entropy, which we show also minimize the entropy when the energy is fixed. These extremal properties make these states useful to obtain fundamental bounds for the thermodynamics of finite-dimensional quantum systems, which we show in several scenarios."

With its origin in quantum information and in the differential geometry perspective of quantum states, the fidelity susceptibility can indicate the presence of a phase transition without prior knowledge of the local order parameter, as well as reveal the universal properties of a critical point. The wide applicability of the fidelity susceptibility to quantum many-body systems is, however, hindered by the limited computational tools to evaluate it. We present a generic, efficient, and elegant approach to compute the fidelity susceptibility of correlated fermions, bosons, and quantum spin systems in a broad range of quantum Monte Carlo methods. It can be applied both to the ground-state and non-zero temperature cases. The Monte Carlo estimator has a simple yet universal form, which can be efficiently evaluated in simulations. We demonstrate the power of this approach with applications to the Bose-Hubbard model, the spin-$1/2$ XXZ model, and use it to examine the hypothetical intermediate spin-liquid phase in the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice."

This cone has been introduced to model quantum graph parameters as conic optimization problems. Recently it has also been used to characterize the set $\mathcal Q$ of bipartite quantum correlations, as projection of an affine section of it. We have two main results concerning the structure of the completely positive semidefinite cone, namely about its interior and about its closure. On the one hand we construct a hierarchy of polyhedral cones which covers the interior of $\mathcal{CS}_+^n$, which we use for computing some variants of the quantum chromatic number by way of a linear program. On the other hand we give an explicit description of the closure of the completely positive semidefinite cone, by showing that it consists of all matrices admitting a Gram representation in the tracial ultraproduct of matrix algebras."

Quantum tomography, the standard tool used for this purpose, uses a well-designed measurement record to reconstruct quantum states and processes. It is, however, notoriously inefficient. Recently, the classical signal reconstruction technique known as ""compressed sensing"" has been ported to quantum information science to overcome this challenge: accurate tomography can be achieved with substantially fewer measurement settings, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of quantum tomography. Here we show that compressed sensing tomography of quantum systems is essentially guaranteed by a special property of quantum mechanics itself---that the mathematical objects that describe the system in quantum mechanics are matrices with nonnegative eigenvalues. This result has an impact on the way quantum tomography is understood and implemented. In particular, it implies that the information obtained about a quantum system through compressed sensing methods exhibits a new sense of ""informational completeness."" This has important consequences on the efficiency of data taking for quantum tomography, and enables us to construct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and modeling errors. Moreover, our result shows that one can expand the numerical tool-box used in quantum tomography and employ highly efficient algorithms developed to handle large dimensional matrices on a large dimensional Hilbert space. While we mainly present our results in the context of quantum tomography, they apply to the general case of positive semidefinite matrix recovery."
1463,1501.07417,2015,2,3,12,An improved rate region for the classical-quantum broadcast channel,Christoph Hirche;Ciara Morgan,We present a new achievable rate region for the two-user binary-input classical-quantum broadcast channel. The result is a generalization of the classical Marton-Gelfand-Pinsker region and is provably larger than the best previously known rate region for classical-quantum broadcast channels. The proof of achievability is based on the recently introduced polar coding scheme and its generalization to quantum network information theory.
1464,1501.06786,2015,1,30,12,Variational Matrix Product Operators for the Steady State of Dissipative Quantum Systems,Jian Cui;J Ignacio Cirac;Mari-Carmen Bañuls,"We present a new variational method, based on the matrix product operator (MPO) ansatz, for finding the steady state of dissipative quantum chains governed by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of requiring an accurate representation of the system evolution until the stationary state is attained, the algorithm directly targets the final state, thus allowing for a faster convergence when the steady state is a MPO with small bond dimension. Our numerical simulations for several dissipative spin models over a wide range of parameters illustrate the performance of the method and show that indeed the stationary state is often well described by a MPO of very moderate dimensions."

Unfortunately, the technological challenges associated with building a full-scale quantum computer have not yet allowed the experimental verification of such an expectation. Recently, boson sampling has emerged as a problem that is suspected to be intractable on any classical computer, but efficiently implementable with a linear quantum optical setup. Therefore, boson sampling may offer an experimentally realizable challenge to the Extended Church-Turing thesis and this remarkable possibility motivated much of the interest around boson sampling, at least in relation to complexity-theoretic questions. In this work, we show that the successful development of a boson sampling apparatus would not only answer such inquiries, but also yield a practical tool for difficult molecular computations. Specifically, we show that a boson sampling device with a modified input state can be used to generate molecular vibronic spectra, including complicated effects such as Duschinsky rotations."
1466,1412.7112,2014,12,30,12,The quantum bit from relativity of simultaneity on an interferometer,Andrew J P Garner;Markus P Müller;Oscar C O Dahlsten,"The patterns of fringes produced by an interferometer have always been important testbeds for our best contemporary theories of physics. Historically, interference has been used to contrast quantum mechanics to classical physics, but recently experiments have been performed that test quantum theory against even more exotic alternatives. A physically motivated family of theories are those where the state space of a two-level system is given by a sphere of arbitrary dimension. This includes classical bits, and real, complex and quaternionic quantum theory. In this paper, we consider relativity of simultaneity (that observers may disagree about the order of events at different locations) as applied to a two-armed interferometer. We show that this forbids most interference phenomena more complicated than those of standard complex quantum theory. In this sense, special relativity itself can be used to explain why physics should be described by the rules of quantum theory in this setup. Moreover, our result has consequences for actual interference experiments that are currently performed in the lab: they have to be designed carefully to avoid rendering beyond-quantum effects invisible by relativity of simultaneity."
1467,1412.5605,2014,12,23,12,Local constants of motion imply information propagation,M Friesdorf;A H Werner;M Goihl;Jens Eisert;W Brown,"Interacting quantum many-body systems are usually expected to thermalise, in the sense that the evolution of local expectation values approach a stationary value resembling a thermal ensemble. This intuition is notably contradicted in systems exhibiting many-body localisation, a phenomenon receiving significant recent attention. One of its most intriguing features is that, in stark contrast to the non-interacting case, entanglement of states grows without limit over time, albeit slowly. In this work, we establish a novel link between quantum information theory and notions of condensed matter, capturing the phenomenon in the Heisenberg picture. We show that the existence of local constants of motion, often taken as the defining property of many-body localisation, together with a generic spectrum, is sufficient to rigorously prove information propagation: These systems can be used to send a signal over arbitrary distances, in that the impact of a local perturbation can be detected arbitrarily far away. We perform a detailed perturbation analysis of quasi-local constants of motion and also show that they indeed can be used to construct efficient spectral tensor networks, as recently suggested. Our results provide a detailed and model-independent picture of information propagation in many-body localised systems."
1468,1411.7925,2014,12,19,12,Alignment of Polarized Sets,Joseph M Renes;David Sutter;S Hamed Hassani,"Arıkan's polar coding technique is based on the idea of synthesizing $n$ channels from the $n$ instances of the physical channel by a simple linear encoding transformation. Each synthesized channel corresponds to a particular input to the encoder. For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either essentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much information as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by transmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels. Unfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels is poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying physical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient to determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete memoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the other. Understanding the alignment of the polarized sets is important as it is directly related to universality properties of the induced polar codes, which are essential in particular for network coding problems. We demonstrate the performance of our conditions on a few examples for wiretap and broadcast channels. Finally we show that these conditions imply that the simple quantum polar coding scheme of Renes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050504 (2012)] requires entanglement assistance for general channels, but also show such assistance to be unnecessary in many cases of interest."
1469,1411.6379,2014,12,1,12,Scalable reconstruction of unitary processes and Hamiltonians,M Holzäpfel;T Baumgratz;Marcus Cramer;Martin B Plenio,"Based on recently introduced efficient quantum state tomography schemes, we propose a scalable method for the tomography of unitary processes and the reconstruction of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians. As opposed to the exponential scaling with the number of subsystems of standard quantum process tomography, the method relies only on measurements of linearly many local observables and either (a) the ability to prepare eigenstates of locally informationally complete operators or (b) access to an ancilla of the same size as the to-be-characterized system and the ability to prepare a maximally entangled state on the combined system. As such, the method requires at most linearly many states to be prepared and linearly many observables to be measured. The quality of the reconstruction can be quantified with the same experimental resources that are required to obtain the reconstruction in the first place. Our numerical simulations of several quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians suggest a polynomial scaling of the total number of measurements and post-processing resources."
1470,1411.5399,2014,11,25,12,Characterizing multipartite entanglement without shared reference frames,Claude Klöckl;Marcus Huber,Multipartite entanglement constitutes one of the key resources in quantum information processing. We exploit correlation tensor norms to develop a framework for its experimental detection without the need for shared frames of reference. By bounding these norms for partially separable states and states of limited dimension we achieve an extensive characterization of entanglement in multipartite systems in an experimentally feasible way. Furthermore we show that both bi- and multipartite dimensionality of entanglement can be revealed by our methods.
1471,1411.4777,2014,11,21,12,Overcoming efficiency constraints on blind quantum computation,Carlos A Pérez-Delgado;Joseph F Fitzsimons,"Blind quantum computation allows a user to delegate a computation to an untrusted server while keeping the computation hidden. A number of recent works have sought to establish bounds on the communication requirements necessary to implement blind computation, and a bound based on the no-programming theorem of Nielsen and Chuang has emerged as a natural limiting factor. Here we show that this constraints only hold in limited scenarios and show how to overcome it using a method based on iterated gate-teleportations. We present our results as a family of protocols, with varying degrees of computational-ability requirements on the client. Certain protocols in this family exponentially outperform previously known schemes in terms of total communication. The approach presented here can be adapted to other distributed computing protocols to reduce communication requirements."
1472,1411.2607,2014,11,19,12,Truncating an exact Matrix Product State for the XY model: transfer matrix and its renormalisation,Marek M Rams;Valentin Zauner;Matthias Bal;Jutho Haegeman;Frank Verstraete,"We discuss how to analytically obtain an -- essentially infinite -- Matrix Product State (MPS) representation of the ground state of the XY model. On the one hand this allows to illustrate how the Ornstein-Zernike form of the correlation function emerges in the exact case using standard MPS language. On the other hand we study the consequences of truncating the bond dimension of the exact MPS, which is also part of many tensor network algorithms, and analyze how the truncated MPS transfer matrix is representing the dominant part of the exact quantum transfer matrix. In the gapped phase we observe that the correlation length obtained from a truncated MPS approaches the exact value following a power law in effective bond dimension. In the gapless phase we find a good match between a state obtained numerically from standard MPS techniques with finite bond dimension, and a state obtained by effective finite imaginary time evolution in our framework. This provides a direct hint for a geometric interpretation of Finite Entanglement Scaling at the critical point in this case. Finally, by analyzing the spectra of transfer matrices, we support the interpretation put forward by [V. Zauner at. al., New J. Phys. 17, 053002 (2015)] that the MPS transfer matrix emerges from the quantum transfer matrix though the application of Wilson's Numerical Renormalisation Group along the imaginary-time direction."
1473,1411.0936,2014,11,12,12,Quantum State Transfer through Noisy Quantum Cellular Automata,Michele Avalle;Marco G Genoni;Alessio Serafini,"We model the transport of an unknown quantum state on one dimensional qubit lattices by means of a quantum cellular automata evolution. We do this by first introducing a class of discrete noisy dynamics, in the first excitation sector, in which a wide group of classical stochastic dynamics is embedded within the more general formalism of quantum operations. We then extend the Hilbert space of the system to accommodate a global vacuum state, thus allowing for the transport of initial on-site coherences besides excitations, and determine the dynamical constraints that define the class of noisy quantum cellular automata in this subspace. We then study the transport performance through numerical simulations, showing that for some instances of the dynamics perfect quantum state transfer is attainable. Our approach provides one with a natural description of both unitary and open quantum evolutions, where the homogeneity and locality of interactions allow one to take into account several forms of quantum noise in a plausible scenario."
1474,1409.8217,2014,11,5,12,Interconversion of pure Gaussian states using non-Gaussian operations,Michael G Jabbour;Raúl García-Patrón;Nicolas J Cerf,"We analyze the conditions under which local operations and classical communication enable entanglement transformations within the set of bipartite pure Gaussian states. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions had been found in [Quant. Inf. Comp. 3, 211 (2003)] for the interconversion between such states that is restricted to Gaussian local operations and classical communication. Here, we exploit majorization theory in order to derive more general (sufficient) conditions for the interconversion between bipartite pure Gaussian states that goes beyond Gaussian local operations. While our technique is applicable to an arbitrary number of modes for each party, it allows us to exhibit surprisingly simple examples of 2 x 2 Gaussian states that necessarily require non-Gaussian local operations to be transformed into each other."
1475,1409.7845,2014,9,30,12,Beyond heat baths II: Framework for generalized thermodynamic resource theories,Nicole Yunger Halpern,"Thermodynamics, which describes vast systems, has been reconciled with small scales, relevant to single-molecule experiments, in resource theories. Resource theories have been used to model exchanges of energy and information. Recently, particle exchanges were modeled; and an umbrella family of thermodynamic resource theories was proposed to model diverse baths, interactions, and free energies. This paper motivates and details the family's structure and prospective applications. How to model electrochemical, gravitational, magnetic, and other thermodynamic systems is explained. Szilard's engine and Landauer's Principle are generalized, as resourcefulness is shown to be convertible not only between information and gravitational energy, but also among diverse degrees of freedom. Extensive variables are associated with quantum operators that might fail to commute, introducing extra nonclassicality into thermodynamic resource theories. This generalization expands the theories' potential for modeling realistic systems with which small-scale statistical mechanics might be tested experimentally."

Owing to the imperfections of real-life implementations, however, there is a big gap between the theory and practice of QKD, which has been recently exploited by several quantum hacking activities. To fill this gap, a novel approach, called measurement-device-independent QKD (mdiQKD), has been proposed. It can remove all side-channels from the measurement unit, arguably the most vulnerable part in QKD systems, thus offering a clear avenue towards secure QKD realisations. Here, we review the latest developments in the framework of mdiQKD, together with its assumptions, strengths and weaknesses."
1477,1409.3562,2014,9,19,12,Strong converse exponent for classical-quantum channel coding,Milán Mosonyi;Tomohiro Ogawa,"We determine the exact strong converse exponent of classical-quantum channel coding, for every rate above the Holevo capacity. Our form of the exponent is an exact analogue of Arimoto's, given as a transform of the Renyi capacities with parameters alpha>1. It is important to note that, unlike in the classical case, there are many inequivalent ways to define the Renyi divergence of states, and hence the Rényi capacities of channels. Our exponent is in terms of the Renyi capacities corresponding to a version of the Renyi divergences that has been introduced recently in [Müller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J. Math. Phys. 54, 122203, (2013)], and [Wilde, Winter, Yang, Commun. Math. Phys. 331, (2014)]. Our result adds to the growing body of evidence that this new version is the natural definition for the purposes of strong converse problems."

We review the notion of security necessary for a protocol to be usable in a larger cryptographic context, i.e., for it to remain secure when composed with other secure protocols. We then derive the corresponding security criterion for QKD. We provide several examples of QKD composed in sequence and parallel with different cryptographic schemes to illustrate how the error of a composed protocol is the sum of the errors of the individual protocols. We also discuss the operational interpretations of the distance metric used to quantify these errors."

In this paper, we examine certain types of symmetric promises, and show that they also cannot give rise to super-polynomial quantum speedups. We conclude that exponential quantum speedups only occur given ""structured"" promises on the input. Specifically, we show that there is a polynomial relationship of degree $12$ between $D(f)$ and $Q(f)$ for any function $f$ defined on permutations (elements of $\{0,1,\dots, M-1\}^n$ in which each alphabet element occurs exactly once). We generalize this result to all functions $f$ defined on orbits of the symmetric group action $S_n$ (which acts on an element of $\{0,1,\dots, M-1\}^n$ by permuting its entries). We also show that when $M$ is constant, any function $f$ defined on a ""symmetric set"" - one invariant under $S_n$ - satisfies $R(f)=O(Q(f)^{12(M-1)})$."

This method achieves a bound of $O(k)$ gates using at most one ancilla using decomposition into $1$- and $2$-level matrices which was first proposed by Giles and Selinger."

Nevertheless, all known such examples consider games where the two parties have a common interest, since they jointly win or lose the game. The main question we ask here is whether the nonlocal feature of quantum mechanics can offer an advantage in a scenario where the two parties have conflicting interests. We answer this in the affirmative by presenting a simple conflicting interest game, where quantum strategies outperform classical ones. Moreover, we show that our game has a fair quantum equilibrium with higher payoffs for both players than in any fair classical equilibrium. Finally, we play the game using a commercial entangled photon source and demonstrate experimentally the quantum advantage."

Here we propose a new perspective for studying quantum entanglement: distributed computation of functions without communication between nodes. To formalize this approach, we propose identity games. Surprisingly, despite of no-signaling, we obtain that non-local quantum strategies beat classical ones in terms of winning probability for identity games originating from certain bipartite and multipartite functions. Moreover we show that, for majority of functions, access to general non-signaling resources boosts success probability two times in comparison to classical ones, for number of outputs large enough."

In this paper, using the so-called SWAP concept introduced recently, we show how one can remove this assumption in realistic experimental conditions and nevertheless be able to characterize the produced multipartite state based only on observed statistics. Such a black box tomography of quantum states is termed self-testing. As a function of the magnitude of the Bell violation, we are able to self-test emblematic multipartite quantum states such as the three-qubit W state, the three- and four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, and the four-qubit linear cluster state."

Here however we show that in quantum mechanics this is not true! We find instances when three quantum particles are put in two boxes, yet no two particles are in the same box. Furthermore, we show that the above ""quantum pigeonhole principle"" is only one of a host of related quantum effects, and points to a very interesting structure of quantum mechanics that was hitherto unnoticed. Our results shed new light on the very notions of separability and correlations in quantum mechanics and on the nature of interactions. It also presents a new role for entanglement, complementary to the usual one. Finally, interferometric experiments that illustrate our effects are proposed."

The global nature of topological ordering makes these phases robust and hence promising for applications. However, the non-locality of this ordering makes direct experimental studies an outstanding challenge, even in the simplest model topological systems, and interactions among the constituent particles adds to this challenge. Here we demonstrate a novel dynamical method to explore topological phases in both interacting and non-interacting systems, by employing the exquisite control afforded by state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits. We utilize this method to experimentally explore the well-known Haldane model of topological phase transitions by directly measuring the topological invariants of the system. We construct the topological phase diagram of this model and visualize the microscopic evolution of states across the phase transition, tasks whose experimental realizations have remained elusive. Furthermore, we developed a new qubit architecture that allows simultaneous control over every term in a two-qubit Hamiltonian, with which we extend our studies to an interacting Hamiltonian and discover the emergence of an interaction-induced topological phase. Our implementation, involving the measurement of both global and local textures of quantum systems, is close to the original idea of quantum simulation as envisioned by R. Feynman, where a controllable quantum system is used to investigate otherwise inaccessible quantum phenomena. This approach demonstrates the potential of superconducting qubits for quantum simulation and establishes a powerful platform for the study of topological phases in quantum systems."

In spite of a classical feature of diagonal quantum circuits in the sense of commutativity of all gates, their computational power is highly likely to outperform classical one and they are exploited for applications in quantum informational tasks. We review computational power of diagonal quantum circuits and their applications. We focus on the computational power of instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits, which are a special type of diagonal quantum circuits. We then review an approximate generation of random states as an application of diagonal quantum circuits, where random states are an ensemble of pure states uniformly distributed in a Hilbert space. We also present a thermalizing algorithm of classical Hamiltonians by using diagonal quantum circuits. These applications are feasible to be experimentally implemented by current technology due to a simple and robust structure of diagonal gates."
1488,1405.4811,2014,5,27,12,Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories with continuous groups,Luca Tagliacozzo;Alessio Celi;Maciej Lewenstein,We discuss how to formulate lattice gauge theories in the Tensor Network language. In this way we obtain both a consistent truncation scheme of the Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theories and a Tensor Network variational ansatz for gauge invariant states that can be used in actual numerical computation. Our construction is also applied to the simplest realization of the quantum link models/gauge magnets and provides a clear way to understand their microscopic relation with Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theories. We also introduce a new set of gauge invariant operators that modify continuously Rokshar-Kivelson wave functions and can be used to extend the phase diagram of known models. As an example we characterize the transition between the deconfined phase of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory and the Rokshar-Kivelson point of the U(1) gauge magnet in 2D in terms of entanglement entropy. The topological entropy serves as an order parameter for the transition but not the Schmidt gap.
1489,1405.1797,2014,5,20,12,On the Second-Order Asymptotics for Entanglement-Assisted Communication,Nilanjana Datta;Marco Tomamichel;Mark M Wilde,"The entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel is known to provide the formal quantum generalization of Shannon's classical channel capacity theorem, in the sense that it admits a single-letter characterization in terms of the quantum mutual information and does not increase in the presence of a noiseless quantum feedback channel from receiver to sender. In this work, we investigate second-order asymptotics of the entanglement-assisted classical communication task. That is, we consider how quickly the rates of entanglement-assisted codes converge to the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a channel as a function of the number of channel uses and the error tolerance. We define a quantum generalization of the mutual information variance of a channel in the entanglement-assisted setting. For covariant channels, we show that this quantity is equal to the channel dispersion, and thus completely characterize the convergence towards the entanglement-assisted classical capacity when the number of channel uses increases. Our results also apply to entanglement-assisted quantum communication, due to the equivalence between entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communication established by the teleportation and super-dense coding protocols."
1490,1405.1454,2014,5,9,12,Scalable extraction of error models from the output of error detection circuits,Austin G Fowler;D Sank;Julian Kelly;R Barends;John M Martinis,"Accurate methods of assessing the performance of quantum gates are extremely important. Quantum process tomography and randomized benchmarking are the current favored methods. Quantum process tomography gives detailed information, but significant approximations must be made to reduce this information to a form quantum error correction simulations can use. Randomized benchmarking typically outputs just a single number, the fidelity, giving no information on the structure of errors during the gate. Neither method is optimized to assess gate performance within an error detection circuit, where gates will be actually used in a large-scale quantum computer. Specifically, the important issues of error composition and error propagation lie outside the scope of both methods. We present a fast, simple, and scalable method of obtaining exactly the information required to perform effective quantum error correction from the output of continuously running error detection circuits, enabling accurate prediction of large-scale behavior."
1491,1405.1062,2014,5,8,12,On state vs. channel quantum extension problems: exact results for UxUxU symmetry,Peter Johnson;Lorenza Viola,"We develop a framework which unifies seemingly different extension (or ""joinability"") problems for bipartite quantum states and channels. This includes well known extension problems such as optimal quantum cloning and quantum marginal problems as special instances. Central to our generalization is a variant of the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism between bipartite states and dynamical maps which we term the ""homocorrelation map"": while the former emphasizes the preservation of the positivity constraint, the latter is designed to preserve statistical correlations, allowing direct contact with entanglement. In particular, we define and analyze state-joining, channel-joining, and local-positive joining problems in three-party settings exhibiting collective UxUxU symmetry, obtaining exact analytical characterizations in low dimension. Suggestively, we find that bipartite quantum states are limited in the degree to which their measurement outcomes may agree, while quantum channels are limited in the degree to which their measurement outcomes may disagree. Loosely speaking, quantum mechanics enforces an upper bound on the extent of positive correlation across a bipartite system at a given time, as well as on the extent of negative correlation between the state of a same system across two instants of time. We argue that these general statistical bounds inform the quantum joinability limitations, and show that they are in fact sufficient for the three-party UxUxU-invariant setting."

In this paper, drawing inspirations from it, we provide strong converses for protocols involving LOCC (local operations and classical communication). The key quantity that we work with is the Rényi relative entropy of entanglement. We provide a strong converse for the quantum state merging protocol that gives an exponential decay of the fidelity of the protocol for rates below the optimum with the number of copies of the state and are provided both for entanglement rate with LOCC as well as for classical communication with one-way LOCC. As an aside, the developments also yield short strong converses for the entanglement-concentration of pure states and the Schumacher compression."

1495,1403.7062,2014,4,4,12,Some inequalities for quantum Tsallis entropy related to the strong subadditivity,Dénes Petz;Dániel Virosztek,"In this paper we investigate the inequality $S_q(\rho_{123})+S_q(\rho_2)\leq S_q(\rho_{12})+S_q(\rho_{23}) \, (*)$ where $\rho_{123}$ is a state on a finite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1\otimes \mathcal{H}_2\otimes \mathcal{H}_3,$ and $S_q$ is the Tsallis entropy. It is well-known that the strong subadditivity of the von Neumnann entropy can be derived from the monotonicity of the Umegaki relative entropy. Now, we present an equivalent form of $(*)$, which is an inequality of relative quasi-entropies. We derive an inequality of the form $S_q(\rho_{123})+S_q(\rho_2)\leq S_q(\rho_{12})+S_q(\rho_{23})+f_q(\rho_{123})$, where $f_1(\rho_{123})=0$. Such a result can be considered as a generalization of the strong subadditivity of the von Neumnann entropy. One can see that $(*)$ does not hold in general (a picturesque example is included in this paper), but we give a sufficient condition for this inequality, as well."
1496,1403.6361,2014,4,3,12,Weak locking capacity of quantum channels can be much larger than private capacity,Andreas Winter,"We show that it is possible for the so-called weak locking capacity of a quantum channel [Guha et al., PRX 4:011016, 2014] to be much larger than its private capacity. Both reflect different ways of capturing the notion of reliable communication via a quantum system while leaking almost no information to an eavesdropper; the difference is that the latter imposes an intrinsically quantum security criterion whereas the former requires only a weaker, classical condition. The channels for which this separation is most straightforward to establish are the complementary channels of classical-quantum (cq-)channels, and hence a subclass of Hadamard channels. We also prove that certain symmetric channels (related to photon number splitting) have positive weak locking capacity in the presence of a vanishingly small pre-shared secret, whereas their private capacity is zero. These findings are powerful illustrations of the difference between two apparently natural notions of privacy in quantum systems, relevant also to quantum key distribution (QKD): the older, naive one based on accessible information, contrasting with the new, composable one embracing the quantum nature of the eavesdropper's information. Assuming an additivity conjecture for constrained minimum output Renyi entropies, the techniques of the first part demonstrate a single-letter formula for the weak locking capacity of complements to cq-channels, coinciding with a general upper bound of Guha et al. for these channels. Furthermore, still assuming this additivity conjecture, this upper bound is given an operational interpretation for general channels as the maximum weak locking capacity of the channel activated by a suitable noiseless channel."
1497,1402.5674,2014,3,28,12,Computational Complexity and Black Hole Horizons,Leonard Susskind,"Computational complexity is essential to understanding the properties of black hole horizons. The problem of Alice creating a firewall behind the horizon of Bob's black hole is a problem of computational complexity. In general we find that while creating firewalls is possible, it is extremely difficult and probably impossible for black holes that form in sudden collapse, and then evaporate. On the other hand if the radiation is bottled up then after an exponentially long period of time firewalls may be common. It is possible that gravity will provide tools to study problems of complexity; especially the range of complexity between scrambling and exponential complexity."
1498,1402.4797,2014,3,26,12,Physical Randomness Extractors: Generating Random Numbers with Minimal Assumptions,Kai-Min Chung;Yaoyun Shi;Xiaodi Wu,"How to generate provably true randomness with minimal assumptions? This question is important not only for the efficiency and the security of information processing, but also for understanding how extremely unpredictable events are possible in Nature. All current solutions require special structures in the initial source of randomness, or a certain independence relation among two or more sources. Both types of assumptions are impossible to test and difficult to guarantee in practice. Here we show how this fundamental limit can be circumvented by extractors that base security on the validity of physical laws and extract randomness from untrusted quantum devices. In conjunction with the recent work of Miller and Shi (arXiv:1402:0489), our physical randomness extractor uses just a single and general weak source, produces an arbitrarily long and near-uniform output, with a close-to-optimal error, secure against all-powerful quantum adversaries, and tolerating a constant level of implementation imprecision. The source necessarily needs to be unpredictable to the devices, but otherwise can even be known to the adversary. Our central technical contribution, the Equivalence Lemma, provides a general principle for proving composition security of untrusted-device protocols. It implies that unbounded randomness expansion can be achieved simply by cross-feeding any two expansion protocols. In particular, such an unbounded expansion can be made robust, which is known for the first time. Another significant implication is, it enables the secure randomness generation and key distribution using public randomness, such as that broadcast by NIST's Randomness Beacon. Our protocol also provides a method for refuting local hidden variable theories under a weak assumption on the available randomness for choosing the measurement settings."
1499,1402.3279,2014,2,25,12,Variations on Classical and Quantum Extractors,Mario Berta;Omar Fawzi;Volkher B Scholz;Oleg Szehr,"Many constructions of randomness extractors are known to work in the presence of quantum side information, but there also exist extractors which do not [Gavinsky \it et al., STOC'07]. Here we find that spectral extractors $\psi$ with a bound on the second largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{2}(\psi^{\dagger}\circ\psi)$ are quantum-proof. We then discuss fully quantum extractors and call constructions that also work in the presence of quantum correlations decoupling. As in the classical case we show that spectral extractors are decoupling. The drawback of classical and quantum spectral extractors is that they always have a long seed, whereas there exist classical extractors with exponentially smaller seed size. For the quantum case, we show that there exists an extractor with extremely short seed size $d=O(\log(1/\epsilon))$, where $\epsilon>0$ denotes the quality of the randomness. In contrast to the classical case this is independent of the input size and min-entropy and matches the simple lower bound $d\geq\log(1/\epsilon)$."

Its high threshold for single-qubit errors under stochastic noise is one of its most attrative features. We develop an exact formulation for the fidelity of the surface code that allows us to probe much further on this promise of strong protection. This formulation goes beyond the stochastic single-qubit error model approximation and can take into account both correlated errors and inhomogeneities in the coupling between physical qubits and the environment. For the case of a bit-flipping environment, we map the complete evolution after one quantum error correction cycle onto the problem of computing correlation functions of a two-dimensional Ising model with boundary fields. Exact results for the fidelity threshold of the surface code are then obtained for several relevant types of noise. Analytical predictions for a representative case are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations."

Furthermore, the controlled distribution of entanglement is of fundamental importance for quantum communication and computation. In many situations, quasiparticles are the carriers of information around a quantum system and are expected to distribute entanglement in a fashion determined by the system interactions. Here we report on the observation of magnon quasiparticle dynamics in a one-dimensional many-body quantum system of trapped ions representing an Ising spin model. Using the ability to tune the effective interaction range, and to prepare and measure the quantum state at the individual particle level, we observe new quasiparticle phenomena. For the first time, we reveal the entanglement distributed by quasiparticles around a many-body system. Second, for long-range interactions we observe the divergence of quasiparticle velocity and breakdown of the light-cone picture that is valid for short-range interactions. Our results will allow experimental studies of a wide range of phenomena, such as quantum transport, thermalisation, localisation and entanglement growth, and represent a first step towards a new quantum-optical regime with on-demand quasiparticles with tunable non-linear interactions."
1502,1401.4997,2014,1,28,12,Quantum speedup for active learning agents,Giuseppe Davide Paparo;Vedran Dunjko;Adi Makmal;Miguel Angel Martin-Delgado;Hans J Briegel,"Can quantum mechanics help us in building intelligent robots and agents? One of the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the capacity to learn from experience. However, a major bottleneck for agents to learn in any real-life situation is the size and complexity of the corresponding task environment. Owing to, e.g., a large space of possible strategies, learning is typically slow. Even for a moderate task environment, it may simply take too long to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is impatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be unable to cope with the situation and to learn at all. Here we show that quantum physics can help and provide a significant speed-up for active learning as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. We introduce a large class of quantum learning agents for which we show a quadratic boost in their active learning efficiency over their classical analogues. This result will be particularly relevant for applications involving complex task environments."
1503,1401.4495,2014,1,22,12,On the permutationally invariant part of a density matrix and nonseparability of N-qubit states,Ting Gao;Fengli Yan;S J van Enk,"We consider the concept of ""the permutationally invariant (PI) part of a density matrix,"" which has proven very useful for both efficient quantum state estimation and entanglement characterization of $N$-qubit systems. We show here that the concept is, in fact, basis-dependent, but that this basis dependence makes it an even more powerful concept than has been appreciated so far. By considering the PI part $\rho^{{\rm PI}}$ of a general (mixed) $N$-qubit state $\rho$, we obtain: (i) strong bounds on quantitative nonseparability measures, (ii) a whole hierarchy of multi-partite separability criteria (one of which entails a sufficient criterion for genuine $N$-partite entanglement) that can be experimentally determined by just $2N+1$ measurement settings, (iii) a definition of an efficiently measurable degree of separability, which can be used for quantifying a novel aspect of decoherence of $N$ qubits, and (iv) an explicit example that shows there are, for increasing $N$, genuinely $N$-partite entangled states lying closer and closer to the maximally mixed state. Moreover, we show that if the PI part of a state is $k$-nonseparable, then so is the actual state. We further argue to add as requirement on any multi-partite entanglement measure $E$ that it satisfy $E(\rho)\geq E(\rho^{{\rm PI}})$, even though the operation that maps $\rho\rightarrow\rho^{{\rm PI}}$ is not local."
1504,1401.4161,2014,1,21,12,Strong converse for the classical capacity of optical quantum communication channels,Bhaskar Roy Bardhan;Raúl García-Patrón;Mark M Wilde;Andreas Winter,"We establish the classical capacity of optical quantum channels as a sharp transition between two regimes---one which is an error-free regime for communication rates below the capacity, and the other in which the probability of correctly decoding a classical message converges exponentially fast to zero if the communication rate exceeds the classical capacity. This result is obtained by proving a strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of all phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels, a well-established model of optical quantum communication channels, such as lossy optical fibers, amplifier and free-space communication. The theorem holds under a particular photon-number occupation constraint, which we describe in detail in the paper. Our result bolsters the understanding of the classical capacity of these channels and opens the path to applications, such as proving the security of noisy quantum storage models of cryptography with optical links."
1505,1312.6793,2013,1,21,12,S matrix from matrix product states,Laurens Vanderstraeten;Jutho Haegeman;Tobias J Osborne;Frank Verstraete,"We use the matrix product state formalism to construct stationary scattering states of elementary excitations in generic one-dimensional quantum lattice systems. Our method is applied to the spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet, for which we calculate the full magnon-magnon S matrix for arbitrary momenta and spin, the two-particle contribution to the spectral function and the magnetization curve. As our method provides an accurate microscopic representation of the interaction between elementary excitations, we envisage the description of low-energy dynamics of one-dimensional spin chains in terms of these particlelike excitations."
1506,1312.3667,2013,1,17,12,The status of determinism in proofs of the impossibility of a noncontextual model of quantum theory,Robert W Spekkens,"In order to claim that one has experimentally tested whether a noncontextual ontological model could underlie certain measurement statistics in quantum theory, it is necessary to have a notion of noncontextuality that applies to unsharp measurements, i.e., those that can only be represented by positive operator-valued measures rather than projection-valued measures. This is because any realistic measurement necessarily has some nonvanishing amount of noise and therefore never achieves the ideal of sharpness. Assuming a generalized notion of noncontextuality that applies to arbitrary experimental procedures, it is shown that the outcome of a measurement depends deterministically on the ontic state of the system being measured if and only if the measurement is sharp. Hence for every unsharp measurement, its outcome necessarily has an indeterministic dependence on the ontic state. We defend this proposal against alternatives. In particular, we demonstrate why considerations parallel to Fine's theorem do not challenge this conclusion."
1507,1312.1463,2013,12,25,12,What we can learn about quantum physics from a single qubit,Wolfgang Dür;S Heusler,"We present an approach for teaching quantum physics at high school level based on the simplest quantum system - the single quantum bit (qubit). We show that many central concepts of quantum mechanics, including the superposition principle, the stochastic behavior and state change under measurements as well as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle can be understood using simple mathematics, and can be illustrated using catchy visualizations. We discuss abstract features of a qubit in general, and consider possible physical realizations as well as various applications, e.g. in quantum cryptography."
1508,1312.1027,2013,12,14,12,A Note on the Quantum Collision and Set Equality Problems,Mark Zhandry,"The results showing a quantum query complexity of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ for the collision problem do not apply to random functions. The issues are two-fold. First, the $\Omega(N^{1/3})$ lower bound only applies when the range is no larger than the domain, which precludes many of the cryptographically interesting applications. Second, most of the results in the literature only apply to $r$-to-1 functions, which are quite different from random functions. Understanding the collision problem for random functions is of great importance to cryptography, and we seek to fill the gaps of knowledge for this problem. To that end, we prove that, as expected, a quantum query complexity of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ holds for all interesting domain and range sizes. Our proofs are simple, and combine existing techniques with several novel tricks to obtain the desired results. Using our techniques, we also give an optimal $\Omega(N^{1/3})$ lower bound for the set equality problem. This new lower bound can be used to improve the relationship between classical randomized query complexity and quantum query complexity for so-called permutation-symmetric functions."

We explain its workings as based on adiabatic dragging of the subsystem containing the logical information around suitable loops along which the information remains protected.
1510,1311.0813,2013,12,5,12,Quantropy,John C Baez;Blake S Pollard,"There is a well-known analogy between statistical and quantum mechanics. In statistical mechanics, Boltzmann realized that the probability for a system in thermal equilibrium to occupy a given state is proportional to exp(-E/kT) where E is the energy of that state. In quantum mechanics, Feynman realized that the amplitude for a system to undergo a given history is proportional to exp(-S/i hbar) where S is the action of that history. In statistical mechanics we can recover Boltzmann's formula by maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected energy. This raises the question: what is the quantum mechanical analogue of entropy? We give a formula for this quantity, which we call ""quantropy"". We recover Feynman's formula from assuming that histories have complex amplitudes, that these amplitudes sum to one, and that the amplitudes give a stationary point of quantropy subject to a constraint on the expected action. Alternatively, we can assume the amplitudes sum to one and that they give a stationary point of a quantity we call ""free action"", which is analogous to free energy in statistical mechanics. We compute the quantropy, expected action and free action for a free particle, and draw some conclusions from the results."

The Quantum Lovász Local Lemma gives a sufficient condition for a Quantum Satisfiability problem to be satisfiable [AKS12], by generalizing the classical Lovász Local Lemma. The next natural question that arises is: can a satisfying quantum state be efficiently found, when these conditions hold? In this work we present such an algorithm, with the additional requirement that all the projectors commute. The proof follows the information theoretic proof given by Moser's breakthrough result in the classical setting [Mos09]. Similar results were independently published in [CS11,CSV13]."

In particular for these variables, derivatives of -Q are equal to derivatives of H of one higher order and the first derivatives of H and Q are seen to be completely monotone functions. It then follows that exp (-H) and exp(-Q) are Laplace transforms of infinitely divisible probability distributions."

1514,1310.4581,2013,10,25,12,"Quantum Side Information: Uncertainty Relations, Extractors, Channel Simulations",Mario Berta,"In the first part of this thesis, we discuss the algebraic approach to classical and quantum physics and develop information theoretic concepts within this setup. In the second part, we discuss the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The principle states that even if we have full classical information about the state of a quantum system, it is impossible to deterministically predict the outcomes of all possible measurements. In comparison, the perspective of a quantum observer allows to have quantum information about the state of a quantum system. This then leads to an interplay between uncertainty and quantum correlations. We provide an information theoretic analysis by discussing entropic uncertainty relations with quantum side information. In the third part, we discuss the concept of randomness extractors. Classical and quantum randomness are an essential resource in information theory, cryptography, and computation. However, most sources of randomness exhibit only weak forms of unpredictability, and the goal of randomness extraction is to convert such weak randomness into (almost) perfect randomness. We discuss various constructions for classical and quantum randomness extractors, and we examine especially the performance of these constructions relative to an observer with quantum side information. In the fourth part, we discuss channel simulations. Shannon's noisy channel theorem can be understood as the use of a noisy channel to simulate a noiseless one. Channel simulations as we want to consider them here are about the reverse problem: simulating noisy channels from noiseless ones. Starting from the purely classical case (the classical reverse Shannon theorem), we develop various kinds of quantum channel simulation results. We achieve this by using classical and quantum randomness extractors that also work with respect to quantum side information."
1515,1310.3846,2013,10,23,12,Decoding non-Abelian topological quantum memories,James R Wootton;Jan Burri;Sofyan Iblisdir;Daniel Loss,"The possibility of quantum computation using non-Abelian anyons has been considered for over a decade. However the question of how to obtain and process information about what errors have occurred in order to negate their effects has not yet been considered. This is in stark contrast with quantum computation proposals for Abelian anyons, for which decoding algorithms have been tailor-made for many topological error-correcting codes and error models. Here we address this issue by considering the properties of non-Abelian error correction in general. We also choose a specific anyon model and error model to probe the problem in more detail. The anyon model is the charge submodel of $D(S_3)$. This shares many properties with important models such as the Fibonacci anyons, making our method applicable in general. The error model is a straightforward generalization of those used in the case of Abelian anyons for initial benchmarking of error correction methods. It is found that error correction is possible under a threshold value of $7 \%$ for the total probability of an error on each physical spin. This is remarkably comparable with the thresholds for Abelian models."

The game has a perfect quantum strategy if and only if the constraint system has a quantum satisfying assignment [R. Cleve and R. Mittal, arXiv:1209.2729]. We show that several concepts including the quantum chromatic number and the Kochen-Specker sets that arose from different contexts fit naturally in the binary constraint system framework. The structure and complexity of the quantum satisfiability problems for these constraint systems are investigated. Combined with a new construct called the commutativity gadget for each problem, several classic NP-hardness reductions are lifted to their corresponding quantum versions. We also provide a simple parity constraint game that requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs in perfect strategies where $n$ is the number of variables in the constraint system."

We study the quantum query complexity of this problem, and show that any quantum algorithm that solves this problem with bounded error must make $\Omega(N^{1/5}/\log N)$ queries to the input function. Our lower bound proof uses a combination of the Collision Problem lower bound and Ambainis's adversary theorem."

The mathematical foundations of TDDFT are established through the formal existence of a fictitious non-interacting system (known as the Kohn-Sham system), which can reproduce the one-electron reduced probability density of the actual system. We build upon these works and show that on the interior of the domain of existence, the Kohn-Sham system can be efficiently obtained given the time-dependent density. Since a quantum computer can efficiently produce such time-dependent densities, we present a polynomial time quantum algorithm to generate the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential with controllable error bounds. As a consequence, in contrast to the known intractability result for ground state density functional theory (DFT), the computation of the necessary time-dependent potentials given the initial state is in the complexity class described by bounded error quantum computation in polynomial time (BQP)."

Although this raises the possibility that special purpose analog quantum simulators may be able to perform computational tasks that existing computers cannot, it also introduces a major challenge: certifying that the quantum simulator is in fact simulating the correct quantum dynamics. We provide an algorithm that, under relatively weak assumptions, can be used to efficiently infer the Hamiltonian of a large but untrusted quantum simulator using a trusted quantum simulator. We illustrate the power of this approach by showing numerically that it can inexpensively learn the Hamiltonians for large frustrated Ising models, demonstrating that quantum resources can make certifying analog quantum simulators tractable."

To date, several implementations were demonstrated, all of them assuming perfect noise-free environments. Here we consider measurement-based information processing in the presence of noise and demonstrate quantum error detection. We implement the protocol using a four-qubit photonic cluster state, where we first encode a general qubit non-locally such that phase errors can be detected. We then read out the error syndrome and analyze the output states after decoding. Our demonstration shows a building block for measurement-based quantum computing which is crucial for realistic scenarios."

The most prominent application is the one-way quantum computer, with the cluster state as its universal resource. Here we demonstrate the principles of MBQC using deterministically generated graph states of up to 7 qubits, in a system of trapped atomic ions. Firstly we implement a universal set of operations for quantum computing. Secondly we demonstrate a family of measurement-based quantum error correction codes, and show their improved performance as the code length is increased. We show that all our graph states violate a multipartite Bell inequality and are therefore capable of information processing tasks that cannot be described by a local hidden variable model. The methods presented can directly be scaled up to generate graph states of several tens of qubits."

In this context the notions of coexistence and joint measurability are employed to analyze the possibility of measuring together two general quantum observables, characterizing different degrees of compatibility between measurements. It is known that two jointly measurable observables are always coexistent, and that the converse holds for various classes of observables, including the case of observables with two outcomes. Here we resolve, in the negative, the open question whether this equivalence holds in general. Our resolution strengthens the notions of coexistence and joint measurability by showing that both are robust against small imperfections in the measurement setups."

These processes require high-fidelity state preparation as well as minimizing the decoherence that inevitably arises from coupling between the system and the environment and imperfect control of the system parameters. Here, on the contrary, we combine unitary processes with engineered dissipation to deterministically produce and stabilize an approximate Bell state of two trapped-ion qubits independent of their initial state. While previous works along this line involved the application of sequences of multiple time-dependent gates [3] or generated entanglement of atomic ensembles dissipatively but relied on a measurement record for steady-state entanglement [4], we implement the process in a continuous time-independent fashion, analogous to optical pumping of atomic states. By continuously driving the system towards steady-state, the entanglement is stabilized even in the presence of experimental noise and decoherence. Our demonstration of an entangled steady state of two qubits represents a step towards dissipative state engineering, dissipative quantum computation, and dissipative phase transitions [5-7]. Following this approach, engineered coupling to the environment may be applied to a broad range of experimental systems to achieve desired quantum dynamics or steady states. Indeed, concurrently with this work, an entangled steady state of two superconducting qubits was demonstrated using dissipation [8]."
1524,1307.0836,2013,7,29,12,Strong equivalence of reversible circuits is coNP-complete,Stephen P Jordan,"It is well-known that deciding equivalence of logic circuits is a coNP-complete problem. As a corollary, the problem of deciding weak equivalence of reversible circuits, i.e. ignoring the ancilla bits, is also coNP-complete. The complexity of deciding strong equivalence, including the ancilla bits, is less obvious and may depend on gate set. Here we use Barrington's theorem to show that deciding strong equivalence of reversible circuits built from the Fredkin gate is coNP-complete. This implies coNP-completeness of deciding strong equivalence for other commonly used universal reversible gate sets, including any gate set that includes the Toffoli or Fredkin gate."

Classical algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the number of vectors and the dimension of the space. Quantum computers are good at manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. This paper provides supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for cluster assignment and cluster finding. Quantum machine learning can take time logarithmic in both the number of vectors and their dimension, an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms."

Here we show that the unknown quantum state can play an active role in its own analysis. In particular, given multiple copies of a quantum system with density matrix \rho, then it is possible to perform the unitary transformation e^-i\rho t. As a result, one can create quantum coherence among different copies of the system to perform quantum principal component analysis, revealing the eigenvectors corresponding to the large eigenvalues of the unknown state in time exponentially faster than any existing algorithm."

We show how to use Knill's postselection scheme in a practical two-dimensional quantum architecture that we designed with the goal to optimize the error correction properties, while satisfying important architectural constraints. In our 2D architecture, one logical qubit is embedded in a tile consisting of $5\times 5$ physical qubits. The movement of these qubits is modeled as noisy SWAP gates and the only physical operations that are allowed are local one- and two-qubit gates. We evaluate the practical properties of our design, such as its error threshold, and compare it to the concatenated Bacon-Shor code and the concatenated Steane code. Assuming that all gates have the same error rates, we obtain a threshold of $3.06\times 10^{-4}$ in a local adversarial stochastic noise model, which is the highest known error threshold for concatenated codes in 2D. We also present a Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D architecture with depolarizing noise and we calculate a pseudo-threshold of about 0.1%. With memory error rates one-tenth of the worst gate error rates, the threshold for the adversarial noise model, and the pseudo-threshold over depolarizing noise, are $4.06\times 10^{-4}$ and 0.2%, respectively. In a hypothetical technology where memory error rates are negligible, these thresholds can be further increased by shrinking the tiles into a $4\times 4$ layout."

Here we study the behaviour of these models at thermal equilibrium. It is found that the interactions allow topological order to exist at finite temperature, not only in an extension of the ground state phase but also in a novel form of topologically ordered phase. Both phases are found to support self-correction in all models considered, and the transition between them corresponds to a change in the scaling of memory lifetime with system size."

We report optimal circuits for all Clifford operations with up to four inputs. We perform peep-hole optimization of Clifford circuits with up to 40 inputs found in the literature, and demonstrate the reduction in the number of gates by about 50%. We extend our methods to the optimal synthesis of linear reversible circuits, partially specified Clifford functions, and optimal Clifford circuits with five inputs up to input/output permutation. The results find their application in randomized benchmarking protocols, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit optimization."
1531,1304.7259,2013,5,9,12,Classification of multipartite entanglement in all dimensions,Gilad Gour;Nolan R Wallach,"We provide a systematic classification of multiparticle entanglement in terms of equivalence classes of states under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). We show that such an SLOCC equivalency class of states is characterized by ratios of homogenous polynomials that are invariant under local action of the special linear group. We then construct the complete set of all such SL-invariant polynomials (SLIPs). Our construction is based on Schur-Weyl duality and applies to any number of qudits in all (finite) dimensions. In addition, we provide an elegant formula for the dimension of the homogenous SLIPs space of a fixed degree as a function of the number of qudits. The expressions for the SLIPs involve in general many terms, but for the case of qubits we also provide much simpler expressions."
1532,1304.6100,2013,5,6,12,Fault-Tolerant Renormalization Group Decoder for Abelian Topological Codes,Guillaume Duclos-Cianci;David Poulin,"We present a three-dimensional generalization of a renormalization group decoding algorithm for topological codes with Abelian anyonic excitations that we previously introduced for two dimensions. This 3D implementation extends our previous 2D algorithm by incorporating a failure probability of the syndrome measurements, i.e., it enables fault-tolerant decoding. We report a fault-tolerant storage threshold of 1.9(4)% for Kitaev's toric code subject to a 3D bit-flip channel (i.e. including imperfect syndrome measurements). This number is to be compared with the 2.9% value obtained via perfect matching. The 3D generalization inherits many properties of the 2D algorithm, including a complexity linear in the space-time volume of the memory, which can be parallelized to logarithmic time."

We show that any read-once quantum formula over a gate set that contains all single-qubit gates is equivalent to a read-once classical formula of the same size and depth over an analogous classical gate set. For example, any read-once quantum formula over Toffoli and single-qubit gates is equivalent to a read-once classical formula over Toffoli and NOT gates. We then show that the equivalence does not hold if the read-once restriction is removed. To show the power of quantum formulas without the read-once restriction, we define a new model of computation called the one-qubit model and show that it can compute all boolean functions. This model may also be of independent interest."
1534,1303.6304,2013,4,23,12,Rapid mixing implies exponential decay of correlations,Michael J Kastoryano;Jens Eisert,"We provide an analysis of the correlation properties of spin and fermionic systems on a lattice evolving according to open system dynamics generated by a local primitive Liouvillian. We show that if the Liouvillian has a spectral gap which is independent of the system size, then the correlations between local observables decay exponentially as a function of the distance between their supports. We prove, furthermore, that if the Log-Sobolev constant is independent of the system size, then the system satisfies clustering of correlations in the mutual information - a much more stringent form of correlation decay. As a consequence, in the latter case we get an area law (with logarithmic corrections) for the mutual information. As a further corollary, we obtain a stability theorem for local distant perturbations. We also demonstrate that gapped free-fermionic systems exhibit clustering of correlations in the covariance and in the mutual information. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for the classical simulation of open quantum systems with matrix-product operators and the robust dissipative preparation of topologically ordered states of lattice spin systems."
1535,1303.2834,2013,4,19,12,Psi-Epistemic Theories: The Role of Symmetry,Scott Aaronson;Adam Bouland;Lynn Chua;George Lowther,"Formalizing an old desire of Einstein, ""psi-epistemic theories"" try to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, while viewing quantum states as ordinary probability distributions over underlying objects called ""ontic states."" Regardless of one's philosophical views about such theories, the question arises of whether one can cleanly rule them out, by proving no-go theorems analogous to the Bell Inequality. In the 1960s, Kochen and Specker (who first studied these theories) constructed an elegant psi-epistemic theory for Hilbert space dimension d=2, but also showed that any deterministic psi-epistemic theory must be ""measurement contextual"" in dimensions 3 and higher. Last year, the topic attracted renewed attention, when Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph (PBR) showed that any psi-epistemic theory must ""behave badly under tensor product."" In this paper, we prove that even without the Kochen-Specker or PBR assumptions, there are no psi-epistemic theories in dimensions d>=3 that satisfy two reasonable conditions: (1) symmetry under unitary transformations, and (2) ""maximum nontriviality"" (meaning that the probability distributions corresponding to any two non-orthogonal states overlap). This no-go theorem holds if the ontic space is either the set of quantum states or the set of unitaries. The proof of this result, in the general case, uses some measure theory and differential geometry. On the other hand, we also show the surprising result that without the symmetry restriction, one can construct maximally-nontrivial psi-epistemic theories in every finite dimension d."

We demonstrate here that entropy vectors for stabiliser states satisfy, in addition to the classic inequalities, a type of linear rank inequalities associated with the combinatorial structure of normal subgroups of certain matrix groups. In the 4-party case, there is only one such inequality, the so-called Ingleton inequality. For these systems we show that strong subadditivity, weak monotonicity and Ingleton inequality exactly characterize the entropy cone for stabiliser states."
1537,1302.5311,2013,3,13,12,Quantum Fisher Information as the Convex Roof of Variance,Sixia Yu,"Quantum Fisher information places the fundamental limit to the accuracy of estimating an unknown parameter. Here we shall provide the quantum Fisher information an operational meaning: a mixed state can be so prepared that a given observable has the minimal averaged variance, which equals exactly to the quantum Fisher information for estimating an unknown parameter generated by the unitary dynamics with the given observable as Hamiltonian. In particular we shall prove that the quantum Fisher information is the convex roof of the variance, as conjectured by Toth and Petz based on numerical and analytical evidences, by constructing explicitly a pure-state ensemble of the given mixed state in which the averaged variance of a given observable equals to the quantum Fisher information."
1538,1302.3998,2013,2,23,12,Dynamic Generation of Topologically Protected Self-Correcting Quantum Memory,Daniel Becker;Tetsufumi Tanamoto;Adrian Hutter;Fabio L Pedrocchi;Daniel Loss,"We propose a scheme to dynamically realize a quantum memory based on the toric code. The code is generated from qubit systems with typical two-body interactions (Ising, XY, Heisenberg) using periodic, NMR-like, pulse sequences. It allows one to encode the logical qubits without measurements and to protect them dynamically against the time evolution of the physical qubits. A weakly coupled cavity mode mediates a long-range attractive interaction between the stabilizer operators of the toric code, thereby suppressing the creation of thermal anyons. This significantly increases the lifetime of the memory compared to the code with noninteracting stabilizers. We investigate how the fidelity, with which the toric code is realized, depends on the period length T of the pulse sequence and the magnitude of possible pulse errors. We derive an optimal period T_opt that maximizes the fidelity."
1539,1301.4927,2013,2,22,12,"""Pretty strong"" converse for the quantum capacity of degradable channels",Ciara Morgan;Andreas Winter,"We exhibit a possible road towards a strong converse for the quantum capacity of degradable channels. In particular, we show that all degradable channels obey what we call a ""pretty strong"" converse: When the code rate increases above the quantum capacity, the fidelity makes a discontinuous jump from 1 to at most 0.707, asymptotically. A similar result can be shown for the private (classical) capacity. Furthermore, we can show that if the strong converse holds for symmetric channels (which have quantum capacity zero), then degradable channels obey the strong converse: The above-mentioned asymptotic jump of the fidelity at the quantum capacity is then from 1 down to 0."
1540,1301.3662,2013,2,19,12,Composable security of delegated quantum computation,Vedran Dunjko;Joseph F Fitzsimons;Christopher Portmann;Renato Renner,"Delegating difficult computations to remote large computation facilities, with appropriate security guarantees, is a possible solution for the ever-growing needs of personal computing power. For delegated computation protocols to be usable in a larger context---or simply to securely run two protocols in parallel---the security definitions need to be composable. Here, we define composable security for delegated quantum computation. We distinguish between protocols which provide only blindness---the computation is hidden from the server---and those that are also verifiable---the client can check that it has received the correct result. We show that the composable security definition capturing both these notions can be reduced to a combination of several distinct ""trace-distance-type"" criteria---which are, individually, non-composable security definitions. Additionally, we study the security of some known delegated quantum computation protocols, including Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi's Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol. Even though these protocols were originally proposed with insufficient security criteria, they turn out to still be secure given the stronger composable definitions."
1541,1210.3181,2012,1,22,12,Relative entropy and squashed entanglement,Ke Li;Andreas Winter,"We are interested in the properties and relations of entanglement measures. Especially, we focus on the squashed entanglement and relative entropy of entanglement, as well as their analogues and variants. Our first result is a monogamy-like inequality involving the relative entropy of entanglement and its one-way LOCC variant. The proof is accomplished by exploring the properties of relative entropy in the context of hypothesis testing via one-way LOCC operations, and by making use of an argument resembling that by Piani on the faithfulness of regularized relative entropy of entanglement. Following this, we obtain a commensurate and faithful lower bound for squashed entanglement, in the form of one-way LOCC relative entropy of entanglement. This gives a strengthening to the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy. Our result improves the trace-distance-type bound derived in [Comm. Math. Phys., 306:805-830, 2011], where faithfulness of squashed entanglement was first proved. Applying Pinsker's inequality, we are able to recover the trace-distance-type bound, even with slightly better constant factor. However, the main improvement is that our new lower bound can be much larger than the old one and it is almost a genuine entanglement measure. We evaluate exactly the various relative entropy of entanglement under restricted measurement classes, for maximally entangled states. Then, by proving asymptotic continuity, we extend the exact evaluation to their regularized versions for all pure states. Finally, we consider comparisons and separations between some important entanglement measures and obtain several new results on these, too."
1542,1210.1550,2012,1,17,12,Quantum Fourier Transforms and the Complexity of Link Invariants for Quantum Doubles of Finite Groups,Hari Krovi;Alexander Russell,"Knot and link invariants naturally arise from any braided Hopf algebra. We consider the computational complexity of the invariants arising from an elementary family of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras: quantum doubles of finite groups (denoted D(G), for a group G). Regarding algorithms for these invariants, we develop quantum circuits for the quantum Fourier transform over D(G); in general, we show that when one can uniformly and efficiently carry out the quantum Fourier transform over the centralizers Z(g) of the elements of G, one can efficiently carry out the quantum Fourier transform over D(G). We apply these results to the symmetric groups to yield efficient circuits for the quantum Fourier transform over D(S_n). With such a Fourier transform, it is straightforward to obtain additive approximation algorithms for the related link invariant. Additionally, we show that certain D(G) invariants (such as D(A_n) invariants) are BPP-hard to additively approximate, SBP-hard to multiplicatively approximate, and #P-hard to exactly evaluate. Finally, we make partial progress on the question of simulating anyonic computation in groups uniformly as a function of the group size. In this direction, we provide efficient quantum circuits for the Clebsch-Gordan transform over D(G) for ""fluxon"" irreps, i.e., irreps of D(G) characterized by a conjugacy class of G. For general irreps, i.e., those which are associated with a conjugacy class of G and an irrep of a centralizer, we present an efficient implementation under certain conditions such as when there is an efficient Clebsch-Gordan transform over the centralizers. We remark that this also provides a simulation of certain anyonic models of quantum computation, even in circumstances where the group may have size exponential in the size of the circuit."
1543,1210.1199,2012,10,12,12,Nested Quantum Walks with Quantum Data Structures,Stacey Jeffery;Robin Kothari;Frederic Magniez,"We develop a new framework that extends the quantum walk framework of Magniez, Nayak, Roland, and Santha, by utilizing the idea of quantum data structures to construct an efficient method of nesting quantum walks. Surprisingly, only classical data structures were considered before for searching via quantum walks. The recently proposed learning graph framework of Belovs has yielded improved upper bounds for several problems, including triangle finding and more general subgraph detection. We exhibit the power of our framework by giving a simple explicit constructions that reproduce both the $O(n^{35/27})$ and $O(n^{9/7})$ learning graph upper bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for triangle finding, and discuss how other known upper bounds in the original learning graph framework can be converted to algorithms in our framework. We hope that the ease of use of this framework will lead to the discovery of new upper bounds."
1544,1209.2423,2012,10,5,12,Reply to recent scepticism about the foundations of quantum cryptography,Renato Renner,"In a series of recent papers, Hirota and Yuen claim to have identified a fundamental flaw in the theory underlying quantum cryptography, which would invalidate existing security proofs. In this short note, we sketch their argument and show that their conclusion is unjustified --- it originates from a confusion between necessary and sufficient criteria for secrecy."
1545,1208.5334,2012,10,4,12,The Power of Noisy Fermionic Quantum Computation,Fernando de Melo;Piotr Ćwikliński;Barbara M Terhal,"We consider the realization of universal quantum computation through braiding of Majorana fermions supplemented by unprotected preparation of noisy ancillae. It has been shown by Bravyi [Phys. Rev. A 73, 042313 (2006)] that under the assumption of perfect braiding operations, universal quantum computation is possible if the noise rate on a particular 4-fermion ancilla is below 40%. We show that beyond a noise rate of 89% on this ancilla the quantum computation can be efficiently simulated classically: we explicitly show that the noisy ancilla is a convex mixture of Gaussian fermionic states in this region, while for noise rates below 53% we prove that the state is not a mixture of Gaussian states. These results were obtained by generalizing concepts in entanglement theory to the setting of Gaussian states and their convex mixtures. In particular we develop a complete set of criteria, namely the existence of a Gaussian-symmetric extension, which determine whether a state is a convex mixture of Gaussian states."
1546,1207.4939,2012,9,12,12,Quantum XOR Games,Oded Regev;Thomas Vidick,"We introduce quantum XOR games, a model of two-player one-round games that extends the model of XOR games by allowing the referee's questions to the players to be quantum states. We give examples showing that quantum XOR games exhibit a wide range of behaviors that are known not to exist for standard XOR games, such as cases in which the use of entanglement leads to an arbitrarily large advantage over the use of no entanglement. By invoking two deep extensions of Grothendieck's inequality, we present an efficient algorithm that gives a constant-factor approximation to the best performance players can obtain in a given game, both in case they have no shared entanglement and in case they share unlimited entanglement. As a byproduct of the algorithm we prove some additional interesting properties of quantum XOR games, such as the fact that sharing a maximally entangled state of arbitrary dimension gives only a small advantage over having no entanglement at all."
1547,1409.3305,2014,8,28,11,Fixed-point quantum search with an optimal number of queries,Theodore J Yoder;Guang Hao Low;Isaac L Chuang,"Grover's quantum search and its generalization, quantum amplitude amplification, provide quadratic advantage over classical algorithms for a diverse set of tasks, but are tricky to use without knowing beforehand what fraction $\lambda$ of the initial state is comprised of the target states. In contrast, fixed-point search algorithms need only a reliable lower bound on this fraction, but, as a consequence, lose the very quadratic advantage that makes Grover's algorithm so appealing. Here we provide the first version of amplitude amplification that achieves fixed-point behavior without sacrificing the quantum speedup. Our result incorporates an adjustable bound on the failure probability, and, for a given number of oracle queries, guarantees that this bound is satisfied over the broadest possible range of $\lambda$."
1548,1509.06591,2015,7,23,11,Detecting Consistency of Overlapping Quantum Marginals by Separability,Jianxin Chen;Zhengfeng Ji;Nengkun Yu;Bei Zeng,"The quantum marginal problem asks whether a set of given density matrices are consistent, i.e., whether they can be the reduced density matrices of a global quantum state. Not many non-trivial analytic necessary (or sufficient) conditions are known for the problem in general. We propose a method to detect consistency of overlapping quantum marginals by considering the separability of some derived states. Our method works well for the $k$-symmetric extension problem in general, and for the general overlapping marginal problems in some cases. Our work is, in some sense, the converse to the well-known $k$-symmetric extension criterion for separability."
1549,1309.0621,2013,9,12,11,Enhanced thermal stability of the toric code through coupling to a bosonic bath,Fabio L Pedrocchi;Adrian Hutter;James R Wootton;Daniel Loss,"We propose and study a model of a quantum memory that features self-correcting properties and a lifetime growing arbitrarily with system size at non-zero temperature. This is achieved by locally coupling a 2D L x L toric code to a 3D bath of bosons hopping on a cubic lattice. When the stabilizer operators of the toric code are coupled to the displacement operator of the bosons, we solve the model exactly via a polaron transformation and show that the energy penalty to create anyons grows linearly with L. When the stabilizer operators of the toric code are coupled to the bosonic density operator, we use perturbation theory to show that the energy penalty for anyons scales with ln(L). For a given error model, these energy penalties lead to a lifetime of the stored quantum information growing respectively exponentially and polynomially with L. Furthermore, we show how to choose an appropriate coupling scheme in order to hinder the hopping of anyons (and not only their creation) with energy barriers that are of the same order as the anyon creation gaps. We argue that a toric code coupled to a 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet realizes our model in its low-energy sector. Finally, we discuss the delicate issue of the stability of topological order in the presence of perturbations. While we do not derive a rigorous proof of topological order, we present heuristic arguments suggesting that topological order remains intact when perturbative operators acting on the toric code spins are coupled to the bosonic environment."
1550,1305.4910,2013,9,23,11,Model of quantum measurement and thermodynamical cost of accuracy and stability of information processing,Robert Alicki,"The quantum measurement problem is revisited and discussed in terms of a new solvable measurement model which basic ingredient is the quantum model of a controlled single-bit memory. The structure of this model involving strongly coupled spin and quantum harmonic oscillator allows to define stable pointer states as well-separated Gaussian states of the quantum oscillator and analyze the transition from quantum to classical regime. The relations between accuracy of measurement, stability of pointer states, effective temperature of joint thermal and quantum noise and minimal work needed to perform the bit-flip are derived. They differ from those based on the Landauer principle and are used to analyze thermodynamic efficiency of quantum Szilard engine and imply more realistic estimations of minimal amount of work needed to perform long computations."
1551,1612.07792,2016,9,4,11,"Reflection and time reversal symmetry enriched topological phases of matter: path integrals, non-orientable manifolds, and anomalies",Maissam Barkeshli;Parsa Bonderson;Chao-Ming Jian;Meng Cheng;Kevin Walker,"We study symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases in 2+1 space-time dimensions with spatial reflection and/or time-reversal symmetries. We provide a systematic construction of a wide class of reflection and time-reversal SET phases in terms of a topological path integral defined on general space-time manifolds. An important distinguishing feature of different topological phases with reflection and/or time-reversal symmetry is the value of the path integral on non-orientable space-time manifolds. We derive a simple general formula for the path integral on the manifold $\Sigma^2 \times S^1$, where $\Sigma^2$ is a two-dimensional non-orientable surface and $S^1$ is a circle. This also gives an expression for the ground state degeneracy of the SET on the surface $\Sigma^2$ that depends on the reflection symmetry fractionalization class, generalizing the Verlinde formula for ground state degeneracy on orientable surfaces. Consistency of the action of the mapping class group on non-orientable manifolds leads us to a constraint that can detect when a time-reversal or reflection SET phase is anomalous in (2+1)D and, thus, can only exist at the surface of a (3+1)D symmetry protected topological (SPT) state. Given a (2+1)D reflection and/or time-reversal SET phase, we further derive a general formula that determines which (3+1)D reflection and/or time-reversal SPT phase hosts the (2+1)D SET phase as its surface termination. A number of explicit examples are studied in detail."

These new quantum codes are derived from (classical) algebraic geometry (AG) codes by applying the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. Many of these codes have large minimum distances when compared with its code length and they have relatively small Singleton defect. For example, we construct a family [[46; 2(t_2 - t1); d]]_25 of quantum codes, where t_1, t_2 are positive integers such that 1 < t_1 < t_2 < 23 and d >= min 46 - 2t_2, 2t_1-2, of length n = 46, with minimum distance in the range 2 =< d =< 20, having Singleton defect four. Additionally, by utilizing t-point AG codes, with t >= 2, we show how to obtain sequences of asymptotically good quantum codes."

Here we provide new methods of training quantum Boltzmann machines, which are a class of recurrent quantum neural network. Our work generalizes existing methods and provides new approaches for training quantum neural networks that compare favorably to existing methods. We further demonstrate that quantum Boltzmann machines enable a form of quantum state tomography that not only estimates a state but provides a perscription for generating copies of the reconstructed state. Classical Boltzmann machines are incapable of this. Finally we compare small non-stoquastic quantum Boltzmann machines to traditional Boltzmann machines for generative tasks and observe evidence that quantum models outperform their classical counterparts."

We apply these bounds to graph-based models of local quantum spin systems to obtain speed limits on these tasks. Comparison with numerical optimal control results for spin chains suggests that unexplored regions of the dynamical landscape may support enhanced performance of key quantum information processing tasks.
1555,1612.02806,2016,12,16,11,Quantum autoencoders for efficient compression of quantum data,Jonathan Romero;Jonathan P Olson;Alán Aspuru-Guzik,"Classical autoencoders are neural networks that can learn efficient codings of large datasets. The task of an autoencoder is, given an input $x$, to simply reproduce $x$ at the output with the smallest possible error. For one class of autoencoders, the structure of the underlying network forces the autoencoder to represent the data on a smaller number of bits than the input length, effectively compressing the input. Inspired by this idea, we introduce the model of a quantum autoencoder to perform similar tasks on quantum data. The quantum autoencoder is trained to compress a particular dataset, where an otherwise efficient compression algorithm cannot be employed. The training of the quantum autoencoder is done using classical optimization algorithms. We show that efficient quantum autoencoders can be obtained using simple circuit heuristics. We apply our model to compress molecular wavefunctions with applications in quantum simulation of chemistry."

Our approach combines charged excitations carried by strings, with topological properties that arise from embedding the strings in the interior of a three dimensional manifold with boundary. A quon is a composite that acts as a particle. Specifically a quon is a hemispherical cap containing a neutral pair of open strings. We interpret multi-quons and their transformations in a natural way. We obtain a new type of relation, a string-genus ""joint relation,"" involving both a string and the 3D manifold. We use the joint relation to obtain a topological interpretation of the $C^{*}$ Hopf algebra relations, that are widely used in tensor networks. We obtain a 3D representation of the CNOT gate (that is considerably simpler than earlier work) and a 3D topological protocol for teleportation."

This method has been widely studied since it was first introduced by Jordan, Farhi, and Shor (JFS) in the context of adiabatic quantum computing. Here we extend the original result to general Markovian environments, not necessarily in Lindblad form. We show that the main conclusion of the original JFS study holds under these general circumstances: assuming a physically reasonable bath model, it is possible to suppress the initial decay out of the encoded ground state with an energy penalty strength that grows only logarithmically in the system size, at a fixed temperature."
1558,1612.01505,2016,12,9,11,The Adiabatic Theorem for Many-Body Quantum Systems,Sven Bachmann;Wojciech De Roeck;Martin Fraas,"The first proof of the quantum adiabatic theorem was given as early as 1928. Today, this theorem is increasingly applied in a many-body context, e.g. in quantum annealing and in studies of topological properties of matter. In this setup, the rate of variation $\varepsilon$ of local terms is indeed small compared to the gap, but the rate of variation of the total, extensive Hamiltonian, is not. Therefore, applications to many-body systems are not covered by the proofs and arguments in the literature. In this letter, we prove a version of the adiabatic theorem for gapped ground states of quantum spin systems, under assumptions that remain valid in the thermodynamic limit. As an application, we give a mathematical proof of Kubo linear response formula for a broad class of gapped interacting systems."
1559,1611.07651,2016,12,7,11,Hadamard quantum broadcast channels,Qingle Wang;Siddhartha Das;Mark M Wilde,"We consider three different communication tasks for quantum broadcast channels, and we determine the capacity region of a Hadamard broadcast channel for these various tasks. We define a Hadamard broadcast channel to be such that the channel from the sender to one of the receivers is entanglement-breaking and the channel from the sender to the other receiver is complementary to this one. As such, this channel is a quantum generalization of a degraded broadcast channel, which is well known in classical information theory. The first communication task we consider is classical communication to both receivers, the second is quantum communication to the stronger receiver and classical communication to other, and the third is entanglement-assisted classical communication to the stronger receiver and unassisted classical communication to the other. The structure of a Hadamard broadcast channel plays a critical role in our analysis: the channel to the weaker receiver can be simulated by performing a measurement channel on the stronger receiver's system, followed by a preparation channel. As such, we can incorporate the classical output of the measurement channel as an auxiliary variable and solve all three of the above capacities for Hadamard broadcast channels, in this way avoiding known difficulties associated with quantum auxiliary variables."
1560,1611.05841,2016,12,6,11,Living on the Edge: A Toy Model for Holographic Reconstruction of Algebras with Centers,William Donnelly;Ben Michel;Donald Marolf;Jason Wien,"We generalize the Pastawski-Yoshida-Harlow-Preskill (HaPPY) holographic quantum error-correcting code to provide a toy model for bulk gauge fields or linearized gravitons. The key new elements are the introduction of degrees of freedom on the links (edges) of the associated tensor network and their connection to further copies of the HaPPY code by an appropriate isometry. The result is a model in which boundary regions allow the reconstruction of bulk algebras with central elements living on the interior edges of the (greedy) entanglement wedge, and where these central elements can also be reconstructed from complementary boundary regions. In addition, the entropy of boundary regions receives both Ryu-Takayanagi-like contributions and further corrections that model the $\frac{\delta \text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term of Faulkner, Lewkowycz, and Maldacena. Comparison with Yang-Mills theory then suggests that this $\frac{\delta \text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term can be reinterpreted as a part of the bulk entropy of gravitons under an appropriate extension of the physical bulk Hilbert space."

For this reason, whenever one is interested only in some particular property of a state, it would be desirable to design a measurement setup that reveals this property with as little effort as possible. Here we investigate whether, in order to successfully complete a given task of this kind, one needs an informationally complete measurement, or if something less demanding would suffice. The first alternative means that in order to complete the task, one needs a measurement which fully determines the state. We formulate the task as a membership problem related to a partitioning of the quantum state space and, in doing so, connect it to the geometry of the state space. For a general membership problem we prove various sufficient criteria that force informational completeness, and we explicitly treat several physically relevant examples. For the specific cases that do not require informational completeness, we also determine bounds on the minimal number of measurement outcomes needed to ensure success in the task."

We propose and demonstrate a new quantum approach to make ground and excited-states experimentally accessible by introducing the concept of an ""eigenstate witness"", which has no direct analogue in classical algorithms. Combining favourable aspects of quantum variational methods and quantum phase estimation, this approach further enhances the accuracy in the eigenvalues calculation without additional costs. We experimentally verify this protocol on a programmable silicon quantum photonic chip, a mass-manufacturable platform, which embeds entangled state generation, arbitrary controlled-unitary operations and projective measurements. Both ground and excited-states are experimentally found with fidelities > 99%, and their eigenvalues are estimated with a 32-bits precision. Furthermore, we investigate the scalability of our approach by performing numerical simulations for more complex Hamiltonians. This result shows a new, promising tool for the implementation of quantum simulation on quantum computers."
1563,1611.03147,2016,11,15,11,The gap of the area-weighted Motzkin spin chain is exponentially small,Lionel Levine;Ramis Movassagh,"We prove that the energy gap of the model proposed by Zhang, Ahmadain, and Klich [1] is exponentially small in the square of the system size. In [2] a class of exactly solvable quantum spin chain models was proposed that have integer spins ($s$), with a nearest neighbors Hamiltonian, and a unique ground state. The ground state can be seen as a uniform superposition of all $s-$colored Motzkin walks. The half-chain entanglement entropy provably violates the area law by a square root factor in the system's size ($\sim\sqrt{n}$) for $s>1$. For $s=1$, the violation is logarithmic [3]. Moreover in [2] it was proved that the gap vanishes polynomially and is $O(n^{-c})$ with $c\ge2$. Recently, a deformation of [2], which we call ""weighted Motzkin quantum spin chain"" was proposed [1]. This model has a unique ground state that is a superposition of the $s-$colored Motzkin walks weighted by $t^{\text{area\{Motzkin walk\}}}$ with $t>1$. The most surprising feature of this model is that it violates the area law by a factor of $n$. Here we prove that the gap of this model is upper bounded by $8ns\text{ }t^{-n^{2}/3}$ for $t>1$."

This will essentially cover the background material with an introduction to basic concepts in anyon physics, fractional statistics, braid groups and abelian anyons. The next topic that we will study is a specific exactly solvable model, called the toric code model, whose excitations have (mutual) anyon statistics. Then we will go on to discuss non-abelian anyons, where we will use the one dimensional Kitaev model as a prototypical example to produce Majorana modes at the edge. We will then explicitly derive the non-abelian unitary matrices under exchange of these Majorana modes."

This is typically done through entanglement monotones or conversion witnesses. Such quantities cannot be computed for arbitrary quantum states in general, but it is useful to consider classes of symmetric states for which closed-form expressions can be found. In this paper, we show how to compute the convex roof of any entanglement monotone for all Werner states. The convex roofs of the well-known Vidal monotones are computed for all isotropic states, and we show how this method can generalize to other entanglement measures and other types of symmetries as well. We also present necessary and sufficient conditions that determine when a pure bipartite state can be deterministically converted into a Werner or isotropic state."
1566,1609.07044,2016,10,31,11,Adaptation of the Alicki-Fannes-Winter method for the set of states with bounded energy and its use,M E Shirokov,"We describe a modification of the Alicki-Fannes-Winter method (used for proving uniform continuity of functions on the set of quantum states). It allows to show uniform continuity on the set of states with bounded energy of any locally almost affine function having limited growth with increasing energy. Some applications in quantum information theory are considered. In particular, continuity bounds for the relative entropy of entanglement and for its regularization under the energy constraint on one subsystem are obtained. The uniform finite-dimensional approximation theorem for the Holevo capacity and for the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of energy constrained channels is proved."

Model selection can be used to tailor the number of fit parameters to the data, but quantum tomography violates some common assumptions that underly canonical model selection techniques based on ratios of maximum likelihoods (loglikelihood ratio statistics), due to the nature of the state space boundaries. Here, we study the behavior of the maximum likelihood in different Hilbert space dimensions, and derive an expression for a complexity penalty -- the expected value of the loglikelihood ratio statistic (roughly, the logarithm of the maximum likelihood) -- that can be used to make an appropriate choice for d."

In doing this it will be necessary to define clear achievable metrics to measure and compare the performance of real codes. Here we consider the smallest examples of several families of topological codes: surface codes, color codes, and the gauge color code, and determine the minimum requirements to demonstrate error suppression. We use an exact decoder to compare the performance of the codes under simple models of both physical error and measurement error, and determine regions of correctability in the physical parameters for each code."

The corresponding diagonal values are known as the symplectic spectrum. This paper is concerned with the stability of Williamson's decomposition under perturbations. We provide norm bounds for the stability of the symplectic eigenvalues and prove that if $S$ diagonalises a given matrix $M$ to Williamson form, then $S$ is stable if the symplectic spectrum is nondegenerate and $S^TS$ is always stable. Finally, we sketch a few applications of the results in quantum information theory."
1570,1609.01030,2016,9,15,11,Device-independent characterizations of the quantum state in a Bell experiment,Zhaohui Wei;Jamie Sikora,"In a Bell experiment two parties share a quantum state and perform local measurements on their subsystems separately, and the statistics of the measurement outcomes are recorded as a Bell correlation. For any Bell correlation, it turns out a quantum state with minimal size that is able to produce this correlation can always be pure. In this work, we first exhibit two characterizations for the pure state that Alice and Bob share using only the correlation data. Specifically, we give two conditions that the Schmidt coefficients must satisfy, which have very broad applications in many quantum tasks. First, one of the characterizations allows us to bound the entanglement between Alice and Bob using Renyi entropies and also to estimate the underlying Hilbert space dimension. Second, we provide examples to show that our results can be tight, where the shared quantum state is characterized completely. In this situation, our result serves as a general theoretical tool to self-test bipartite pure quantum states in a device-independent manner. Third, the second characterization gives a sufficient condition that a Bell correlation cannot be generated by maximally entangled states of certain dimension. We also show that our results can be generalized to the case of shared mixed states."
1571,1608.05764,2016,9,8,11,Optimally Stopped Optimization,Walter Vinci;Daniel A Lidar,"We combine the fields of heuristic optimization and optimal stopping. We propose a strategy for benchmarking randomized optimization algorithms that minimizes the expected total cost for obtaining a good solution with an optimal number of calls to the solver. To do so, rather than letting the objective function alone define a cost to be minimized, we introduce a further cost-per-call of the algorithm. We show that this problem can be formulated using optimal stopping theory. The expected cost is a flexible figure of merit for benchmarking probabilistic solvers that can be computed when the optimal solution is not known, and that avoids the biases and arbitrariness that affect other measures. The optimal stopping formulation of benchmarking directly leads to a real-time, optimal-utilization strategy for probabilistic optimizers with practical impact. We apply our formulation to benchmark simulated annealing on a class of MAX2SAT problems. We also compare the performance of a D-Wave 2X quantum annealer to the HFS solver, a specialized classical heuristic algorithm designed for low tree-width graphs. On a set of frustrated-loop instances with planted solutions defined on up to N = 1098 variables, the D-Wave device is two orders of magnitude faster than the HFS solver, and, modulo known caveats related to suboptimal annealing times, exhibits identical scaling with problem size."

We avoid the possibility for singularities by applying various cutoffs to the system and using a high-order finite difference approximation to the kinetic energy operator. We find that our algorithm can simulate $\eta$ interacting particles using a number of calculations of the pairwise interactions that scales, for a fixed spatial grid spacing, as $\tilde{O}(\eta^4)$, versus the $\tilde{O}(\eta^5)$ time required by previous methods (assuming the number of orbitals is proportional to $\eta$), and scales super-polynomially better with the error tolerance than algorithms based on the Lie-Trotter-Suzuki product formula. Finally, we analyze discretization errors that arise from the spatial grid and show that under some circumstances these errors can remove the exponential speedups typically afforded by quantum simulation."
1573,1608.04460,2016,9,6,11,Purity in microcanonical thermodynamics: a tale of three resource theories,Giulio Chiribella;Carlo Maria Scandolo,"Resource theories provide a framework for thermodynamics beyond the thermodynamic limit. For systems with definite energy,the key resource is purity. In this paper we formulate three alternative resource theories of purity in the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs). Each resource theory corresponds to a different choice of free operations, including i)random reversible operations, ii)noisy operations, generated by reversible interactions with ancillas in the microcanonical state, and iii)unital operations, which preserve the microcanonical state.We determine the requirements the underlying GPT must satisfy in order to support well-behaved resource theories with the above sets as free operations. Then, we focus on a special class of physical theories, called sharp theories with purification, which are appealing for an information-theoretic foundation of thermodynamics. For every sharp theory with purification we show that the convertibility of states implies the validity of a majorisation condition. Moreover, we characterise exactly when majorisation is sufficient for convertibility via random reversible operations. Under this condition, we prove that i) random reversible, noisy, and unital operations obey inclusion relations like in quantum theory, ii) despite being different, the three sets of operations are equivalent in terms of convertibility, iii) there exists a one-to-one correspondence between measures of purity and Schur-convex functions, and iv) purity resources are dual to entanglement resources."
1574,1608.04459,2016,8,23,11,Entanglement as an axiomatic foundation for statistical mechanics,Giulio Chiribella;Carlo Maria Scandolo,"We propose four information-theoretic axioms for the foundations of statistical mechanics in general physical theories. The axioms---Causality, Purity Preservation, Pure Sharpness, and Purification---identify a class of theories where every mixed state can be modelled as the marginal of a pure entangled state and where every unsharp measurement can be modelled as a sharp measurement on a composite system. This class of theories, called sharp theories with purification, includes quantum theory both with complex and real amplitudes, as well as a suitable extension of classical probability theory where classical systems can be entangled with other, non-classical systems. Theories satisfying our axioms support well-behaved notions of majorization, entropy, and Gibbs states, allowing for an information-theoretic derivation of Landauer's principle. We conjecture that every theory admitting a sensible thermodynamics must be extendable to a sharp theory with purification."

1576,1608.01920,2016,8,17,11,Why should we care about quantum discord?,Aharon Brodutch;Daniel R Terno,"Entanglement is a central feature of quantum theory. Mathematical properties and physical applications of pure state entanglement make it a template to study quantum correlations. However, an extension of entanglement measures to mixed states in terms of separability does not always correspond to all the operational aspects. Quantum discord measures allow an alternative way to extend the idea of quantum correlations to mixed states. In many cases these extensions are motivated by physical scenarios and quantum information protocols. In this chapter we discuss several settings involving correlated quantum systems, ranging from distributed gates to detectors testing quantum fields. In each setting we show how entanglement fails to capture the relevant features of the correlated system, and discuss the role of discord as a possible alternative."

The PEPS study is not only limited to global symmetries, but has also been extended and applied for local symmetries, allowing to use them for the description of states in lattice gauge theories. In this paper we discuss PEPS with a local, SU(2) gauge symmetry, and demonstrate the use of PEPS features and techniques for the study of a simple family of many body states with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. We present, in particular, the construction of fermionic PEPS able to describe both two-color fermionic matter and the degrees of freedom of an SU(2) gauge field with a suitable truncation."

We show that for a fixed computation time, the optimal evolution has a bang-bang (square pulse) form, both for closed and open quantum systems with Markovian decoherence. Our findings support the choice of evolution ansatz in the recently proposed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Focusing on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass as an example, we find a system-size independent distribution of the duration of pulses, with characteristic time scale set by the inverse of the coupling constants in the Hamiltonian. The optimality of the bang-bang protocols and the characteristic time scale of the pulses provide an efficient parameterization of the protocol and inform the search for effective hybrid (classical and quantum) schemes for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. As we numerically demonstrate, our optimal nonadiabatic bang-bang protocols can significantly outperform quantum annealing, favoring gate-model quantum computation for quantum enhanced optimization. Moreover, the bang-bang protocols exhibit robustness, yielding high-fidelity final states in the presence of weak white additive noise."

With the advent of device-independent quantum information processing, Bell inequalities have gained an additional role as certificates of relevant quantum properties. In this work we consider the problem of designing Bell inequalities that are tailored to detect the presence of maximally entangled states. We introduce a class of Bell inequalities valid for an arbitrary number of measurements and results, derive analytically their maximal violation and prove that it is attained by maximally entangled states. Our inequalities can therefore find an application in device-independent protocols requiring maximally entangled states."

Our optimization is based on an efficient and accurate evaluation of the gradient of the global energy functional by using effective corner environments, and is robust with respect to the initial starting points. It has the additional advantage that physical and virtual symmetries can be straightforwardly implemented. We provide the tools to compute static structure factors directly in momentum space, as well as the variance of the Hamiltonian. We benchmark our method on Ising and Heisenberg models, and show a significant improvement on the energies and order parameters as compared to algorithms based on imaginary-time evolution."
1581,1606.05532,2016,7,25,11,Surpassing the Carnot Efficiency by extracting imperfect work,Nelly Huei Ying Ng;Mischa P Woods;Stephanie Wehner,"A suitable way of quantifying work for microscopic quantum systems has been constantly debated in the field of quantum thermodynamics. One natural approach is to measure the average increase in energy of an ancillary system, called the battery, after a work extraction protocol. The quality of energy extracted is usually argued to be good by quantifying higher moments of the energy distribution, or by restricting the amount of entropy to be low. This limits the amount of heat contribution to the energy extracted, but does not completely prevent it. We show that the definition of ""work"" is crucial. If one allows for a definition of work that tolerates a non-negligible entropy increase in the battery, then a small scale heat engine can possibly exceed the Carnot efficiency. This can be achieved even when one of the heat baths is finite in size."
1582,1606.05283,2016,7,18,11,Entanglement and deterministic quantum computing with one qubit,Michel Boyer;Aharon Brodutch;Tal Mor,"The role of entanglement and quantum correlations in complex physical systems and quantum information processing devices has become a topic of intense study in the past two decades. While many results are known for physical systems that can be described using pure states, much less is known for the more general mixed state scenarios. The deterministic quantum computing with one qubit (DQC1) model is a non-universal model for quantum computing. The highly mixed nature of the states in this model make it a popular tool for studying the role of entanglement and correlations in mixed state quantum computing. In the past, the amounts of entanglement and/or discord produced in a particular instance of DQC1 were studied for special cases and typical instances. Here we present more tools for studying entanglement in this model. These tools provide us with new insights about the role of entanglement in DQC1. We show that results regarding typical instances are poor indicators of the role of entanglement generated in DQC1 complete problems. We further give a necessary and sufficient condition on the purity of the initial states that can produce entanglement in DQC1. The tools presented in this work may be useful for identifying (or ruling out) a subset of DQC1 circuits that can encode DQC1 complete problems without producing entanglement. They are also useful for studying other quantum systems where the states have a highly degenerate eigenvalue spectrum."

Notably, in this setup, certain entangled states admitting a local hidden variable model in the standard Bell scenario can nevertheless violate a Bell inequality after filtering, displaying so-called hidden nonlocality. Here we ask whether all entangled states can violate a Bell inequality after well-chosen local filtering. We answer this question in the negative by showing that there exist entangled states without hidden nonlocality. Specifically, we prove that some two-qubit Werner states still admit a local hidden variable model after any possible local filtering on a single copy of the state."

Quantum error correction and simulation often make a more exacting demand: the ability to perform non-destructive measurements of specific correlations within that system. We realize such measurements by employing a protocol adapted from [S. Nigg and S. M. Girvin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 243604 (2013)], enabling real-time selection of arbitrary register-wide Pauli operators. Our implementation consists of a simple circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) module of four highly-coherent 3D transmon qubits, collectively coupled to a high-Q superconducting microwave cavity. As a demonstration, we enact all seven nontrivial subset-parity measurements on our three-qubit register. For each we fully characterize the realized measurement by analyzing the detector (observable operators) via quantum detector tomography and by analyzing the quantum back-action via conditioned process tomography. No single quantity completely encapsulates the performance of a measurement, and standard figures of merit have not yet emerged. Accordingly, we consider several new fidelity measures for both the detector and the complete measurement process. We measure all of these quantities and report high fidelities, indicating that we are measuring the desired quantities precisely and that the measurements are highly non-demolition. We further show that both results are improved significantly by an additional error-heralding measurement. The analyses presented here form a useful basis for the future characterization and validation of quantum measurements, anticipating the demands of emerging quantum technologies."

This assumption is crucial to prove the quantum Cramér-Rao theorem and to introduce the quantum Fisher information as an upper bound to the Fisher information of any possible measurement. However, there are relevant estimation problems where this assumption does not hold and an alternative approach should be developed to find the genuine ultimate bound to precision of quantum measurements. We investigate physical situations where there is an intrinsic dependence of the measurement strategy on the parameter and find that quantum-enhanced measurements may be more precise than previously thought."

However, there are subtle errors in the original proof. In this paper, we point out the issues, and rescue these two separations by using more sophisticated constructions. Meanwhile, we take the opportunity to study the complexity classes $\mathsf{BPP_{path}}$ and $\textsf{SZK}$. We give general ways to construct functions which are hard for $\textsf{SZK}$ and $\mathsf{BPP_{path}}$ (in the query complexity sense). Using these techniques, we give alternative construction for the oracle separation $\textsf{BQP} \not\subset \textsf{SZK}$, using only Simon's problem. We also give new oracle separations for $\textsf{P}^{\textsf{SZK}}$ from $\mathsf{BPP_{path}}$ and $\textsf{P}^{\textsf{SZK}}$ from $\textsf{QSK}$. The latter result suggests that $\textsf{P}^{\textsf{SZK}}$ might be strictly larger than $\textsf{SZK}$."

Quantum channels represent all possible evolutions of states allowed by quantum mechanics while correlations are intrinsic (nonlocal) properties of composite systems. There are four main problems that are addressed (i) the role played by initial system-bath correlations on the subsystem dynamics of an open quantum system, (ii) computation of correlations for two-qubit X-states, (iii) the robustness of non-Gaussian entanglement under symmetric local noisy attenuator and amplifier channels, and finally, (iv) the connection between nonclassicality breaking and entanglement breaking for single-mode bosonic Gaussian channels."

Some of these processes produce correlations incompatible with any causal order (they violate so-called ""causal inequalities"" analogous to Bell inequalities) while others do not (they admit a ""causal model"" analogous to a local model). Here we show for the first time that bipartite causally nonseparable processes with a causal model exist, and give evidence that they have no clear physical interpretation. We also provide an algorithm to generate processes of this kind and show that they have nonzero measure in the set of all processes. We demonstrate the existence of processes which stop violating causal inequalities but are still causally nonseparable when mixed with a certain amount of ""white noise"". This is reminiscent of the behavior of Werner states in the context of entanglement and nonlocality. Finally, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of causally nonseparable processes which have a causal model even when extended with an entangled state shared among the parties."

This shows that quantum equilibration is a fundamental, nigh unavoidable, aspect of physical systems, while classical equilibration relies on experimental ignorance. When the state is not completely known, a mixed state, this framework also shows quantum equilibration requires weaker conditions."

However it requires that the original global state be uniquely determined (UD) by its local reduced density matrices (RDMs). In this work we demonstrate for the first time a class of states that are UD by their RDMs under the assumption that the global state is pure, but fail to be UD in the absence of that assumption. This discovery allows us to classify quantum states according to their UD properties, with the requirement that each class be treated distinctly in the practice of simplifying quantum state tomography. Additionally we experimentally test the feasibility and stability of performing quantum state tomography via the measurement of local RDMs for each class. These theoretical and experimental results advance the project of performing efficient and accurate quantum state tomography in practice."

However, there remain questions regarding the degree of confidence that can be placed in the results of AQS since they do not naturally incorporate error correction. Specifically, how do we know whether an analog simulation of a quantum model will produce predictions that agree with the ideal model in the presence of inevitable imperfections? At the same time there is a widely held expectation that certain quantum simulation questions will be robust to errors and perturbations in the underlying hardware. Resolving these two points of view is a critical step in making the most of this promising technology. In this work we formalize the notion of AQS reliability by determining sensitivity of AQS outputs to underlying parameters, and formulate conditions for robust simulation. Our approach naturally reveals the importance of model symmetries in dictating the robust properties of a quantum simulation. To demonstrate the approach, we present analytical and numerical results that characterize the robust features of several quantum many-body models, including the transverse field Ising model and the Fermi-Hubbard model."

While the salient features of a quantum computer have been shown in proof-of-principle experiments, difficulties in scaling quantum systems have made more complex operations intractable. This is exemplified in the classical Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate for which, despite theoretical proposals, no quantum analogue has been realised. By adding control to the SWAP unitary, we use photonic qubit logic to demonstrate the first quantum Fredkin gate, which promises many applications in quantum information and measurement. We implement example algorithms and generate the highest-fidelity three-photon GHZ states to-date. The technique we use allows one to add a control operation to a black-box unitary, something impossible in the standard circuit model. Our experiment represents the first use of this technique to control a two-qubit operation and paves the way for larger controlled circuits to be realised efficiently."

This work is calculated without regard for the size of its fluctuations. We find that in some processes, such as reversible cooling, the fluctuations of the work can diverge. Small or fragile thermal machines may be unable to cope with large fluctuations. Hence, with the present focus on nano- scale thermodynamics, we analyse how thermodynamic efficiency rates are modified when the size of the fluctuations around the average is restricted. We quantify the work content and work of formation of any state when the work fluctuations are bounded by a given amount c. By varying c we interpolate between the standard free energy c = infinity and the min-free energy c = 0, defined in the context of single-shot thermodynamics. We derive fundamental relations between average work and its fluctuations, and explore the emergence of irreversibility and partial order on state transformations when bounding fluctuations. We also study the efficiency a single qubit thermal engine model with constrained fluctuations, and derive the corrections to the Carnot efficiency."

Many parameters need to be optimized to achieve high-fidelity operations. This can be done efficiently for operations acting on single qubits as errors can be fully characterized. For multi-qubit operations, though, this is no longer the case as in the most general case analyzing the effect of the operation on the system requires a full state tomography for which resources scale exponentially with the system size. Furthermore, in recent experiments additional electronic levels beyond the two-level system encoding the qubit have been used to enhance the capabilities of quantum information processors, which additionally increases the number of parameters that need to be controlled. For the optimization of the experimental system for a given task (e.g.~a quantum algorithm), one has to find a satisfactory error model and also efficient observables to estimate the parameters of the model. In this manuscript we demonstrate a method to optimize the encoding procedure for a small quantum error correction code in the presence of unknown but constant phase shifts. The method, which we implement here on a small-scale linear ion-trap quantum computer, is readily applicable to other AMO platforms for quantum information processing."

For this reason approaches to extend quantum coherence in the presence of noise are actively being explored. Here we experimentally protect a room-temperature hybrid spin register against environmental decoherence by performing repeated quantum error correction whilst maintaining sensitivity to signal fields. We use a long-lived nuclear spin to correct multiple phase errors on a sensitive electron spin in diamond and realize magnetic field sensing beyond the timescales set by natural decoherence. The universal extension of sensing time, robust to noise at any frequency, demonstrates the definitive advantage entangled multi-qubit systems provide for quantum sensing and offers an important complement to quantum control techniques. In particular, our work opens the door for detecting minute signals in the presence of high frequency noise, where standard protocols reach their limits."

First, we prove that random pure states drawn from the Hilbert space of distinguishable particles typically do not lead to super-classical scaling of precision even when allowing for local unitary optimization. Conversely, we show that random states from the symmetric subspace typically achieve the optimal Heisenberg scaling without the need for local unitary optimization. Surprisingly, the Heisenberg scaling is observed for states of arbitrarily low purity and preserved under finite particle losses. Moreover, we prove that for such states a standard photon-counting interferometric measurement suffices to typically achieve the Heisenberg scaling of precision for all possible values of the phase at the same time. Finally, we demonstrate that metrologically useful states can be prepared with short random optical circuits generated from three types of beam-splitters and a non-linear (Kerr-like) transformation."
1597,1602.03251,2016,3,2,11,Exponential suppression of decoherence and relaxation of quantum systems using energy penalty,Iman Marvian,"One of the main methods for protecting quantum information against decoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy sector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from environment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate ground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the interaction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary number of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are local and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite number of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with respect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by a factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the norm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still evolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the context of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside the code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The result is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or their assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also prove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far from the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our main technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at high frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded and local interactions in a neighborhood around the support of the observable."

What is more, recent seminal experimental developments with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices constituting analog quantum simulators have pushed many-body localised systems into the realm of physical systems that can be measured with high accuracy. In this work, we introduce experimentally accessible witnesses that directly probe distinct features of MBL, distinguishing it from its Anderson counterpart. We insist on building our toolbox from techniques available in the laboratory, including on-site addressing, super-lattices, and time-of-flight measurements, identifying witnesses based on fluctuations, density-density correlators, densities, and entanglement. We build upon the theory of out of equilibrium quantum systems, in conjunction with tensor network and exact simulations, showing the effectiveness of the tools for realistic models."
1599,1512.05839,2015,2,18,11,Quantum superreplication of states and gates,Giulio Chiribella;Yuxiang Yang,"While the no-cloning theorem forbids the perfect replication of quantum information, it is sometimes possible to produce large numbers of replicas with vanishingly small error. This phenomenon, known as quantum superreplication, can take place both for quantum states and quantum gates. The aim of this paper is to review the central features of quantum superreplication, providing a unified view on the existing results. The paper also includes new results. In particular, we show that, when quantum superreplication can be achieved, it can be achieved through estimation, up to an error vanishing with a power law. Quantum strategies still offer an advantage for superreplication, in that they allow for an exponentially faster reduction of the error. Using the relation with estimation, we provide i) an alternative proof of the optimality of the Heisenberg scaling of quantum metrology, ii) a strategy to estimate arbitrary unitary gates with Heisenberg scaling, up to a logarithmic overhead, and iii) a protocol that generates M nearly perfect copies of a generic pure state with a number of queries to the corresponding unitary gate scaling as the square root of M. Finally, we point out that superreplication can be achieved using interactions among k systems, provided that k is large compared to square of the ratio between the numbers of input and output copies."

However, not all entangled quantum states display nonlocality, and a central question is to determine the precise relation between entanglement and nonlocality. Here we present the first general test to decide whether a quantum state is local, and that can be implemented by semidefinite programming. This method can be applied to any given state and for the construction of new examples of states with local hidden-variable models for both projective and general measurements. As applications we provide a lower bound estimate of the fraction of two-qubit local entangled states and present new explicit examples of such states, including those which arise from physical noise models, Bell-diagonal states, and noisy GHZ and W states."

We investigate the general constructions of $k$-uniform pure quantum states of $n$ subsystems with $d$ levels. We provide one construction via symmetric matrices and the second one through classical error-correcting codes. There are three main results arising from our constructions. Firstly, we show that for any given even $n\ge 2$, there always exists an $n/2$-uniform $n$-qudit quantum state of level $p$ for sufficiently large prime $p$. Secondly, both constructions show that their exist $k$-uniform $n$-qudit pure quantum states such that $k$ is proportional to $n$, i.e., $k=\Omega(n)$ although the construction from symmetric matrices outperforms the one by error-correcting codes. Thirdly, our symmetric matrix construction provides a positive answer to the open question in \citeDA on whether there exists $3$-uniform $n$-qudit pure quantum state for all $n\ge 8$. In fact, we can further prove that, for every $k$, there exists a constant $M_k$ such that there exists a $k$-uniform $n$-qudit quantum state for all $n\ge M_k$. In addition, by using concatenation of algebraic geometry codes, we give an explicit construction of $k$-uniform quantum state when $k$ tends to infinity."

In contrast to Majorana fermions, braiding of parafermions with $d>2$ allows to perform an entangling gate. This has spurred interest in parafermions and a variety of condensed matter systems have been proposed as potential hosts for them. In this work, we study the computational power of braiding parafermions more systematically. We make no assumptions on the underlying physical model but derive all our results from the algebraical relations that define parafermions. We find a familiy of $2d$ representations of the braid group that are compatible with these relations. The braiding operators derived this way reproduce those derived previously from physical grounds as special cases. We show that if a $d$-level qudit is encoded in the fusion space of four parafermions, braiding of these four parafermions allows to generate the entire single-qudit Clifford group (up to phases), for any $d$. If $d$ is odd, then we show that in fact the entire many-qudit Clifford group can be generated."

One such primitive is the one-time memory (OTM), introduced by Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum [CRYPTO 2008], which is a classical functionality modeled after a non-interactive 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, and which is complete for one-time classical and quantum programs. It is known that secure OTMs do not exist in the standard model in both the classical and quantum settings. Here, we show how to use quantum information, together with the assumption of stateless (i.e., reusable) hardware tokens, to build statistically secure OTMs. This is in sharp contrast with the classical case, where stateless hardware tokens alone cannot yield OTMs. In addition, our scheme is technologically simple. We prove security in the quantum universal composability framework, employing semi-definite programming results of Molina, Vidick and Watrous [TQC 2013] and combinatorial techniques of Pastawski et al.

A wide variety of non-classical forms of correlation exist: amongst the best known are entanglement and discord. Quantum correlations can be used to enhance measurement accuracy and energy transport. This paper shows that quantum correlations -- in the form of discord -- are mandatory for any energy transport. Without discord, energy transport cannot occur. Moreover, we show that the initial rate of heat transfer between two systems prepared at different temperatures is directly proportional to the rate of increase in diagonal/energetic discord between the systems. We measured the increase of energetic discord induced by nanoscale heat flow across an aluminum-sapphire interface. The rate of increase of discord is measured to be 4.28*10^24 bits m^-2 K^-1 s^-1."

We show that the tensor network renormalization (TNR) algorithm [\emphG. Evenbly and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 180405] can be used to implement local scale transformations on these objects, namely a lattice version of conformal maps. Specifically, we explain how to implement the lattice equivalent of the logarithmic conformal map that transforms the Euclidean plane into a cylinder. As an application, and with the 2D critical Ising model as a concrete example, we use this map to build a lattice version of the scaling operators of the underlying conformal field theory, from which one can extract their scaling dimensions and operator product expansion coefficients."

Specifically we look at symmetric cost functions defined over n bits with a single potential barrier that a successful optimization algorithm will have to tunnel through. The height and width of this barrier depend on n, and by tuning these dependencies, we can make the optimization algorithm succeed or fail in polynomial time. In this article we compare the strength of quantum adiabatic tunneling with that of path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods. We find numerical evidence that quantum Monte Carlo algorithms will succeed in the same regimes where quantum adiabatic optimization succeeds."

In this paper, we propose long-range mutual information(LRMI) as a unified diagnostic for both conventional long-range order and topological order. Using the LRMI, we characterize orders in $n+1$D gapped systems as $m$-membrane condensates with $ 0 \leq m \leq n-1$. The familiar conventional order and 2+1D topological orders are respectively identified as $0$-membrane and $1$-membrane condensates.

Our dihedral benchmarking protocol is a generalization of randomized benchmarking that relaxes the usual unitary 2-design condition. Combining this protocol with existing randomized benchmarking schemes enables an efficient means of characterizing universal gate sets for quantum information processing in a way that is independent of state-preparation and measurement errors. In particular, our protocol enables direct benchmarking of the $T$ gate (sometime called $\pi/8$-gate) even for the gate-dependent error model that is expected in leading approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation."

These are a generalization of projective 2-designs which includes full sets of arbitrary rank mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) and arbitrary rank symmetric informationally complete measurements (SIMs), as well as the more familiar MUBs and SICs. We show that a POVM is a conical 2-design if and only if there exists what we call a regular entanglement monotone whose restriction to the pure states is a function of the norm of the probability vector. In that case the concurrence is such a monotone. We also generalize and develop previous work on designs and entanglement detection."

Conditions for a measurement to be MPE were derived by Yuen, Kennedy and Lax (YKL). MPE measurements have been found for states that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a transitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed geometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good measurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability of error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set involves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general. Our first contribution is a formula for the MPE and conditional probabilities of GU sets, using group representation theory. Next, we consider sets of pure states that have multiple orbits under the group action. Such states are termed compound geometrically uniform (CGU). MPE measurements for general CGU sets are not known. In this paper, we show how our representation-theoretic description of optimal measurements for GU sets naturally generalizes to the CGU case. We show how to compute the MPE measurement for CGU sets by reducing the problem to solving a few simultaneous equations. The number of equations depends on the sizes of the multiplicity space of irreducible representations. For many common group representations (such as those of several practical good linear codes), this is much more tractable than solving large semi-definite programs---which is what is needed to solve the YKL conditions numerically for arbitrary state sets. We show how to evaluate MPE measurements for CGU states for some examples relevant to quantum-limited classical optical communication."

We focus on one-dimensional realizations of the Majorana code, as well as networks of such structures, and investigate their lifetime when coupled to a parity-preserving thermal environment. We apply the Davies prescription, a standard method that describes the basic aspects of a thermal environment, and derive a master equation in the Born-Markov limit. We first focus on a single wire with immobile MBSs and perform error correction to annihilate thermal excitations. In the high-temperature limit, we show both analytically and numerically that the lifetime of the Majorana qubit grows logarithmically with the size of the wire. We then study a trijunction with four MBSs when braiding is executed. We study the occurrence of dangerous error processes that prevent the lifetime of the Majorana code from growing with the size of the trijunction. The origin of the dangerous processes is the braiding itself, which separates pairs of excitations and renders the noise nonlocal; these processes arise from the basic constraints of moving MBSs in 1D structures. We confirm our predictions with Monte Carlo simulations in the low-temperature regime, i.e. the regime of practical relevance. Our results put a restriction on the degree of self-correction of this particular 1D topological quantum computing architecture."

We consider the case where both the sender's inputs to the channel and the channel states are to be taken from a finite set (cq-channel with state information at the sender). We distinguish between causal and non-causal channel state information at the sender. The receiver remains ignorant, throughout. We give a single-letter description of the capacity in the first case. In the second case we present two different regularized expressions for the capacity. It is an astonishing and unexpected result of our work that a simple change from causal to non-causal channel state information at the encoder causes the complexity of a numerical computation of the capacity formula to change from trivial to seemingly difficult. Still, even the non-single letter formula allows one to draw nontrivial conclusions, for example regarding continuity of the capacity with respect to changes in the system parameters. The direct parts of both coding theorems are based on a special class of POVMs which are derived from orthogonal projections onto certain representations of the symmetric groups. This approach supports a reasoning that is inspired by the classical method of types. In combination with the non-commutative union bound these POVMs yield an elegant method of proof for the direct part of the coding theorem in the first case."

The symmetry of MUB is an elusive and interesting subject. A (complete set of) MUB in dimension $d$ is sharply covariant if it can be generated by a group of order $d(d+1)$ from a basis state. Such MUB, if they exist, would be most appealing to theoretical studies and practical applications. Unfortunately, they seem to be quite rare. Here we prove that no MUB in odd prime dimensions is sharply covariant, by virtue of clever applications of Mersenne primes, Galois fields, and Frobenius groups. This conclusion provides valuable insight about the symmetry of MUB and the geometry of quantum state space. It complements and strengthens the earlier result of the author that only two stabilizer MUB are sharply covariant. Our study leads to the conjecture that no MUB other than those in dimensions 2 and 4 is sharply covariant."

Indeed, quantum key distribution illustrates the power of encoding information on the quantum properties of light and has far reaching implications in high-security applications. Today, quantum key distribution systems operate in real-world conditions and are commercially available. As with most quantum information protocols, quantum key distribution was first designed for qubits, the individual quanta of information. However, the use of quantum continuous variables for this task presents important advantages with respect to qubit based protocols, in particular from a practical point of view, since it allows for simple implementations that require only standard telecommunication technology. In this review article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key distribution, focusing in particular on protocols based on coherent states. We discuss the security of these protocols and report on the state-of-the-art in experimental implementations, including the issue of side-channel attacks. We conclude with promising perspectives in this research field."

First, we prove the following general result: for every non-local XOR game, there exists a set of relations with the properties: (1) a quantum strategy is optimal for the game if and only if it satisfies the relations, and (2) a quantum strategy is nearly optimal for the game if and only if it approximately satisfies the relations. Next, we focus attention on a specific infinite family of XOR games: the CHSH(n) games. This family generalizes the well-known CHSH game. We describe the general form of CHSH(n) optimal strategies. Then, we adapt the concept of intertwining operator from representation theory and use that to characterize nearly-optimal CHSH(n) strategies."

These results hold in the presence of initial correlations between the system and the reservoir, under the sole assumption that their interaction and its commutator with the reservoir Hamiltonian are norm-bounded. The reservoir need not be thermal and can be time-dependent. We study the significance of energy mismatch between the system and the local degrees of freedom of the reservoir which directly interact with the system. We demonstrate that, in general, by increasing the system gap we may reduce this energy mismatch, and consequently drive the system and the reservoir into resonance, which can accelerate fidelity loss, irrespective of the thermal properties or state of the reservoir. This implies that quantum error suppression strategies based on increasing the gap are not uniformly beneficial. Our speed limits also yield an elementary lower bound on the relaxation time of spin systems."

Next, rather than starting from some local Hamiltonian with random potentials, we consider fluctuations of the local tensors of a continuous one-parameter family of Matrix Product States. This leads to a mapping from 1+1+0 to 0+1+1, being time-space-$\lambda$. We argue that both pictures are equivalent. Finally, the holography principle and an operational argumentation is used to map the problem onto 1+0+1. Localization in 1-dimension, can be understood from a simple study spectral and mixing properties of finite dimensional quantum channels."

More specific to quantum mechanics is the connection between entanglement and thermodynamics, which leads to an identification between entropies and measures of pure state entanglement. Here we search for the roots of this connection, investigating the relation between entanglement and thermodynamics in the framework of general probabilistic theories. We first address the question whether an entangled state can be transformed into another by means of local operations and classical communication. Under two operational requirements, we prove a general version of the Lo-Popescu theorem, which lies at the foundations of the theory of pure-state entanglement. We then consider a resource theory of purity where free operations are random reversible transformations, modelling the scenario where an agent has limited control over the dynamics of a closed system. Our key result is a duality between the resource theory of entanglement and the resource theory of purity, valid for every physical theory where all processes arise from pure states and reversible interactions at the fundamental level. As an application of the main result, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between entropies and measures of pure bipartite entanglement and exploit it to define entanglement measures in the general probabilistic framework. In addition, we show a duality between the task of information erasure and the task of entanglement generation, whereby the existence of entropy sinks (systems that can absorb arbitrary amounts of information) becomes equivalent to the existence of entanglement sources (correlated systems from which arbitrary amounts of entanglement can be extracted)."

One approach is to use block codes that encode multiple qubits, which can achieve significantly higher rates for the same code distance than single-qubit code blocks or topological codes. We present a scheme for universal quantum computation using multi-qubit Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) block codes, where codes admitting different transversal gates are used to achieve universality, and logical teleportation is used to move qubits between code blocks. All circuits for both computation and error correction are transversal. We also argue that single shot fault-tolerant error correction can be done in Steane syndrome extraction. Then, we present estimates of information lifetime for a few possible codes, which suggests that highly nontrivial quantum computations can be achieved at reasonable error rates, using codes that require significantly less than 100 physical qubits per logical qubit."

The field has recently seen a lot of progress, and the present focus issue offers a glimpse of these developments, showing both experimental and theoretical results from many of the leading groups around the world. On the experimental side, it shows work on cold gases, warm vapors, rare-earth ion doped crystals and single atoms. On the theoretical side there are in-depth studies of existing memory protocols, proposals for new protocols including approaches based on quantum error correction, and proposals for new applications of quantum storage. Looking forward, we anticipate many more exciting results in this area."

We propose a concrete physical realization by utilizing quantum phase slips in an array of Josephson-coupled mesoscopic topological superconductors, which can be implemented in a wide range of solid state systems, including topological insulators, nanowires or two-dimensional electron gases, proximitized by $s$-wave superconductors. Our model finds a natural application as a Majorana fermion surface code for universal quantum computation, with a single-step stabilizer measurement requiring no physical ancilla qubits, increased error tolerance, and simpler logical gates than a surface code with bosonic physical qubits. We thoroughly discuss protocols for stabilizer measurements, encoding and manipulating logical qubits, and gate implementations."

Josephson energy of the transmon-like device (""gatemon"") is controlled by an electrostatic gate that depletes carriers in a semiconducting weak link region. Strong coupling to an on-chip microwave cavity and coherent qubit control via gate voltage pulses is demonstrated, yielding reasonably long relaxation times (0.8 \mus) and dephasing times (1 \mus), exceeding gate operation times by two orders of magnitude, in these first-generation devices. Because qubit control relies on voltages rather than fluxes, dissipation in resistive control lines is reduced, screening reduces crosstalk, and the absence of flux control allows operation in a magnetic field, relevant for topological quantum information."

In this protocol, each signal pulse is accompanied by a reference pulse (or a pair of twin reference pulses), used to align Alice's and Bob's measurement bases. The method of phase estimation and compensation based on the reference pulse measurement can be viewed as a quantum analog of intradyne detection used in classical coherent communication, which extracts the phase information from the modulated signal. We present a proof-of-principle, fiber-based experimental demonstration of the protocol and quantify the expected secret key rates by expressing them in terms of experimental parameters. Our analysis of the secret key rate fully takes into account the inherent uncertainty associated with the quantum nature of the reference pulse(s) and quantifies the limit at which the theoretical key rate approaches that of the respective conventional protocol that requires local oscillator transmission. The self-referenced protocol greatly simplifies the hardware required for CV-QKD, especially for potential integrated photonics implementations of transmitters and receivers, with minimum sacrifice of performance. As such, it provides a pathway towards scalable integrated CV-QKD transceivers, a vital step towards large-scale QKD networks."

Recently, it has been studied whether generic quantum features such as coherence and quantum entanglement could allow for quantum devices with efficiencies larger than the Carnot efficiency. The present study shows that this is not permitted by the laws of thermodynamics. In particular, we will show that rather the definition of heat has to be modified to account for the thermodynamic cost for maintaining coherence and entanglement. Our theoretical findings are numerically illustrated for an experimentally relevant example from optomechanics."

Similar to classical codes, hashing bound approaching QECCs may be designed by exploiting a concatenated code structure, which invokes iterative decoding. Therefore, in this paper we provide an extensive step-by-step tutorial for designing EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart aided concatenated quantum codes based on the underlying quantum-to-classical isomorphism. These design lessons are then exemplified in the context of our proposed Quantum Irregular Convolutional Code (QIRCC), which constitutes the outer component of a concatenated quantum code. The proposed QIRCC can be dynamically adapted to match any given inner code using EXIT charts, hence achieving a performance close to the hashing bound. It is demonstrated that our QIRCC-based optimized design is capable of operating within 0.4 dB of the noise limit."
1631,1503.01334,2015,3,17,11,Sequential quantum mixing for slowly evolving sequences of Markov chains,Vedran Dunjko;Hans J Briegel,"In this work we consider the problem of preparation of the stationary distribution of irreducible, time-reversible Markov chains, which is a fundamental task in algorithmic Markov chain theory. For the classical setting, this task has a complexity lower bound of $\Omega(1/\delta)$, where $\delta$ is the spectral gap of the Markov chain, and other dependencies contribute only logarithmically. In the quantum case, the conjectured complexity is $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}})$ (with other dependencies contributing only logarithmically). However, this bound has only been achieved for a few special classes of Markov chains. In this work, we provide a method for the sequential preparation of stationary distributions for sequences of general time-reversible $N-$state Markov chains, akin to the setting of simulated annealing methods. The complexity of preparation we achieve is $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} N^{1/4})$, neglecting logarithmic factors. While this result falls short of the conjectured optimal time, it still provides at least a quadratic improvement over other straightforward approaches for quantum mixing applied in this setting."
1632,1502.04430,2015,3,12,11,Distributions Attaining Secret Key at a Rate of the Conditional Mutual Information,Eric Chitambar;Ben Fortescue;Min-Hsiu Hsieh,"In this paper we consider the problem of extracting secret key from an eavesdropped source $p_{XYZ}$ at a rate given by the conditional mutual information. We investigate this question under three different scenarios: (i) Alice ($X$) and Bob ($Y$) are unable to communicate but share common randomness with the eavesdropper Eve ($Z$), (ii) Alice and Bob are allowed one-way public communication, and (iii) Alice and Bob are allowed two-way public communication. Distributions having a key rate of the conditional mutual information are precisely those in which a ""helping"" Eve offers Alice and Bob no greater advantage for obtaining secret key than a fully adversarial one. For each of the above scenarios, strong necessary conditions are derived on the structure of distributions attaining a secret key rate of $I(X:Y|Z)$. In obtaining our results, we completely solve the problem of secret key distillation under scenario (i) and identify $H(S|Z)$ to be the optimal key rate using shared randomness, where $S$ is the Gács-Körner Common Information. We thus provide an operational interpretation of the conditional Gács-Körner Common Information. Additionally, we introduce simple example distributions in which the rate $I(X:Y|Z)$ is achievable if and only if two-way communication is allowed."
1633,1502.02673,2015,3,10,11,Coherence and measurement in quantum thermodynamics,Philipp Kammerlander;Janet Anders,"Thermodynamics is a highly successful macroscopic theory widely used across the natural sciences and for the construction of everyday devices, from car engines and fridges to power plants and solar cells. With thermodynamics predating quantum theory, research now aims to uncover the thermodynamic laws that govern finite size systems which may in addition host quantum effects. Here we identify information processing tasks, the so-called ""projections"", that can only be formulated within the framework of quantum mechanics. We show that the physical realisation of such projections can come with a non-trivial thermodynamic work only for quantum states with coherences. This contrasts with information erasure, first investigated by Landauer, for which a thermodynamic work cost applies for classical and quantum erasure alike. Implications are far-reaching, adding a thermodynamic dimension to measurements performed in quantum thermodynamics experiments, and providing key input for the construction of a future quantum thermodynamic framework. Repercussions are discussed for quantum work fluctuation relations and thermodynamic single-shot approaches."
1634,1501.04932,2015,3,5,11,Bounding quantum gate error rate based on reported average fidelity,Yuval R Sanders;Joel J Wallman;Barry C Sanders,"Remarkable experimental advances in quantum computing are exemplified by recent announcements of impressive average gate fidelities exceeding 99.9% for single-qubit gates and 99% for two-qubit gates. Although these high numbers engender optimism that fault-tolerant quantum computing is within reach, the connection of average gate fidelity with fault-tolerance requirements is not direct. Here we use reported average gate fidelity to determine an upper bound on the quantum-gate error rate, which is the appropriate metric for assessing progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation, and we demonstrate that this bound is asymptotically tight for general noise. Although this bound is unlikely to be saturated by experimental noise, we demonstrate using explicit examples that the bound indicates a realistic deviation between the true error rate and the reported average fidelity. We introduce the Pauli distance as a measure of this deviation, and we show that knowledge of the Pauli distance enables tighter estimates of the error rate of quantum gates."

In this work, however, we focus on investigating the information-theoretic upper bounds of sample complexity - how many training samples are sufficient to predict the future behaviour of an unknown target function. This kind of problem is, arguably, one of the most fundamental problems in statistical learning theory and the bounds for practical settings can be completely characterised by a simple measure of complexity. Our main result in the paper is that, for learning an unknown quantum measurement, the upper bound, given by the fat-shattering dimension, is linearly proportional to the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space. Learning an unknown quantum state becomes a dual problem to ours, and as a byproduct, we can recover Aaronson's famous result [Proc. R. Soc. A 463:3089-3144 (2007)] solely using a classical machine learning technique. In addition, other famous complexity measures like covering numbers and Rademacher complexities are derived explicitly. We are able to connect measures of sample complexity with various areas in quantum information science, e.g. quantum state/measurement tomography, quantum state discrimination and quantum random access codes, which may be of independent interest. Lastly, with the assistance of general Bloch-sphere representation, we show that learning quantum measurements/states can be mathematically formulated as a neural network. Consequently, classical ML algorithms can be applied to efficiently accomplish the two quantum learning tasks."
1637,1412.6111,2014,1,21,11,Quantum computation speedup limits from quantum metrological precision bounds,Rafal Demkowicz-Dobrzanski;Marcin Markiewicz,"We propose a scheme for translating metrological precision bounds into lower bounds on query complexity of quantum search algorithms. Within the scheme the link between quadratic performance enhancement in idealized quantum metrological and quantum computing schemes becomes clear. More importantly, we utilize results from the field of quantum metrology on a generic loss of quadratic quantum precision enhancement in presence of decoherence to infer an analogous generic loss of quadratic speed-up in oracle based quantum computing. While most of our reasoning is rigorous, at one of the final steps, we need to make use of an unproven technical conjecture. We hope that we will be able to amend this deficiency in the near future, but we are convinced that even without the conjecture proven our results provide a novel and deep insight into relationship between quantum algorithms and quantum metrology protocols."
1638,1412.4131,2014,1,15,11,Nonlocality in instantaneous quantum circuits,Joel J Wallman;Emily Adlam,"We show that families of Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuits corresponding to nontrivial Bell tests exhibit nonlocality. However, we also prove that this nonlocality can only be demonstrated using post-selection or nonlinear processing of the measurement outcomes. Therefore if the output of a computation is encoded in the parity of the measurement outcomes, then families of IQP circuits whose full output distributions are hard to sample still only provide a computational advantage relative to locally causal theories under post-selection. Consequently, post-selection is a crucial technique for obtaining a computational advantage for IQP circuits (with respect to decision problems) and for demonstrating nonlocality within IQP circuits, suggesting a strong link between these phenomena."

In this work we consider situations in which various parties have access to a restricted set of measurements on their particles, and construct entangled quantum states that are essentially classical for those measurements. In particular, given any set of local measurements on a large enough Hilbert space whose dual strictly contains (i.e. contains an open neighborhood of) a pure state, we use the PEPS formalism and ideas from generalized probabilistic theories to construct pure multiparty entangled states that have (a) local hidden variable models, and (b) can be efficiently simulated classically. We believe that the examples we construct cannot be efficiently classically simulated using previous techniques. Without the restriction on the measurements, the states that we construct are non-local, and in some proof-of-principle cases are universal for measurement based quantum computation."

The key step is to use sampling to approximately solve the Fokker-Planck equation derived from the Lindblad generators. An important computational advantage of this method, compared to other variational approaches to mixed state dynamics, is that it is ""embarrassingly parallel""."
1641,1411.5111,2014,12,16,11,Heisenberg-limited metrology with information recycling,Simon A Haine;Stuart S Szigeti;Matthias D Lang;Carlton M Caves,"Information recycling has been shown to improve the sensitivity of atom interferometers by exploiting atom-light entanglement. In this paper, we apply information recycling to an interferometer where the input quantum state has been partially transferred from some donor system. We demonstrate that when the quantum state of this donor system is from a particular class of number-correlated Heisenberg-limited states, information recycling yields a Heisenberg-limited phase measurement. Crucially, this result holds irrespective of the fraction of the quantum state transferred to the interferometer input and also for a general class of number-conserving quantum-state-transfer processes, including ones that destroy the first-order phase coherence between the branches of the interferometer. This result could have significant applications in Heisenberg-limited atom interferometry, where the quantum state is transferred from a Heisenberg-limited photon source, and in optical interferometry where the loss can be monitored."
1642,1410.3918,2014,12,12,11,Privacy Amplification in the Isolated Qubits Model,Yi-Kai Liu,"Isolated qubits are a special class of quantum devices, which can be used to implement tamper-resistant cryptographic hardware such as one-time memories (OTM's). Unfortunately, these OTM constructions leak some information, and standard methods for privacy amplification cannot be applied here, because the adversary has advance knowledge of the hash function that the honest parties will use. In this paper we show a stronger form of privacy amplification that solves this problem, using a fixed hash function that is secure against all possible adversaries in the isolated qubits model. This allows us to construct single-bit OTM's which only leak an exponentially small amount of information. We then study a natural generalization of the isolated qubits model, where the adversary is allowed to perform a polynomially-bounded number of entangling gates, in addition to unbounded local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We show that our technique for privacy amplification is also secure in this setting."

Our bounds are tighter than previously known best bounds for the latter two sub-tasks. A key technical tool that we use is a \em convex-split lemma which may be of independent interest.
1644,1410.1443,2014,11,20,11,"Rényi squashed entanglement, discord, and relative entropy differences",Kaushik P Seshadreesan;Mario Berta;Mark M Wilde,"In [Berta et al., J. Math. Phys. 56, 022205 (2015)], we recently proposed Renyi generalizations of the conditional quantum mutual information of a tripartite state on $ABC$ (with $C$ being the conditioning system), which were shown to satisfy some properties that hold for the original quantity, such as non-negativity, duality, and monotonicity with respect to local operations on the system $B$ (with it being left open to show that the Renyi quantity is monotone with respect to local operations on system $A$). Here we define a Renyi squashed entanglement and a Renyi quantum discord based on a Renyi conditional quantum mutual information and investigate these quantities in detail. Taking as a conjecture that the Renyi conditional quantum mutual information is monotone with respect to local operations on both systems $A$ and $B$, we prove that the Renyi squashed entanglement and the Renyi quantum discord satisfy many of the properties of the respective original von Neumann entropy based quantities. In our prior work [Berta et al., Phys. Rev. A 91, 022333 (2015)], we also detailed a procedure to obtain Renyi generalizations of any quantum information measure that is equal to a linear combination of von Neumann entropies with coefficients chosen from the set $\{-1,0,1\}$. Here, we extend this procedure to include differences of relative entropies. Using the extended procedure and a conjectured monotonicity of the Renyi generalizations in the Renyi parameter, we discuss potential remainder terms for well known inequalities such as monotonicity of the relative entropy, joint convexity of the relative entropy, and the Holevo bound."
1645,1410.1441,2014,10,16,11,"Fidelity of recovery, geometric squashed entanglement, and measurement recoverability",Kaushik P Seshadreesan;Mark M Wilde,"This paper defines the fidelity of recovery of a quantum state on systems $A$, $B$, and $C$ as a measure of how well one can recover the full state on all three systems if system $A$ is lost and a recovery operation is performed on system $C$ alone. The surprisal of the fidelity of recovery (its negative logarithm) is an information quantity which obeys nearly all of the properties of the conditional quantum mutual information $I(A;B|C)$, including non-negativity, monotonicity with respect to local operations, duality, invariance with respect to local isometries, a dimension bound, and continuity. We then define a (pseudo) entanglement measure based on this quantity, which we call the geometric squashed entanglement. We prove that the geometric squashed entanglement is a 1-LOCC monotone, that it vanishes if and only if the state on which it is evaluated is unentangled, and that it reduces to the geometric measure of entanglement if the state is pure. We also show that it is invariant with respect to local isometries, subadditive, continuous, and normalized on maximally entangled states. We next define the surprisal of measurement recoverability, which is an information quantity in the spirit of quantum discord, characterizing how well one can recover a share of a bipartite state if it is measured. We prove that this discord-like quantity satisfies several properties, including non-negativity, faithfulness on classical-quantum states, invariance with respect to local isometries, a dimension bound, and normalization on maximally entangled states. This quantity combined with a recent breakthrough of Fawzi and Renner allows to characterize states with discord nearly equal to zero as being approximate fixed points of entanglement breaking channels. Finally, we discuss a multipartite fidelity of recovery and several of its properties."

By means of that we then estimate (from below) the output entropy of the tensor product of dephasing channel with an arbitrary channel. Finally, we provide a characterization of all phase-damping channels resulting as particular cases of dephasing channels."
1647,1409.4807,2014,10,7,11,On the structure of LOCC: finite vs. infinite rounds,Scott M Cohen,"Every measurement that can be implemented by local quantum operations and classical communication (LOCC) using an infinite number of rounds is the limit of a sequence of measurements each of which requires only a finite number of rounds. This rather obvious and well-known fact is nonetheless of interest as it shows that these infinite-round measurements can be approximated arbitrarily closely simply by using more and more rounds of communication. Here we demonstrate the perhaps less obvious result that (at least) for bipartite systems, the reverse relationship also holds. Specifically, we show that every finite-round bipartite LOCC measurement is the limit of a continuous sequence of LOCC measurements, where each measurement in that sequence can be implemented by LOCC, but only with the use of an infinite number of rounds. Thus, the set of LOCC measurements that require an infinite number of rounds is dense in the entirety of LOCC, as is the set of finite-round LOCC measurements. This means there exist measurements that can only be implemented by LOCC by using an infinite number of rounds, but can nonetheless be approximated closely by using one round of communication, and actually in some cases, no communication is needed at all. These results follow from a new necessary condition for finite-round LOCC, which is extremely simple to check, is very easy to prove, and which can be violated by utilizing an infinite number of rounds."
1648,1409.3258,2014,10,7,11,Stochastic independence as a resource in small-scale thermodynamics,Matteo Lostaglio;Markus P Müller;Michele Pastena,"It is well-known in thermodynamics that the creation of correlations costs work. It seems then a truism that if a thermodynamic transformation A->B is impossible, so will be any transformation that in sending A to B also correlates among them some auxiliary systems C. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case for non-equilibrium thermodynamics of microscopic systems. On the contrary, the creation of correlations greatly extends the set of accessible states, to the point that we can perform on individual systems and in a single shot any transformation that would otherwise be possible only if the number of systems involved was very large. We also show that one only ever needs to create a vanishingly small amount of correlations (as measured by mutual information) among a small number of auxiliary systems (never more than three). The many, severe constraints of microscopic thermodynamics are reduced to the sole requirement that the non-equilibrium free energy decreases in the transformation. This shows that, in principle, reliable extraction of work equal to the free energy of a system can be performed by microscopic engines."

This suggests that, under certain reasonable noise models, the probability distributions produced by noisy BosonSampling are very sensitive to noise. We also show that when the amount of noise is constant the noisy value of |permanent(X)|^2 can be approximated efficiently on a classical computer. These results seem to weaken the possibility of demonstrating quantum-speedup via BosonSampling without quantum fault-tolerance."

Specific results that we prove include: an exact formula for the optimal probability of correctly discriminating any set of either three or four Bell states via LOCC or separable measurements when the parties are given an ancillary partially entangled pair of qubits; an easily checkable characterization of when an unextendable product set is perfectly discriminated by separable measurements, along with the first known example of an unextendable product set that cannot be perfectly discriminated by separable measurements; and an optimal bound on the success probability for any LOCC or separable measurement for the recently proposed state discrimination problem of Yu, Duan, and Ying."

The definition of the $\alpha$-$z$-relative Rényi entropy unifies all previously proposed definitions of the quantum Rényi divergence of order $\alpha$ under a common framework. Here we will prove that the $\alpha$-$z$-relative Rényi entropies are a proper generalization of the quantum relative entropy by computing the limit of the $\alpha$-$z$ divergence as $\alpha$ approaches one and $z$ is an arbitrary function of $\alpha$. We also show that certain operationally relevant families of Rényi divergences are differentiable at $\alpha = 1$. Finally, our analysis reveals that the derivative at $\alpha = 1$ evaluates to half the relative entropy variance, a quantity that has attained operational significance in second-order quantum hypothesis testing."

More generally, phase-insensitive bosonic channels model other kinds of noise, such as thermalizing or amplifying processes. Recent work has established the classical capacity of all of these channels, and furthermore, it is now known that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon number constraint. The goal of the present paper is to initiate the study of second-order coding rates for these channels, by beginning with the simplest one, the pure-loss bosonic channel. In a second-order analysis of communication, one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks to understand the back-off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finite number of channel uses. We find a lower bound on the maximum achievable code size for the pure-loss bosonic channel, in terms of the known expression for its capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion. We accomplish this by proving a general ""one-shot"" coding theorem for channels with classical inputs and pure-state quantum outputs which reside in a separable Hilbert space. The theorem leads to an optimal second-order characterization when the channel output is finite-dimensional, and it remains an open question to determine whether the characterization is optimal for the pure-loss bosonic channel."

In this paper, we consider the dual of this problem, 'observable conversion problem'. Given families of operators $\{L_\theta}\}_{\theta\in\Theta}$ and $\{M_\theta}\}_{\theta\in\Theta}$ , we ask whether there is a completely positive (sub) unital map which sends $\{L_\theta}\}$ to $\{M_\theta}\}$ for each \theta.

By making $N$ large enough, this magnetic moment can be made arbitrarily large. We show that, nevertheless, Bob can't read out of this large magnetic moment Alice's choice of measurement direction $\vec a$. We also consider stronger than quantum correlations and show that Tsirelson's bound follows from the physical assumption that in the macroscopic limit all measurements are compatible and that this should not lead to signaling."

Improving the purity is limited by fundamental laws of thermodynamics. Here we are probing the fundamental limits for a natural approach to this problem, namely heat-bath algorithmic cooling(HBAC). The existence of the cooling limit for HBAC techniques was proved by Schulman et al. in, the limit however remained unknown for the past decade. Here for the first time we find this limit. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, this corresponds to the maximum extractable work from the quantum system."
1657,1407.1169,2014,8,7,11,Diagonal unitary entangling gates and contradiagonal quantum states,Arul Lakshminarayan;Zbigniew Puchała;Karol Życzkowski,"Nonlocal properties of an ensemble of diagonal random unitary matrices of order $N^2$ are investigated. The average Schmidt strength of such a bipartite diagonal quantum gate is shown to scale as $\log N$, in contrast to the $\log N^2$ behavior characteristic to random unitary gates. Entangling power of a diagonal gate $U$ is related to the von Neumann entropy of an auxiliary quantum state $\rho=AA^{\dagger}/N^2$, where the square matrix $A$ is obtained by reshaping the vector of diagonal elements of $U$ of length $N^2$ into a square matrix of order $N$. This fact provides a motivation to study the ensemble of non-hermitian unimodular matrices $A$, with all entries of the same modulus and random phases and the ensemble of quantum states $\rho$, such that all their diagonal entries are equal to $1/N$. Such a state is contradiagonal with respect to the computational basis, in sense that among all unitary equivalent states it maximizes the entropy copied to the environment due to the coarse graining process. The first four moments of the squared singular values of the unimodular ensemble are derived, based on which we conjecture a connection to a recently studied combinatorial object called the ""Borel triangle"". This allows us to find exactly the mean von Neumann entropy for random phase density matrices and the average entanglement for the corresponding ensemble of bipartite pure states."
1658,1406.6898,2014,7,31,11,Information complementarity: A new paradigm for decoding quantum incompatibility,Huangjun Zhu,"The existence of observables that are incompatible or not jointly measurable is a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics, which lies at the root of a number of nonclassical phenomena, such as uncertainty relations, wave--particle dual behavior, Bell-inequality violation, and contextuality. However, no intuitive criterion is available for determining the compatibility of even two (generalized) observables, despite the overarching importance of this problem and intensive efforts of many researchers. Here we introduce an information theoretic paradigm together with an intuitive geometric picture for decoding incompatible observables, starting from two simple ideas: Every observable can only provide limited information and information is monotonic under data processing. By virtue of quantum estimation theory, we introduce a family of universal criteria for detecting incompatible observables and a natural measure of incompatibility, which are applicable to arbitrary number of arbitrary observables. Based on this framework, we derive a family of universal measurement uncertainty relations, provide a simple information theoretic explanation of quantitative wave--particle duality, and offer new perspectives for understanding Bell nonlocality, contextuality, and quantum precision limit."

Let $\epsilon,n,\eta$ be the energy gap, the system size, and the desired precision, respectively. Neglecting $\epsilon$-dependent subpolynomial (in $n$) and constant factors, the running time of the algorithm is $n^{O(1)}$ for $\eta=n^{-O(1)}$."

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions, in the form of a family of linear inequalities, which the spectrum has to verify. Our conditions become explicit when one of the two subsystems is a qubit, as well as for further sets of states. Finally, we introduce a family of simple entanglement criteria for spectra, closely related to the reduction and positive partial transpose criteria, which also provide new insight into the set of spectra that guarantee separability or positivity of the partial transpose."

This property says that if an observable commutes with all observables localised outside the cone region, it actually is an element of the von Neumann algebra generated by the local observables inside the cone. This strengthens locality, which says that observables localised in disjoint regions commute. As an application we consider the superselection structure of the quantum double model for abelian groups on an infinite lattice in the spirit of the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts program in algebraic quantum field theory. We find that, as is the case for the toric code model on an infinite lattice, the superselection structure is given by the category of irreducible representations of the quantum double."

However, when close to a quantum phase transition, its calculation becomes cumbersome. Here we show how topological phase transitions in 2d systems can be much better assessed by multipartite entanglement, as measured by the topological geometric entanglement of blocks. Specifically, we present an efficient tensor network algorithm based on Projected Entangled Pair States to compute this quantity for a torus partitioned into cylinders, and then use this method to find sharp evidence of topological phase transitions in 2d systems with a string-tension perturbation. When compared to tensor network methods for Rényi entropies, our approach produces almost perfect accuracies close to criticality and, on top, is orders of magnitude faster. The method can be adapted to deal with any topological state of the system, including minimally entangled ground states. It also allows to extract the critical exponent of the correlation length, and shows that there is no continuous entanglement-loss along renormalization group flows in topological phases."
1663,1405.4066,2014,6,6,11,Majorization and additivity for multimode bosonic Gaussian channels,Vittorio Giovannetti;A S Holevo;Andrea Mari,"Recently, the longstanding Gaussian optimizer conjecture was proven for bosonic Gaussian gauge-covariant or contravariant channels in the work of Giovannetti, Holevo and Garcia-Patron [3]. In the paper of Mari, Giovannetti and Holevo [11] this result was strengthened for one-mode channels by establishing that the output for the vacuum or coherent input majorizes the output for any other input. In the present paper we give the multimode extension of the result of [11], including sufficient conditions under which the coherent states are the only optimizers. We also discuss direct implications of this multimode majorization result to the positive solution of the additivity problem for the Gaussian channels. In particular, we demonstrate the additivity of the output Renyi entropies of arbitrary order p>1. Finally, we present an alternative derivation of a majorization property of Glauber's coherent states by Lieb and Solovej [10], basing on the method of the work [3]."
1664,1405.3988,2014,6,5,11,Information transmission without energy exchange,Robert H Jonsson;Eduardo Martin-Martinez;Achim Kempf,"We show that it is possible to use a massless field in the vacuum to communicate in such a way that the signal travels arbitrarily slower than the speed of light and such that no energy is transmitted from the sender to the receiver. Instead, the receiver has to supply a signal-dependent amount of work to switch his detector on and off. Because of that, this kind of communication without energy exchange may be called ""Quantum Collect Calling"". This type of communication is related to Casimir-like interactions and it is made possible by dimension ---and curvature--- dependent subtleties of Huygens' principle."
1665,1405.3259,2014,6,4,11,Algorithms for finite Projected Entangled Pair States,Michael Lubasch;J Ignacio Cirac;Mari-Carmen Bañuls,"Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are a promising ansatz for the study of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems in two dimensions. But due to their high computational cost, developing and improving PEPS algorithms is necessary to make the ansatz widely usable in practice. Here we analyze several algorithmic aspects of the method. On the one hand, we quantify the connection between the correlation length of the PEPS and the accuracy of its approximate contraction, and discuss how purifications can be used in the latter. On the other, we present algorithmic improvements for the update of the tensor that introduce drastic gains in the numerical conditioning and the efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the state-of-the-art general PEPS code is benchmarked with the Heisenberg and quantum Ising models on lattices of up to $21 \times 21$ sites."
1666,1405.0262,2014,5,19,11,Steering bound entangled states: A counterexample to the stronger Peres conjecture,Tobias Moroder;Oleg Gittsovich;Marcus Huber;Otfried Gühne,"Quantum correlations are at the heart of many applications in quantum information science and, at the same time, they form the basis for discussions about genuine quantum effects and their difference to classical physics. On one hand, entanglement theory provides the tools to quantify correlations in information processing and many results have been obtained to discriminate useful entanglement, which can be distilled to a pure form, from bound entanglement, being of limited use in many applications. On the other hand, for discriminating quantum phenomena from their classical counterparts, Schrödinger and Bell introduced the notions of steering and local hidden variable models. We provide a method to generate systematically bound entangled quantum states which can still be used for steering and therefore to rule out local hidden state models. This sheds light on the relations between the various views on quantum correlations and disproves a widespread conjecture known as the stronger Peres conjecture. For practical applications, it implies that even the weakest form of entanglement can be certified in a semi-device independent way."
1667,1404.2877,2014,5,19,11,Quantum process tomography of unitary and near-unitary maps,Charles H Baldwin;Amir Kalev;Ivan H Deutsch,"We study quantum process tomography given the prior information that the map is a unitary or close to a unitary process. We show that a unitary map on a $d$-level system is completely characterized by a minimal set of $d^2{+}d$ elements associated with a collection of POVMs, in contrast to the $d^4{-}d^2$ elements required for a general completely positive trace-preserving map. To achieve this lower bound, one must probe the map with a particular set of $d$ pure states. We further compare the performance of different compressed sensing algorithms used to reconstruct a near-unitary process from such data. We find that when we have accurate prior information, an appropriate compressed sensing method reduces the required data needed for high-fidelity estimation, and different estimators applied to the same data are sensitive to different types of noise. Compressed sensing techniques can therefore be used both as indicators of error models and to validate the use of the prior assumptions."
1668,1403.8143,2014,5,14,11,Quantum resources for purification and cooling: fundamental limits and opportunities,Francesco Ticozzi;Lorenza Viola,"Preparing a quantum system in a pure state is ultimately limited by the nature of the system's evolution in the presence of its environment and by the initial state of the environment itself. We show that, when the system and environment are initially uncorrelated and arbitrary joint unitary dynamics is allowed, the system may be purified up to a certain (possibly arbitrarily small) threshold if and only if its environment, either natural or engineered, contains a ""virtual subsystem"" which has the same dimension and is in a state with the desired purity. Beside providing a unified understanding of quantum purification dynamics in terms of a ""generalized swap process,"" our results shed light on the significance of a no-go theorem for exact ground-state cooling, as well as on the quantum resources needed for achieving an intended purification task."

Here, we study a prototypical example in a clean and well-controlled ultracold atom setup by observing the emergence of coherence when crossing the Mott insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition. In the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, we find perfect agreement between experimental observations and numerical simulations for the resulting coherence length. We thereby perform a largely certified analogue quantum simulation of this strongly correlated system reaching beyond the regime of free quasiparticles. Experimentally, we additionally explore the emergence of coherence in higher dimensions where no classical simulations are available, as well as for negative temperatures. For intermediate quench velocities, we observe a power-law behaviour of the coherence length, reminiscent of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. However, we find exponents that strongly depend on the final interaction strength and thus lie outside the scope of this mechanism."
1670,1403.6132,2014,4,11,11,Degenerate Adiabatic Perturbation Theory: Foundations and Applications,Gustavo Rigolin;Gerardo Ortiz,"We present details and expand on the framework leading to the recently introduced degenerate adiabatic perturbation theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 170406 (2010)], and on the formulation of the degenerate adiabatic theorem, along with its necessary and sufficient conditions given in [Phys. Rev. A 85, 062111 (2012)]. We start with the adiabatic approximation for degenerate Hamiltonians that paves the way to a clear and rigorous statement of the associated degenerate adiabatic theorem, where the non-abelian geometric phase (Wilczek-Zee phase) plays a central role to its quantitative formulation. We then describe the degenerate adiabatic perturbation theory, whose zeroth order term is the degenerate adiabatic approximation, in its full generality. The parameter in the perturbative power series expansion of the time-dependent wave function is directly associated to the inverse of the time it takes to drive the system from its initial to its final state. With the aid of the degenerate adiabatic perturbation theory we obtain rigorous necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. Finally, to illustrate the power and wide scope of the methodology, we apply the framework to a degenerate Hamiltonian, whose closed form time-dependent wave function is derived exactly, and also to other non-exactly-solvable Hamiltonians whose solutions are numerically computed."
1671,1403.5003,2014,4,1,11,Multi-party zero-error classical channel coding with entanglement,Teresa Piovesan;Giannicola Scarpa;Christian Schaffner,"We study the effects of quantum entanglement on the performance of two classical zero-error communication tasks among multiple parties. Both tasks are generalizations of the two-party zero-error channel-coding problem, where a sender and a receiver want to perfectly communicate messages through a one-way classical noisy channel. If the two parties are allowed to share entanglement, there are several positive results that show the existence of channels for which they can communicate strictly more than what they could do with classical resources. In the first task, one sender wants to communicate a common message to multiple receivers. We show that if the number of receivers is greater than a certain threshold then entanglement does not allow for an improvement in the communication for any finite number of uses of the channel. On the other hand, when the number of receivers is fixed, we exhibit a class of channels for which entanglement gives an advantage. The second problem we consider features multiple collaborating senders and one receiver. Classically, cooperation among the senders might allow them to communicate on average more messages than the sum of their individual possibilities. We show that whenever a channel allows single-sender entanglement-assisted advantage, then the gain extends also to the multi-sender case. Furthermore, we show that entanglement allows for a peculiar amplification of information which cannot happen classically, for a fixed number of uses of a channel with multiple senders."

Especially we consider excited states obtained by acting primary operators on a vacuum. We show that under its time evolution, entanglement entropy increases by a finite constant when the causality condition is satisfied. Moreover, in rational CFTs, we prove that this increased amount of (both Renyi and von-Neumann) entanglement entropy always coincides with the log of quantum dimension of the primary operator."

This calls for more advanced techniques in a future global quantum network, e.g. for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation of an entangled state, i.e. entanglement swapping, representing the central resource to relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater. Since the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in real-world scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a free-space entanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 standard deviations beyond the classical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the independence of the nodes is highly demanded. Since our results already allow for efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our assay to lay the ground for a fully-fledged quantum repeater over a realistic high-loss and even turbulent quantum channel."
1674,1402.5927,2014,3,21,11,Limitations on Quantum Key Repeaters,Stefan Bäuml;Matthias Christandl;Karol Horodecki;Andreas Winter,"A major application of quantum communication is the distribution of entangled particles for use in quantum key distribution (QKD). Due to noise in the communication line, QKD is in practice limited to a distance of a few hundred kilometres, and can only be extended to longer distances by use of a quantum repeater, a device which performs entanglement distillation and quantum teleportation. The existence of noisy entangled states that are undistillable but nevertheless useful for QKD raises the question of the feasibility of a quantum key repeater, which would work beyond the limits of entanglement distillation, hence possibly tolerating higher noise levels than existing protocols. Here we exhibit fundamental limits on such a device in the form of bounds on the rate at which it may extract secure key. As a consequence, we give examples of states suitable for QKD but unsuitable for the most general quantum key repeater protocol."
1675,1402.5722,2014,3,5,11,Entropic uncertainty from effective anti-commutators,Jędrzej Kaniewski;Marco Tomamichel;Stephanie Wehner,"We investigate entropic uncertainty relations for two or more binary measurements, for example spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ or polarisation measurements. We argue that the effective anti-commutators of these measurements, i.e. the anti-commutators evaluated on the state prior to measuring, are an expedient measure of measurement incompatibility. Based on the knowledge of pairwise effective anti-commutators we derive a class of entropic uncertainty relations in terms of conditional Rényi entropies. Our uncertainty relations are formulated in terms of effective measures of incompatibility, which can be certified device-independently. Consequently, we discuss potential applications of our findings to device-independent quantum cryptography. Moreover, to investigate the tightness of our analysis we consider the simplest (and very well-studied) scenario of two measurements on a qubit. We find that our results outperform the celebrated bound due to Maassen and Uffink [Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 1103 (1988)] and provide a new analytical expression for the minimum uncertainty which also outperforms some recent bounds based on majorisation."

Here we provide a method to detect Chern numbers in systems with two distinct species of fermion, such as spins, orbitals or several atomic states. We analytically show that the Chern number can be decomposed as a sum of component specific winding numbers, which are themselves physically observable. We apply this method to two systems, the quantum spin Hall insulator and a staggered topological superconductor, and show that (spin) Chern numbers are accurately reproduced. The measurements required for constructing the component winding numbers also enable one to probe the entanglement spectrum with respect to component partitions. Our method is particularly suited to experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices where time-of-flight images can give direct access to the relevant observables."
1677,1402.0619,2014,2,25,11,Precise estimation of critical exponents from real-space renormalization group analysis,Aleksander Kubica;Beni Yoshida,"We develop a novel real-space renormalization group (RG) scheme which accurately estimates correlation length exponent $\nu$ near criticality of higher-dimensional quantum Ising and Potts models in a transverse field. Our method is remarkably simple (often analytical), grouping only a few spins into a block spin so that renormalized Hamiltonian has a closed form. A previous difficulty of spatial anisotropy and unwanted terms is avoided by incorporating rotational invariance and internal $\mathbb{Z}_q$ symmetries of the Hamiltonian. By applying this scheme to the (2+1)-dim Ising model on a triangular lattice and solving an analytical RG equation, we obtain $\nu\approx 0.6300$. This value is within statistical errors of the current best Monte-Carlo result, 25th-order high-temperature series expansions, $\phi^4$-theory estimation which considers up to seven-loop corrections and experiments performed in low-Earth orbits. We also apply the scheme to higher-dimensional Potts models for which ordinary Monte-Carlo methods are not effective due to strong hysteresis and suppression of quantum fluctuation in a weak first-order phase transition."
1678,1402.0489,2014,2,25,11,Robust protocols for securely expanding randomness and distributing keys using untrusted quantum devices,Carl A Miller;Yaoyun Shi,"Randomness is a vital resource for modern day information processing, especially for cryptography. A wide range of applications critically rely on abundant, high quality random numbers generated securely. Here we show how to expand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying quantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries, and has the following new features: cryptographic level of security, tolerating a constant level of imprecision in the devices, requiring only a unit size quantum memory per device component for the honest implementation, and allowing a large natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunct with a recent work by Chung, Shi and Wu, it also leads to robust unbounded expansion using just 2 multi-part devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing that the Renyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific bounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of the proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements, and a method for simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices."
1679,1401.7997,2014,2,14,11,Relative Thermalization,Lídia del Rio;Adrian Hutter;Renato Renner;Stephanie Wehner,"When studying thermalization of quantum systems, it is typical to ask whether a system interacting with an environment will evolve towards a local thermal state. Here, we show that a more general and relevant question is ""when does a system thermalize relative to a particular reference?"" By relative thermalization we mean that, as well as being in a local thermal state, the system is uncorrelated with the reference. We argue that this is necessary in order to apply standard statistical mechanics to the study of the interaction between a thermalized system and a reference. We then derive a condition for relative thermalization of quantum systems interacting with an arbitrary environment. This condition has two components: the first is state-independent, reflecting the structure of invariant subspaces, like energy shells, and the relative sizes of system and environment; the second depends on the initial correlations between reference, system and environment, measured in terms of conditional entropies. Intuitively, a small system interacting with a large environment is likely to thermalize relative to a reference, but only if, initially, the reference was not highly correlated with the system and environment. Our statement makes this intuition precise, and we show that in many natural settings this thermalization condition is approximately tight. Established results on thermalization, which usually ignore the reference, follow as special cases of our statements."
1680,1401.4243,2014,2,5,11,Quantum randomness extraction for various levels of characterization of the devices,Yun Zhi Law;Le Phuc Thinh;Jean-Daniel Bancal;Valerio Scarani,"The amount of intrinsic randomness that can be extracted from measurement on quantum systems depends on several factors: notably, the power given to the adversary and the level of characterization of the devices of the authorized partners. After presenting a systematic introduction to these notions, in this paper we work in the class of least adversarial power, which is relevant for assessing setups operated by trusted experimentalists, and compare three levels of characterization of the devices. Many recent studies have focused on the so-called ""device-independent"" level, in which a lower bound on the amount of intrinsic randomness can be certified without any characterization. The other extreme is the case when all the devices are fully characterized: this ""tomographic"" level has been known for a long time. We present for this case a systematic and efficient approach to quantifying the amount of intrinsic randomness, and show that setups involving ancillas (POVMs, pointer measurements) may not be interesting here, insofar as one may extract randomness from the ancilla rather than from the system under study. Finally, we study how much randomness can be obtained in presence of an intermediate level of characterization related to the task of ""steering"", in which Bob's device is fully characterized while Alice's is a black box. We obtain our results here by adapting the NPA hierarchy of semidefinite programs to the steering scenario."
1681,1312.4392,2013,2,4,11,Measurement uncertainty relations,Paul Busch;Pekka Lahti;Reinhard F Werner,"Measurement uncertainty relations are quantitative bounds on the errors in an approximate joint measurement of two observables. They can be seen as a generalization of the error/disturbance tradeoff first discussed heuristically by Heisenberg. Here we prove such relations for the case of two canonically conjugate observables like position and momentum, and establish a close connection with the more familiar preparation uncertainty relations constraining the sharpness of the distributions of the two observables in the same state. Both sets of relations are generalized to means of order $\alpha$ rather than the usual quadratic means, and we show that the optimal constants are the same for preparation and for measurement uncertainty. The constants are determined numerically and compared with some bounds in the literature. In both cases the near-saturation of the inequalities entails that the state (resp. observable) is uniformly close to a minimizing one."

To perform a numerical analysis, we use the Quantum Resource Estimator Toolbox (QuRE) that we recently developed. We use QuRE to estimate the number of qubits, quantum gates, and amount of time needed to factor a 1024-bit number on several candidate quantum technologies that differ in their clock speed and reliability. We make several interesting observations. First, topological quantum error correction requires fewer resources when physical gate error rates are high, white concatenated codes have smaller overhead for physical gate error rates below approximately 10E-7. Consequently, we show that different error-correcting codes should be chosen for two of the studied physical quantum technologies - ion traps and superconducting qubits. Second, we observe that the composition of the elementary gate types occurring in a typical logical circuit, a fault-tolerant circuit protected by the surface code, and a fault-tolerant circuit protected by a concatenated code all differ. This also suggests that choosing the most appropriate error correction technique depends on the ability of the future technology to perform specific gates efficiently."

Under a natural assumption, we show that the output set converges to a compact convex set, clarifying and substantially generalizing results in [BCN13]. Random mixed unitary channels satisfy the assumption; we give a formula for the asymptotic maximum output infinity norm and we show that the minimum output entropy and the Holevo capacity have a simple relation for the complementary channels. We also give non-trivial examples of sequences $\Phi_n$ such that along with any other quantum channel $\Xi$, we have convergence of the output set of $\Phi_n$ and $\Phi_n\otimes \Xi$ simultaneously; the case when $\Xi$ is entanglement breaking is investigated in details."

We describe a procedure to map electronic structure Hamiltonians to 2-local qubit Hamiltonians with a small set of physically realizable couplings. By combining the Bravyi-Kitaev construction to map fermions to qubits with perturbative gadgets to reduce the Hamiltonian to 2-local, we obtain precision requirements on the coupling strengths and a number of ancilla qubits that scale polynomially in the problem size. Hence our mapping is efficient. The required set of controllable interactions includes only two types of interaction beyond the Ising interactions required to apply the quantum adiabatic algorithm to combinatorial optimization problems. Our mapping may also be of interest to chemists directly as it defines a dictionary from electronic structure to spin Hamiltonians with physical interactions."

Here we report on a surprising relation between conditional Renyi entropies based on this new generalization and conditional Renyi entropies based on the quantum relative Renyi entropy that was used in previous literature. Our result generalizes the well-known duality relation H(A|B) + H(A|C) = 0 of the conditional von Neumann entropy for tripartite pure states to Renyi entropies of two different kinds. As a direct application, we prove a collection of inequalities that relate different conditional Renyi entropies and derive a new entropic uncertainty relation."

This chapter investigates CTQEC based on continuous weak measurements and feedback from the point of view of the subsystem principle, which states that protected quantum information is contained in a subsystem of the Hilbert space. We study how to approach the problem of constructing CTQEC protocols by looking at the evolution of the state of the system in an encoded basis in which the subsystem containing the protected information is explicit. This point of view allows us to reduce the problem to that of protecting a known state, and to design CTQEC procedures from protocols for the protection of a single qubit. We show how previously studied CTQEC schemes with both direct and indirect feedback can be obtained from strategies for the protection of a single qubit via weak measurements and weak unitary operations. We also review results on the performance of CTQEC with direct feedback in cases of Markovian and non-Markovian decoherence, where we have shown that due to the existence of a Zeno regime in non-Markovian dynamics, the performance of CTQEC can exhibit a quadratic improvement if the time resolution of the weak error-correcting operations is high enough to reveal the non-Markovian character of the noise process."

Our construction gives interactive proofs for all languages in BQP with a polynomial number of quantum provers, each of which, in the honest case, performs only a single measurement. Our techniques use self-tested graph states which allow us to test the provers for honesty, establishing that they hold onto a particular graph state and measure it in specified bases. In this extended abstract we give an overview of the construction and proofs."
1688,1311.1533,2013,11,18,11,General quantum error-correcting code with entanglement based on codeword stabilized quantum code,Jeonghwan Shin;Jun Heo;Todd A Brun,"In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to construct entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes, including additive and nonadditive codes, based on the codeword stabilized framework on subsystems. The codeword stabilized (CWS) framework is a scheme to construct quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) including both additive and nonadditive codes, and gives a method to construct a QECC from a classical error-correcting code in standard form. Entangled pairs of qubits (ebits) can be used to improve capacity of quantum error correction. In addition, it gives a method to overcome the dual-containing constraint. Operator quantum error correction (OQEC) gives a general framework to construct quantum error-correcting codes. We construct OQEC codes with ebits based on the CWS framework. This new scheme, entanglement-assisted operator codeword stabilized (EAOCWS) quantum codes, is the most general framework we know of to construct both additive and nonadditive codes from classical error-correcting codes. We describe the formalism of our scheme, demonstrate the construction with examples, and give several EAOCWS codes."
1689,1310.7787,2013,11,12,11,Parallel Repetition of Entangled Games with Exponential Decay via the Superposed Information Cost,André Chailloux;Giannicola Scarpa,"In a two-player game, two cooperating but non communicating players, Alice and Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution. Each of them produces an output and they win the game if they satisfy some predicate on their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega^*(G)$ of a game $G$ is the maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to share an entangled state prior to receiving their inputs. The $n$-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$ consists of $n$ instances of $G$ where the players receive all the inputs at the same time and produce all the outputs at the same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each instance of $G$. In this paper we show that for any game $G$ such that $\omega^*(G) = 1 - \varepsilon < 1$, $\omega^*(G^n)$ decreases exponentially in $n$. First, for any game $G$ on the uniform distribution, we show that $\omega^*(G^n) = (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\log(|I||O|)} - |\log(\varepsilon)|\right)}$, where $|I|$ and $|O|$ are the sizes of the input and output sets. From this result, we show that for any entangled game $G$, $\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega(\frac{n}{Q\log(|I||O|)} - \frac{|\log(\varepsilon)|}{Q})}$ where $p$ is the input distribution of $G$ and $Q= \frac{|I|^2 \max_{xy} p_{xy}^2 }{\min_{xy} p_{xy} }$. This implies parallel repetition with exponential decay as long as $\min_{xy} \{p_{xy}\} \neq 0$ for general games. To prove this parallel repetition, we introduce the concept of \emphSuperposed Information Cost for entangled games which is inspired from the information cost used in communication complexity."
1690,1310.6755,2013,11,8,11,Infinite Randomness Expansion and Amplification with a Constant Number of Devices,Matthew Coudron;Henry Yuen,"We present a device-independent randomness expansion protocol, involving only a constant number of non-signaling quantum devices, that achieves \emphinfinite expansion: starting with $m$ bits of uniform private randomness, the protocol can produce an unbounded amount of certified randomness that is $\exp(-\Omega(m^{1/3}))$-close to uniform and secure against a quantum adversary. The only parameters which depend on the size of the input are the soundness of the protocol and the security of the output (both are inverse exponential in $m$). This settles a long-standing open problem in the area of randomness expansion and device-independence. The analysis of our protocols involves overcoming fundamental challenges in the study of \emphadaptive device-independent protocols. Our primary technical contribution is the design and analysis of device-independent protocols which are \emphInput Secure; that is, their output is guaranteed to be secure against a quantum eavesdropper, \empheven if the input randomness was generated by that same eavesdropper! The notion of Input Security may be of independent interest to other areas such as device-independent quantum key distribution."
1691,1310.4507,2013,11,8,11,Bifurcation in entanglement renormalization group flow of a gapped spin model,Jeongwan Haah,"We study entanglement renormalization group transformations for the ground states of a spin model, called cubic code model $H_A$ in three dimensions, in order to understand long-range entanglement structure. The cubic code model has degenerate and locally indistinguishable ground states under periodic boundary conditions. In the entanglement renormalization, one applies local unitary transformations on a state, called disentangling transformations, after which some of the spins are completely disentangled from the rest and then discarded. We find a disentangling unitary to establish equivalence of the ground state of $H_A$ on a lattice of lattice spacing $a$ to the tensor product of ground spaces of two independent Hamiltonians $H_A$ and $H_B$ on lattices of lattice spacing $2a$. We further find a disentangling unitary for the ground space of $H_B$ with the lattice spacing $a$ to show that it decomposes into two copies of itself on the lattice of the lattice spacing $2a$. The disentangling transformations yield a tensor network description for the ground state of the cubic code model. Using exact formulas for the degeneracy as a function of system size, we show that the two Hamiltonians $H_A$ and $H_B$ represent distinct phases of matter."
1692,1310.4473,2013,10,30,11,Local Records and Global Entanglement: A Unique Multi-Partite Generalization of the Schmidt Decomposition,C Jess Riedel,"We show that there is a unique maximal decomposition of a pure multi-partite (N>2) quantum state into a sum of states which are ""locally orthogonal"" in the sense that the local reduced state for a term in the sum lives in its own orthogonal subspace for each subsystem. Observers can make local measurements on any subsystem and determine which ""branch"" they are on. The Shannon entropy of the resulting branch weights defines a new measure of global, GHZ-like entanglement, which is insensitive to local pairwise entangling operations and vanishes when there is no piece of information recorded at every subsystem. In the bi-partite (N=2) case, this decomposition reduces to the (not necessarily unique) Schmidt decomposition and the entropy reduces to the entropy of entanglement"
1693,1310.4153,2013,10,25,11,Hamiltonian quantum simulation with bounded-strength controls,Adam D Bookatz;Pawel Wocjan;Lorenza Viola,"We propose dynamical control schemes for Hamiltonian simulation in many-body quantum systems that avoid instantaneous control operations and rely solely on realistic bounded-strength control Hamiltonians. Each simulation protocol consists of periodic repetitions of a basic control block, constructed as a suitable modification of an ""Eulerian decoupling cycle,"" that would otherwise implement a trivial (zero) target Hamiltonian. For an open quantum system coupled to an uncontrollable environment, our approach may be employed to engineer an effective evolution that simulates a target Hamiltonian on the system, while suppressing unwanted decoherence to the leading order. We present illustrative applications to both closed- and open-system simulation settings, with emphasis on simulation of non-local (two-body) Hamiltonians using only local (one-body) controls. In particular, we provide simulation schemes applicable to Heisenberg-coupled spin chains exposed to general linear decoherence, and show how to simulate Kitaev's honeycomb lattice Hamiltonian starting from Ising-coupled qubits, as potentially relevant to the dynamical generation of a topologically protected quantum memory. Additional implications for quantum information processing are discussed."
1694,1310.2267,2013,10,17,11,A Partial Derandomization of PhaseLift using Spherical Designs,David Gross;F Krahmer;Richard Kueng,"The problem of retrieving phase information from amplitude measurements alone has appeared in many scientific disciplines over the last century. PhaseLift is a recently introduced algorithm for phase recovery that is computationally efficient, numerically stable, and comes with rigorous performance guarantees. PhaseLift is optimal in the sense that the number of amplitude measurements required for phase reconstruction scales linearly with the dimension of the signal. However, it specifically demands Gaussian random measurement vectors - a limitation that restricts practical utility and obscures the specific properties of measurement ensembles that enable phase retrieval. Here we present a partial derandomization of PhaseLift that only requires sampling from certain polynomial size vector configurations, called t-designs. Such configurations have been studied in algebraic combinatorics, coding theory, and quantum information. We prove reconstruction guarantees for a number of measurements that depends on the degree t of the design. If the degree is allowed to to grow logarithmically with the dimension, the bounds become tight up to polylog-factors. Beyond the specific case of PhaseLift, this work highlights the utility of spherical designs for the derandomization of data recovery schemes."
1695,1310.2155,2013,10,17,11,Lower Bounds for Quantum Parameter Estimation,Michael Walter;Joseph M Renes,"The laws of quantum mechanics place fundamental limits on the accuracy of measurements and therefore on the estimation of unknown parameters of a quantum system. In this work, we prove lower bounds on the size of confidence regions reported by any region estimator for a given ensemble of probe states and probability of success. Our bounds are derived from a previously unnoticed connection between the size of confidence regions and the error probabilities of a corresponding binary hypothesis test. In group-covariant scenarios, we find that there is an ultimate bound for any estimation scheme which depends only on the representation-theoretic data of the probe system, and we evaluate its asymptotics in the limit of many systems, establishing a general ""Heisenberg limit"" for region estimation. We apply our results to several examples, in particular to phase estimation, where our bounds allow us to recover the well-known Heisenberg and shot-noise scaling."

We first exploit volumetric methods to show that in a randomly chosen direction, there are PPT states whose distance in trace norm from separable states is (asymptotically) at least 1/4. We then provide explicit examples of PPT states which are nearly as far from separable ones as possible. To obtain a distance of 2-\epsilon from the separable states, we need a dimension of 2^poly(\log(1/\epsilon)), as opposed to 2^poly(1/\epsilon) given by the construction of Beigi and Shor. We do so by exploiting the so called \it private states, introduced earlier in the context of quantum cryptography. We also provide a lower bound for the distance between private states and PPT states and investigate the distance between pure states and the set of PPT states."
1697,1309.6736,2013,10,9,11,Programmable quantum simulation by dynamic Hamiltonian engineering,David L Hayes;Steven T Flammia;Michael J Biercuk,"Quantum simulation is a promising near term application for mesoscale quantum information processors, with the potential to solve computationally intractable problems at the scale of just a few dozen interacting quantum systems. Recent experiments in a range of technical platforms have demonstrated the basic functionality of quantum simulation applied to quantum magnetism, quantum phase transitions, and relativistic quantum mechanics. In all cases, the underlying hardware platforms restrict the achievable inter-particle interaction, forming a serious constraint on the ability to realize a versatile, programmable quantum simulator. In this work, we address this problem by developing novel sequences of unitary operations that engineer desired effective Hamiltonians in the time-domain. The result is a hybrid programmable analog simulator permitting a broad class of interacting spin-lattice models to be generated starting only with an arbitrary long-range native inter-particle interaction and single-qubit addressing. Specifically, our approach permits the generation of all symmetrically coupled translation-invariant two-body Hamiltonians with homogeneous on-site terms, a class which includes all spin-1/2 XYZ chains, but generalized to include long-range couplings. Building on previous work proving that universal simulation is possible using both entangling gates and single-qubit unitaries, we show that determining the ""program"" of unitary pulses to implement an arbitrary spin Hamiltonian can be formulated as a linear program that runs in polynomial time and scales efficiently in hardware resources. Our analysis extends from circuit model quantum information to adiabatic quantum evolutions, where our approach allows for the creation of non-native ground state solutions to a computation."
1698,1309.2006,2013,10,9,11,Separability from Spectrum for Qubit-Qudit States,Nathaniel Johnston,"The separability from spectrum problem asks for a characterization of the eigenvalues of the bipartite mixed states \rho with the property that U^*\rhoU is separable for all unitary matrices U. This problem has been solved when the local dimensions m and n satisfy m = 2 and n <= 3. We solve all remaining qubit-qudit cases (i.e., when m = 2 and n >= 4 is arbitrary). In all of these cases we show that a state is separable from spectrum if and only if U^*\rhoU has positive partial transpose for all unitary matrices U. This equivalence is in stark contrast with the usual separability problem, where a state having positive partial transpose is a strictly weaker property than it being separable."
1699,1309.1443,2013,10,1,11,Adiabatic graph-state quantum computation,Bobby Antonio;Damian Markham;Janet Anders,"Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation (HQC) are two very different computational methods. The computation in MBQC is driven by adaptive measurements executed in a particular order on a large entangled state. In contrast in HQC the system starts in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian which is slowly changed such that a transformation occurs within the subspace. Following the approach of Bacon and Flammia, we show that any measurement-based quantum computation on a graph state with \emphgflow can be converted into an adiabatically driven holonomic computation, which we call \emphadiabatic graph-state quantum computation (AGQC). We then investigate how properties of AGQC relate to the properties of MBQC, such as computational depth. We identify a trade-off that can be made between the number of adiabatic steps in AGQC and the norm of $\dot{H}$ as well as the degree of $H$, in analogy to the trade-off between the number of measurements and classical post-processing seen in MBQC. Finally the effects of performing AGQC with orderings that differ from standard MBQC are investigated."
1700,1307.8190,2013,9,27,11,Error corrected quantum annealing with hundreds of qubits,Kristen L Pudenz;Tameem Albash;Daniel A Lidar,"Quantum information processing offers dramatic speedups, yet is famously susceptible to decoherence, the process whereby quantum superpositions decay into mutually exclusive classical alternatives, thus robbing quantum computers of their power. This has made the development of quantum error correction an essential and inescapable aspect of both theoretical and experimental quantum computing. So far little is known about protection against decoherence in the context of quantum annealing, a computational paradigm which aims to exploit ground state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than is possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing and provide an experimental demonstration using up to 344 superconducting flux qubits in processors which have recently been shown to physically implement programmable quantum annealing. We demonstrate a substantial improvement over the performance of the processors in the absence of error correction. These results pave a path toward large scale noise-protected adiabatic quantum optimization devices."
1701,1307.7763,2013,9,10,11,Twisted Injectivity in PEPS and the Classification of Quantum Phases,Oliver Buerschaper,"We introduce a class of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) which is based on a group symmetry twisted by a 3-cocycle of the group. This twisted symmetry gives rise to a new standard form for PEPS from which we construct a family of local Hamiltonians which are gapped, frustration-free and include fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Moreover, we advance the classification of 2D gapped quantum spin systems by showing how this new standard form for PEPS determines the emergent topological order of these local Hamiltonians. Specifically, we identify their universality class as Dijkgraaf-Witten topological quantum field theory (TQFT)."
1702,1307.4993,2013,9,6,11,On the gap of Hamiltonians for the adiabatic simulation of quantum circuits,Anand Ganti;Rolando D Somma,"The time or cost of simulating a quantum circuit by adiabatic evolution is determined by the spectral gap of the Hamiltonians involved in the simulation. In ""standard"" constructions based on Feynman's Hamiltonian, such a gap decreases polynomially with the number of gates in the circuit, L. Because a larger gap implies a smaller cost, we study the limits of spectral gap amplification in this context. We show that, under some assumptions on the ground states and the cost of evolving with the Hamiltonians (which apply to the standard constructions), an upper bound on the gap of order 1/L follows. In addition, if the Hamiltonians satisfy a frustration-free property, the upper bound is of order 1/L^2. Our proofs use recent results on adiabatic state transformations, spectral gap amplification, and the simulation of continuous-time quantum query algorithms. They also consider a reduction from the unstructured search problem, whose lower bound in the oracle cost translates into the upper bounds in the gaps. The impact of our results is that improving the gap beyond that of standard constructions (i.e., 1/L^2), if possible, is challenging."

1704,1307.3232,2013,7,31,11,Small sets of locally indistinguishable orthogonal maximally entangled states,Alessandro Cosentino;Vincent Russo,"We study the problem of distinguishing quantum states using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). A question of fundamental interest is whether there exist sets of $k \leq d$ orthogonal maximally entangled states in $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$ that are not perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. A recent result by Yu, Duan, and Ying [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 020506 (2012) -- arXiv:1107.3224 [quant-ph]] gives an affirmative answer for the case $k = d$. We give, for the first time, a proof that such sets of states indeed exist even in the case $k < d$. Our result is constructive and holds for an even wider class of operations known as positive-partial-transpose measurements (PPT). The proof uses the characterization of the PPT-distinguishability problem as a semidefinite program."
1705,1307.2747,2013,7,19,11,Impossibility of Local State Transformation via Hypercontractivity,Payam Delgosha;Salman Beigi,"Local state transformation is the problem of transforming an arbitrary number of copies of a bipartite resource state to a bipartite target state under local operations. That is, given two bipartite states, is it possible to transform an arbitrary number of copies of one of them to one copy of the other state under local operations only? This problem is a hard one in general since we assume that the number of copies of the resource state is arbitrarily large. In this paper we prove some bounds on this problem using the hypercontractivity properties of some super-operators corresponding to bipartite states. We measure hypercontractivity in terms of both the usual super-operator norms as well as completely bounded norms."

The focus of the notes is on tensor network states, in particular Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), which provide an efficient description of many-body states based on their entanglement structure; both numerical and analytical aspects of tensor networks are being covered. The notes close with a brief introduction to quantum complexity, which allows to assess the limitations to our ability to simulate quantum many-body systems."

The result follows from a direct application of the techniques used by Bansal, Bravyi and Terhal who gave a PTAS for the same problem on planar and, in particular, grid graphs. We also show that on Chimera graphs, the trivial lower bound is within a constant factor of the optimum."
1708,1306.1565,2013,7,11,11,Proof of Heisenberg's error-disturbance relation,Paul Busch;Pekka Lahti;Reinhard F Werner,"While the slogan ""no measurement without disturbance"" has established itself under the name Heisenberg effect in the consciousness of the scientifically interested public, a precise statement of this fundamental feature of the quantum world has remained elusive, and serious attempts at rigorous formulations of it as a consequence of quantum theory have led to seemingly conflicting preliminary results. Here we show that despite recent claims to the contrary [Rozema et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 100404 (2012)], Heisenberg-type inequalities can be proven that describe a trade-off between the precision of a position measurement and the necessary resulting disturbance of momentum (and vice versa). More generally, these inequalities are instances of an uncertainty relation for the imprecisions of any joint measurement of position and momentum. Measures of error and disturbance are here defined as figures of merit characteristic of measuring devices. As such they are state independent, each giving worst-case estimates across all states, in contrast to previous work that is concerned with the relationship between error and disturbance in an individual state."
1709,1306.1259,2013,6,25,11,The computational complexity of density functional theory,James Daniel Whitfield;Norbert Schuch;Frank Verstraete,"Density functional theory is a successful branch of numerical simulations of quantum systems. While the foundations are rigorously defined, the universal functional must be approximated resulting in a `semi'-ab initio approach. The search for improved functionals has resulted in hundreds of functionals and remains an active research area. This chapter is concerned with understanding fundamental limitations of any algorithmic approach to approximating the universal functional. The results based on Hamiltonian complexity presented here are largely based on \citeSchuch09. In this chapter, we explain the computational complexity of DFT and any other approach to solving electronic structure Hamiltonians. The proof relies on perturbative gadgets widely used in Hamiltonian complexity and we provide an introduction to these techniques using the Schrieffer-Wolff method. Since the difficulty of this problem has been well appreciated before this formalization, practitioners have turned to a host approximate Hamiltonians. By extending the results of \citeSchuch09, we show in DFT, although the introduction of an approximate potential leads to a non-interacting Hamiltonian, it remains, in the worst case, an NP-complete problem."
1710,1306.0540,2013,6,21,11,Stability of topologically-protected quantum computing proposals as seen through spin glasses,Helmut G Katzgraber;Ruben S Andrist,"Sensitivity to noise makes most of the current quantum computing schemes prone to error and nonscalable, allowing only for small proof-of-principle devices. Topologically-protected quantum computing aims at solving this problem by encoding quantum bits and gates in topological properties of the hardware medium that are immune to noise that does not impact the entire system at once. There are different approaches to achieve topological stability or active error correction, ranging from quasiparticle braidings to spin models and topological color codes. The stability of these proposals against noise can be quantified by their error threshold. This figure of merit can be computed by mapping the problem onto complex statistical-mechanical spin-glass models with local disorder on nontrival lattices that can have many-body interactions and are sometimes described by lattice gauge theories. The error threshold for a given source of error then represents the point in the temperature-disorder phase diagram where a stable symmetry-broken phase vanishes. An overview of the techniques used to estimate the error thresholds is given, as well as a summary of recent results on the stability of different topologically-protected quantum computing schemes to different error sources."

We show that if one allows for a classical post-processing step only extremal rank-1 POVMs are needed. For a measurement with $N$ elements on a $d$-dimensional space, our algorithm will decompose it into at most $(N-1)d+1$ extremals, whereas the best previously known upper bound scaled as $d^2$. Since the decomposition is not unique, we show how to tailor our algorithm to provide particular types of decompositions that exhibit some desired property."

We focus on the case of systems with translation invariance in the thermodynamic limit, where momentum is a well defined quantum number.

Furthermore, in the last years Shannon's theory has been generalized to the quantum setting to let the \emphquantum information theory step in. In this paper we consider the classical capacity of quantum channels with restricted assisted entanglement. In particular these capacities include the classical capacity and the unlimited entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel. To deal with the quantum case we will use the noncommutative version of $p$-summing maps. More precisely, we prove that the (product state) classical capacity of a quantum channel with restricted assisted entanglement can be expressed as the derivative of a completely $p$-summing norm."
1715,1305.0257,2013,5,9,11,Non-Positive Partial Transpose Subspaces Can be as Large as Any Entangled Subspace,Nathaniel Johnston,"It is known that, in an $(m \otimes n)$-dimensional quantum system, the maximum dimension of a subspace that contains only entangled states is (m-1)(n-1). We show that the exact same bound is tight if we require the stronger condition that every state with range in the subspace has non-positive partial transpose. As an immediate corollary of our result, we solve an open question that asks for the maximum number of negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of a quantum state. In particular, we give an explicit method of construction of a bipartite state whose partial transpose has (m-1)(n-1) negative eigenvalues, which is necessarily maximal, despite recent numerical evidence that suggested such states may not exist for large m and n."

Rather, we provide an explicit algorithm for estimating parameters of physical models given access to a simulator which is only capable of producing sample outcomes. Since our algorithm does not require that a simulator be able to efficiently compute exact probabilities, it is able to exponentially outperform standard algorithms based on exact computation. In this way, our algorithm opens the door for the application of new insights and resources to the problem of characterizing large quantum systems, which is exponentially intractable using standard simulation resources."

We obtain a one-shot characterization of the minimum qubit compression size for an entanglement-assisted quantum rate-distortion code in terms of the smooth max-information, a quantity previously employed in the one-shot quantum reverse Shannon theorem. Next, we show how this characterization converges to the known expression for the entanglement-assisted quantum rate distortion function for asymptotically many copies of a memoryless quantum information source. Finally, we give a tight, finite blocklength characterization for the entanglement-assisted minimum qubit compression size of a memoryless isotropic qubit source subject to an average symbol-wise distortion constraint."

In our work, we provide an in-depth analysis of a simple question: What happens when we perform two measurements sequentially on the same quantum system? This question touches upon some fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, namely the uncertainty principle and the complementarity of quantum measurements. Our results have interesting consequences, for example they can provide a simple proof of the optimal quantum strategy in the famous Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt game. Moreover, we show that the way information is encoded in quantum systems can provide a different perspective in understanding other fundamental aspects of quantum information, like non-locality and quantum cryptography. We prove some strong equivalences between these notions and provide a number of applications in all areas."

It has lead to the recognition that Bell tests have their own place in applied quantum technologies, because they quantify non-classicality in a device-independent way, that is, without any need to describe the degrees of freedom under study and the measurements that are performed. At the more fundamental level, the same device-independent outlook has allowed the falsification of several other alternative models that could hope to reproduce the observed statistics while keeping some classical features that quantum theory denies; and it has shed new light on the long-standing quest for deriving quantum theory from physical principles."
1720,1303.1202,2013,4,9,11,On Metaplectic Modular Categories and their applications,Matthew B Hastings;Chetan Nayak;Zhenghan Wang,"For non-abelian simple objects in a unitary modular category, the density of their braid group representations, the #P-hard evaluation of their associated link invariants, and the BQP-completeness of their anyonic quantum computing models are closely related. We systematically study such properties of the non-abelian simple objects in metaplectic modular categories, which are unitary modular categories with fusion rules of SO(m)_2 for an odd integer m ≥3. The simple objects with quantum dimensions \sqrtm have finite image braid group representations, and their link invariants are classically efficient to evaluate. We also provide classically efficient simulation of their braid group representations. These simulations of the braid group representations can be regarded as qudit generalizations of the Knill-Gottesmann theorem for the qubit case. The simple objects of dimension 2 give us a surprising result: while their braid group representations have finite images and are efficiently simulable classically after a generalized localization, their link invariants are #P-hard to evaluate exactly. We sharpen the #P-hardness by showing that any sufficiently accurate approximation of their associated link invariants is already #P-hard."

We apply it to give a quantum walk algorithm for 3-Distinctness with query complexity ~O(n^5/7), matching the best known upper bound (obtained via learning graphs) up to log factors. Furthermore, our algorithm has time complexity ~O(n^5/7), improving the previous ~O(n^3/4)."
1722,1302.5281,2013,3,14,11,Fundamental bound on the reliability of quantum information transmission,Naresh Sharma;Naqueeb Ahmad Warsi,"Information theory tells us that if the rate of sending information across a noisy channel were above the capacity of that channel, then the transmission would necessarily be unreliable. For classical information sent over classical or quantum channels, one could, under certain conditions, make a stronger statement that the reliability of the transmission shall decay exponentially to zero with the number of channel uses and the proof of this statement typically relies on a certain fundamental bound on the reliability of the transmission. Such a statement or the bound has never been given for sending quantum information. We give this bound and then use it to give the first example where the reliability of sending quantum information at rates above the capacity decays exponentially to zero. We also show that our framework can be used for proving generalized bounds on the reliability."
1723,1302.3240,2013,3,7,11,Complex instruction set computing architecture for performing accurate quantum $Z$ rotations with less magic,Andrew J Landahl;Chris Cesare,"We present quantum protocols for executing arbitrarily accurate $\pi/2^k$ rotations of a qubit about its $Z$ axis. Reduced instruction set computing (\textscrisc) architectures typically restrict the instruction set to stabilizer operations and a single non-stabilizer operation, such as preparation of a ""magic"" state from which $T = Z(\pi/4)$ gates can be teleported. Although the overhead required to distill high-fidelity copies of this magic state is high, the subsequent quantum compiling overhead to realize $Z$ rotations in a \textscrisc architecture can be much greater. We develop a complex instruction set computing (\textsccisc) architecture whose instruction set includes stabilizer operations and preparation of magic states from which $Z(\pi/2^k)$ gates can be teleported, for $2 \leq k \leq k_{\text{max}}$. This results in a substantial overall reduction in the number of gates required to achieve a desired gate accuracy for $Z$ rotations. The key to our construction is a family of shortened quantum Reed-Muller codes of length $2^{k+2}-1$, whose magic-state distillation threshold shrinks with $k$ but is greater than 0.85% for $k \leq 6$."

Here, $W$ is the total weight of the graph, and $R$ is the effective resistance. This generalizes the result by Szegedy that is only applicable if the initial distribution is stationary. We describe a time-efficient quantum algorithm for 3-distinctness based on these ideas."
1725,1301.1594,2013,2,22,11,Identifying the Information Gain of a Quantum Measurement,Mario Berta;Joseph M Renes;Mark M Wilde,"We show that quantum-to-classical channels, i.e., quantum measurements, can be asymptotically simulated by an amount of classical communication equal to the quantum mutual information of the measurement, if sufficient shared randomness is available. This result generalizes Winter's measurement compression theorem for fixed independent and identically distributed inputs [Winter, CMP 244 (157), 2004] to arbitrary inputs, and more importantly, it identifies the quantum mutual information of a measurement as the information gained by performing it, independent of the input state on which it is performed. Our result is a generalization of the classical reverse Shannon theorem to quantum-to-classical channels. In this sense, it can be seen as a quantum reverse Shannon theorem for quantum-to-classical channels, but with the entanglement assistance and quantum communication replaced by shared randomness and classical communication, respectively. The proof is based on a novel one-shot state merging protocol for ""classically coherent states"" as well as the post-selection technique for quantum channels, and it uses techniques developed for the quantum reverse Shannon theorem [Berta et al., CMP 306 (579), 2011]."

However, intermediate quantum computational models have been proposed that are not universal, but can solve problems that are strongly believed to be classically hard. Aaronson and Arkhipov have shown that interference of single photons in random optical networks can solve the hard problem of sampling the bosonic output distribution which is directly connected to computing matrix permanents. Remarkably, this computation does not require measurement-based interactions or adaptive feed-forward techniques. Here we demonstrate this model of computation using high--quality laser--written integrated quantum networks that were designed to implement random unitary matrix transformations. We experimentally characterize the integrated devices using an in--situ reconstruction method and observe three-photon interference that leads to the boson-sampling output distribution. Our results set a benchmark for quantum computers, that hold the potential of outperforming conventional ones using only a few dozen photons and linear-optical elements."

The thesis would be directly contradicted by a physical device that efficiently performs a task believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is BosonSampling: obtaining a distribution of n bosons scattered by some linear-optical unitary process. Here we test the central premise of BosonSampling, experimentally verifying that the amplitudes of 3-photon scattering processes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a 6-mode integrated optical circuit. We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection. Strong evidence against the Extended Church-Turing thesis will come from scaling to large numbers of photons, which is a much simpler task than building a universal quantum computer."
1728,1212.0248,2012,1,9,11,The structure of Renyi entropic inequalities,Noah Linden;Milán Mosonyi;Andreas Winter,"We investigate the universal inequalities relating the alpha-Renyi entropies of the marginals of a multi-partite quantum state. This is in analogy to the same question for the Shannon and von Neumann entropy (alpha=1) which are known to satisfy several non-trivial inequalities such as strong subadditivity. Somewhat surprisingly, we find for 0<alpha<1, that the only inequality is non-negativity: In other words, any collection of non-negative numbers assigned to the nonempty subsets of n parties can be arbitrarily well approximated by the alpha-entropies of the 2^n-1 marginals of a quantum state. For alpha>1 we show analogously that there are no non-trivial homogeneous (in particular no linear) inequalities. On the other hand, it is known that there are further, non-linear and indeed non-homogeneous, inequalities delimiting the alpha-entropies of a general quantum state. Finally, we also treat the case of Renyi entropies restricted to classical states (i.e. probability distributions), which in addition to non-negativity are also subject to monotonicity. For alpha different from 0 and 1 we show that this is the only other homogeneous relation."

We give some additional examples in both settings. Furthermore, we observe that the equality conditions for all the new inequalities are essentially the same as those for strong subadditivity."

We examine a class of protocols that only require the communication of a single qubit and 2n bits of classical information. To this end, we define a new model of communication complexity, the garden-hose model, which enables us to prove upper bounds on the number of EPR pairs needed to attack such schemes. This model furthermore opens up a way to link the security of position-based quantum cryptography to traditional complexity theory."
1731,1210.3003,2012,12,4,11,Recovering the Period in Shor's Algorithm with Gauss' Algorithm for Lattice Basis Reduction,Allison Koenecke;Pawel Wocjan,"Shor's algorithm contains a classical post-processing part for which we aim to create an efficient, understandable method aside from continued fractions. Let r be an unknown positive integer. Assume that with some constant probability we obtain random positive integers of the form x=[ N k/r ] where [.] is either the floor or ceiling of the rational number, k is selected uniformly at random from 0,1,...,r-1, and N is a parameter that can be chosen. The problem of recovering r from such samples occurs precisely in the classical post-processing part of Shor's algorithm. The quantum part (quantum phase estimation) makes it possible to obtain such samples where r is the order of some element a of the unit group of Z_n and n is the number to be factored. Shor showed that the continued fraction algorithm can be used to efficiently recover r, since if N>2r^2 then k/r appears in lowest terms as one of the convergents of x/N due to a standard result on continued fractions. We present here an alternative method for recovering r based on the Gauss algorithm for lattice basis reduction, allowing us to efficiently find the shortest nonzero vector of a lattice generated by two vectors. Our method is about as efficient as the method based on continued fractions, yet it is much easier to understand all the details of why it works."

Our efficient simulation extends the continuous variable Gottesman-Knill theorem to a large class of non-Gaussian mixed states, thereby identifying that these non-Gaussian states are not an enabling resource for exponential quantum speed-up. Our results also provide an operationally motivated interpretation of negativity as non-classicality. We apply our scheme to the case of noisy single-photon-added-thermal-states to show that this class admits states with positive Wigner function but negative P -function that are not useful resource states for quantum computation."
1733,1210.1290,2012,10,17,11,Stronger Methods of Making Quantum Interactive Proofs Perfectly Complete,Hirotada Kobayashi;François Le Gall;Harumichi Nishimura,"This paper presents stronger methods of achieving perfect completeness in quantum interactive proofs. First, it is proved that any problem in QMA has a two-message quantum interactive proof system of perfect completeness with constant soundness error, where the verifier has only to send a constant number of halves of EPR pairs. This in particular implies that the class QMA is necessarily included by the class QIP_1(2) of problems having two-message quantum interactive proofs of perfect completeness, which gives the first nontrivial upper bound for QMA in terms of quantum interactive proofs. It is also proved that any problem having an $m$-message quantum interactive proof system necessarily has an $(m+1)$-message quantum interactive proof system of perfect completeness. This improves the previous result due to Kitaev and Watrous, where the resulting system of perfect completeness requires $m+2$ messages if not using the parallelization result."

Assuming independent noise, we find the optimal block size in terms of the bit-flip error probability p_X and the phase error probability p_Z, and determine how the probability of a logical error depends on p_X and p_Z. We show that a single Bacon-Shor code block, used by itself without concatenation, can provide very effective protection against logical errors if the noise is highly biased (p_Z / p_X >> 1) and the physical error rate p_Z is a few percent or below. We also derive an upper bound on the logical error rate for the case where the syndrome data is noisy."

Undoubtedly the best-known example of this is Shor's discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring integers, whereas the same problem appears to be intractable on classical computers. Understanding what other computational problems can be solved significantly faster using quantum algorithms is one of the major challenges in the theory of quantum computation, and such algorithms motivate the formidable task of building a large-scale quantum computer. This article will review the current state of quantum algorithms, focusing on algorithms for problems with an algebraic flavor that achieve an apparent superpolynomial speedup over classical computation."

Here we report on data from a second Bell experiment using the same experimental setup with minor modifications. We find a violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality of $2.35 \pm 0.18$, in agreement with the first run, yielding an overall value of $S = 2.38 \pm 0.14$. We calculate the resulting $P$-values of the second experiment and of the combined Bell tests. We provide an additional analysis of the distribution of settings choices recorded during the two tests, finding that the observed distributions are consistent with uniform settings for both tests. Finally, we analytically study the effect of particular models of random number generator (RNG) imperfection on our hypothesis test. We find that the winning probability per trial in the CHSH game can be bounded knowing only the mean of the RNG bias, implying that our experimental result is robust for any model underlying the estimated average RNG bias."
1737,1306.3991,2013,9,5,10,Efficient Quantum Circuits for Diagonal Unitaries Without Ancillas,Jonathan Welch;Daniel Greenbaum;Sarah Mostame;Alán Aspuru-Guzik,"The accurate evaluation of diagonal unitary operators is often the most resource-intensive element of quantum algorithms such as real-space quantum simulation and Grover search. Efficient circuits have been demonstrated in some cases but generally require ancilla registers, which can dominate the qubit resources. In this paper, we point out a correspondence between Walsh functions and a basis for diagonal operators that gives a simple way to construct efficient circuits for diagonal unitaries without ancillas. This correspondence reduces the problem of constructing the minimal-depth circuit within a given error tolerance, for an arbitrary diagonal unitary $e^{if(\hat{x})}$ in the $|x>$ basis, to that of finding the minimal-length Walsh-series approximation to the function $f(x)$. We apply this approach to the quantum simulation of the classical Eckart barrier problem of quantum chemistry, demonstrating that high-fidelity quantum simulations can be achieved with few qubits and low depth."
1738,1404.5153,2014,6,28,10,Optimal bounds for parity-oblivious random access codes,André Chailloux;Iordanis Kerenidis;Srijita Kundu;Jamie Sikora,"Random access coding is an information task that has been extensively studied and found many applications in quantum information. In this scenario, Alice receives an $n$-bit string $x$, and wishes to encode $x$ into a quantum state $\rho_x$, such that Bob, when receiving the state $\rho_x$, can choose any bit $i \in [n]$ and recover the input bit $x_i$ with high probability. Here we study two variants: parity-oblivious random access codes, where we impose the cryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity of any subset of bits of the input apart from the single bits $x_i$; and even-parity-oblivious random access codes, where Bob cannot infer any information about the parity of any even-size subset of bits of the input. In this paper, we provide the optimal bounds for parity-oblivious quantum random access codes and show that they are asymptotically better than the optimal classical ones. Our results provide a large non-contextuality inequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens, Buzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009). Second, we provide the optimal bounds for even-parity-oblivious random access codes by proving their equivalence to a non-local game and by providing tight bounds for the success probability of the non-local game via semidefinite programming. In the case of even-parity-oblivious random access codes, the cryptographic property holds also in the device-independent model."

In the field of communication complexity, quantum communication allows the advantage of an exponential reduction in the information transmitted over classical communication to accomplish distributed computational tasks. However, to date, demonstrating this advantage in a practical setting continues to be a central challenge. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a quantum fingerprinting protocol that for the first time surpasses the ultimate classical limit to transmitted information. Ultra-low noise superconducting single-photon detectors and a stable fibre-based Sagnac interferometer are used to implement a quantum fingerprinting system that is capable of transmitting less information than the classical proven lower bound over 20 km standard telecom fibre for input sizes of up to two Gbits. The results pave the way for experimentally exploring the advanced features of quantum communication and open a new window of opportunity for research in communication complexity and testing the foundations of physics."

I argue that time is much richer. In particular, I argue that besides the geometric time, there is creative time, when objective chance events happen. The existence of the latter follows straight from the existence of free-will. Following the french philosopher Lequyer, I argue that free-will is a prerequisite for the possibility to have rational argumentations, hence can't be denied.

An important step in the construction of these limited quantum computational devices is the understanding of whether the verification of the computation within these models could be also performed in the restricted scheme. Encoding via blindness (a cryptographic protocol for delegated computing) has proven successful for the verification of universal quantum computation with a restricted verifier. In this paper, we present the adaptation of this approach to the one pure qubit model, and present the first feasible scheme for the verification of delegated one pure qubit model of quantum computing."
1742,1310.7525,2013,3,8,10,Coding theorems for compound problems via quantum Rényi divergences,Milán Mosonyi,"Recently, a new notion of quantum Rényi divergences has been introduced by Müller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J.Math.Phys. 54:122203, (2013), and Wilde, Winter, Yang, Commun.Math.Phys. 331:593--622, (2014), that has found a number of applications in strong converse theorems. Here we show that these new Rényi divergences are also useful tools to obtain coding theorems in the direct domain of various problems. We demonstrate this by giving new and considerably simplified proofs for the achievability parts of Stein's lemma with composite null hypothesis, universal state compression, and the classical capacity of compound classical-quantum channels, based on single-shot error bounds already available in the literature, and simple properties of the quantum Rényi divergences. The novelty of our proofs is that the composite/compound coding theorems can be almost directly obtained from the single-shot error bounds, with essentially the same effort as for the case of simple null-hypothesis/single source/single channel."

Our main technical contribution is a tool for studying the action of consecutive measurements on a quantum state which in turn gives upper bounds on the value of some entangled games. This allows us to prove the security of our protocol against quantum adversaries. We also prove security bounds for the (single-round) relativistic string commitment and bit commitment in parallel against quantum adversaries. As an additional consequence of our result, we answer an open question from [Unr12] and show tight bounds on the quantum knowledge error of some $\Sigma$-protocols."

It combines heralded gates previously studied for atom or atom-like qubits with logical encoding from linear optical quantum computation in order to perform high fidelity quantum gates across a quantum network. The error-detecting properties of the heralded operations ensure high fidelity while the encoding makes it possible to correct for failed attempts such that deterministic and high-quality gates can be achieved. Importantly, this is robust to photon loss, which is typically the main obstacle to photonic based quantum information processing. Overall this approach opens a novel path towards quantum networks with atomic nodes and photonic links."

This paper devises a quantum algorithm that exactly solves the problem on an anonymous network, which is known as a network model with minimal assumptions [Angluin, STOC'80]. The algorithm runs in $O(N)$ rounds if every party initially has the common knowledge of an upper bound $N$ on the number of parties. This implies that all solvable problems can be solved in $O(N)$ rounds on average without error (i.e., with zero-sided error) on the network. As a generalization, a quantum algorithm that works in $O(N\log_2 (\max\{k,2\}))$ rounds is obtained for the problem of exactly computing any symmetric Boolean function, over $n$ distributed input bits, which is constant over all the $n$ bits whose sum is larger than $k$ for $k\in \{0,1,\dots, N-1\}$. All these algorithms work with the bit complexities bounded by a polynomial in $N$."

Here we show that the phase of these drives can be used to generate zero-duration arbitrary Z-gates which, combined with two $X_{\pi/2}$ gates, can generate any SU(2) gate. We perform randomized benchmarking using a Clifford set of Hadamard and Z-gates and show that the error per Clifford is reduced versus a set consisting of standard finite-duration X and Y gates. Z-gates can also correct unitary rotation errors for weakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse shaping techniques such as DRAG. We investigate leakage and show that a combination of DRAG pulse shaping to minimize leakage and Z-gates to correct rotation errors (DRAGZ) realizes a 13.3ns $X_{\pi/2}$ gate characterized by low error ($1.95[3]\times 10^{-4}$) and low leakage ($3.1[6]\times 10^{-6}$). Ultimately leakage is limited by the finite temperature of the qubit, but this limit is two orders-of-magnitude smaller than pulse errors due to decoherence."

The models are governed by a set of isometries that specify how microstates of the black hole at a given energy evolve to entangled states of a tensor product black-hole/radiation Hilbert space. The final state of the black hole radiation is conveniently summarized by a tensor network built from these isometries. We introduce a set of quantities generalizing the Renyi entropies that provide a complete set of bipartite/multipartite entanglement measures, and give a general formula for the average of these over initial black hole states in terms of the isometries defining the model. For models where the dimension of the final tensor product radiation Hilbert space is the same as that of the space of initial black hole microstates, the entanglement structure is universal, independent of the choice of isometries. In the more general case, we find that models which best capture the ""information-free"" property of black hole horizons are those whose isometries are tensors corresponding to states of tripartite systems with maximally mixed subsystems."

Then distance verification is addressed for classical and quantum LDPC codes. New complexity bounds for distance verification with provable performance are derived using the average weight spectra of the ensembles of LDPC codes. These bounds are expressed in terms of the erasure-correcting capacity of the corresponding ensemble. We also present a new irreducible-cluster technique that can be applied to any LDPC code and takes advantage of parity-checks' sparsity for both classical and quantum LDPC codes. This technique reduces complexity exponents of all existing deterministic techniques designed for generic stabilizer codes with small relative distances, which also include all known families of quantum LDPC codes."

Both have a wider range of validity than the Lindblad equation investigated by Davies. For low temperatures, they do not require coupling to be exponentially weak in the system size.

Based on this, we obtain improved SDP finite blocklength converse bounds for general quantum channels, which also reduce to the converse bound of Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verdú for classical channels. Furthermore, we derive two SDP strong converse bounds for the classical capacity of a general quantum channel: for any code with a rate exceeding either of the two bounds of the channel, the success probability vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. In particular, applying our efficiently computable bounds, we derive improved upper bounds to the classical capacity of the class of amplitude damping channels. Remarkably, we also establish the strong converse property for the classical and private capacities of a new class of quantum channels. We finally study the zero-error setting and provide efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot zero-error capacity of a general quantum channel."
1751,1610.05657,2016,11,15,10,Structure of irreducibly covariant quantum channels,Marek Mozrzymas;Michał Studziński;Nilanjana Datta,"We obtain an explicit characterization of linear maps, in particular, quantum channels, which are covariant with respect to an irreducible representation ($U$) of a finite group ($G$), whenever $U \otimes U^c$ is simply reducible (with $U^c$ being the contragradient representation). Using the theory of group representations, we obtain the spectral decomposition of any such linear map. The eigenvalues and orthogonal projections arising in this decomposition are expressed entirely in terms of representation characteristics of the group $G$. This in turn yields necessary and sufficient conditions on the eigenvalues of any such linear map for it to be a quantum channel. We also obtain a wide class of quantum channels which are irreducibly covariant by construction. For two-dimensional irrreducible representations of the symmetric group $S(3)$, and the quaternion group $Q$, we also characterize quantum channels which are both irreducibly covariant and entanglement breaking."
1752,1610.03682,2016,10,21,10,Fidelity as a figure of merit in quantum error correction,Jonas Almlöf;Gunnar Björk,"We discuss the fidelity as a figure of merit in quantum error correction schemes. We show that when identifiable but uncorrectable errors occur as a result of the action of the channel, a common strategy that improves the fidelity actually decreases the transmitted mutual information. The conclusion is that while the fidelity is simple to calculate and therefore often used, it is perhaps not always a recommendable figure of merit for quantum error correction. The reason is that while it roughly speaking encourages optimisation of the ""mean probability of success"", it gives no incentive for a protocol to indicate exactly where the errors lurk. For small error probabilities, the latter information is more important for the integrity of the information than optimising the mean probability of success."
1753,1610.03422,2016,10,19,10,Quantum authentication with key recycling,Christopher Portmann,"We show that a family of quantum authentication protocols introduced in [Barnum et al., FOCS 2002] can be used to construct a secure quantum channel and additionally recycle all of the secret key if the message is successfully authenticated, and recycle part of the key if tampering is detected. We give a full security proof that constructs the secure channel given only insecure noisy channels and a shared secret key. We also prove that the number of recycled key bits is optimal for this family of protocols, i.e., there exists an adversarial strategy to obtain all non-recycled bits. Previous works recycled less key and only gave partial security proofs, since they did not consider all possible distinguishers (environments) that may be used to distinguish the real setting from the ideal secure quantum channel."

The aims of this paper are threefold: to (i) give a brief but broad introduction to TNT, (ii) give an overview of the structure of TNT library, and (iii) describe in detail the core tensor features of the library."
1755,1610.00682,2016,10,12,10,Entanglement is an inevitable feature of any non-classical theory,Jonathan G Richens;John H Selby;Sabri W Al-Safi,"One of the most striking features of quantum theory is the existence of entangled states, responsible for Einstein's so called ""spooky action at a distance"". These states emerge from the mathematical formalism of quantum theory, but to date we do not have a clear idea of which physical principles give rise to entanglement. Why does quantum theory have entangled states? Would any theory superseding classical theory have entangled states, or is quantum theory special? We demonstrate that without entanglement, non-classical degrees of freedom cannot reversibly interact. We present two postulates, no-cloning / no-broadcasting and local transitivity, either of which are sufficient to imply the existence of entangled states in any non-classical theory with reversible interactions. Therefore we argue that entanglement is an inevitable feature of a non-classical universe."
1756,1609.09137,2016,10,10,10,Discrepancies between Asymptotic and Exact Spectral Gap Analyses of Quantum Adiabatic Barrier Tunneling,Lucas T Brady;Wim van Dam,"We study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap of simple barrier tunneling problems, which are related to using quantum annealing to find the global optimum of cost functions defined over n bits. Specifically we look at the problem of having an n qubit system tunnel through a barrier of width and height proportional to n^a. We show that with these quantum annealing problems, the asymptotic, $n\to\infty$, behavior of the spectral gap does not accurately describe the behavior of the gap at finite n until extremely large values of n (n>10^12). We prove that this deficiency of the asymptotic expression is a feature of simple one-dimensional tunneling problems themselves, casting doubt on whether asymptotic analysis is an appropriate tool for studying tunneling problems in quantum annealing for reasonably sized systems."
1757,1609.08584,2016,9,30,10,Asymmetric de Finetti Theorem for Infinite-dimensional Quantum Systems,Murphy Yuezhen Niu,"The de Finetti representation theorem for continuous variable quantum system is first developed to approximate an N-partite continuous variable quantum state with a convex combination of independent and identical subsystems, which requires the original state to obey permutation symmetry conditioned on successful experimental verification on k of N subsystems. We generalize the de Finetti theorem to include asymmetric bounds on the variance of canonical observables and biased basis selection during the verification step. Our result thereby enables application of infinite-dimensional de Finetti theorem to situations where two conjugate measurements obey different statistics, such as the security analysis of quantum key distribution protocols based on squeezed state against coherent attack."
1758,1609.03785,2016,9,28,10,Exponential Enhancement of the Efficiency of Quantum Annealing by Non-Stochastic Hamiltonians,Hidetoshi Nishimori;Kabuki Takada,"Non-stoquastic Hamiltonians have both positive and negative signs in off-diagonal elements in their matrix representation in the standard computational basis and thus cannot be simulated efficiently by the standard quantum Monte Carlo method due to the sign problem. We describe our analytical studies of this type of Hamiltonians with infinite-range non-random as well as random interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the efficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing. It is shown that non-stoquastic terms, of the type of multi-body transverse interactions like XX and XXX with positive coefficients, appended to the stoquastic Hamiltonian reduce a first-order quantum phase transition in the simple transverse-field Ising model to a second-order transition. This implies that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a first-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore exponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a polynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time). The examples presented here are the first instances where strong quantum effects, in the sense that they cannot be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum Monte Carlo, have analytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization problems."
1759,1608.04804,2016,9,14,10,Quanta and Qualia,Adrian Kent,"I sketch a line of thought about consciousness and physics that gives some motivation for the hypothesis that conscious observers deviate - perhaps only very subtly and slightly - from quantum dynamics. Although it is hard to know just how much credence to give this line of thought, it does motivate a stronger and more comprehensive programme of quantum experiments involving quantum observers."
1760,1607.06090,2016,8,18,10,Energy as a detector of nonlocality of many-body spin systems,Jordi Tura;Gemma De las Cuevas;Remigiusz Augusiak;Maciej Lewenstein;Antonio Acín;J Ignacio Cirac,"We present a method to show that the ground states of some quantum many-body spin Hamiltonians in one spatial dimension are nonlocal. We assign a Bell inequality to the given Hamiltonian in a natural way and we find its classical bound using dynamic programming. The Bell inequality is such that its quantum value corresponds to the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian, which we find it exactly by mapping the spin system to a quadratic system of fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The method can also be used from the opposite point of view; namely, as a new method to optimize certain Bell inequalities. In the translationally invariant (TI) case, we provide an exponentially faster solution of the classical bound and analytically closed expressions of the quantum value. We apply our method to three examples: a tight TI inequality for $8$ parties, a quasi TI uniparametric inequality for any even number of parties, and we show that the ground state of a spin glass is nonlocal in some parameter region. This opens the possibility for the use of ground states of commonly studied Hamiltonians as multipartite resources for quantum information protocols that require nonlocality."
1761,1607.05870,2016,7,22,10,Quantum logic is undecidable,Tobias Fritz,"We investigate the first-order theory of closed subspaces of complex Hilbert spaces in the signature $(\lor,\perp,0,1)$, where `$\perp$' is the orthogonality relation. Our main result is that already its purely implicational fragment is undecidable: there is no algorithm to decide whether an implication between equations in the language of orthomodular lattices is valid in all complex Hilbert spaces. This is a corollary of a recent result of Slofstra in combinatorial group theory. It follows upon reinterpreting that result in terms of the hypergraph approach to contextuality, for which it constitutes a proof of the inverse sandwich conjecture. It can also be interpreted as stating that a certain quantum satisfiability problem is undecidable."
1762,1607.05814,2016,7,21,10,Insecurity of detector-device-independent quantum key distribution,Shihan Sajeed;Anqi Huang;Shihai Sun;Feihu Xu;Vadim Makarov;Marcos Curty,"Detector-device-independent quantum key distribution (ddiQKD) held the promise of being robust to detector side-channels, a major security loophole in QKD implementations. In contrast to what has been claimed, however, we demonstrate that the security of ddiQKD is not based on post-selected entanglement, and we introduce various eavesdropping strategies that show that ddiQKD is in fact insecure against detector side-channel attacks as well as against other attacks that exploit device's imperfections of the receiver. Our attacks are valid even when the QKD apparatuses are built by the legitimate users of the system themselves, and thus free of malicious modifications, which is a key assumption in ddiQKD."
1763,1607.02991,2016,7,21,10,Complexity Theory and its Applications in Linear Quantum Optics,Jonathan P Olson,"This thesis is intended in part to summarize and also to contribute to the newest developments in passive linear optics that have resulted, directly or indirectly, from the somewhat shocking discovery in 2010 that the BosonSampling problem is likely hard for a classical computer to simulate. In doing so, I hope to provide a historic context for the original result, as well as an outlook on the future of technology derived from these newer developments. An emphasis is made in each section to provide a broader conceptual framework for understanding the consequences of each result in light of the others. This framework is intended to be comprehensible even without a deep understanding of the topics themselves. The first three chapters focus more closely on the BosonSampling result itself, seeking to understand the computational complexity aspects of passive linear optical networks, and what consequences this may have. Some effort is spent discussing a number of issues inherent in the BosonSampling problem that limit the scope of its applicability, and that are still active topics of research. Finally, we describe two other linear optical settings that inherit the same complexity as BosonSampling. The final chapters focus on how an intuitive understanding of BosonSampling has led to developments in optical metrology and other closely related fields. These developments suggest the exciting possibility that quantum sensors may be viable in the next few years with only marginal improvements in technology. Lastly, some open problems are presented which are intended to lay out a course for future research that would allow for a more complete picture of the scalability of the architecture developed in these chapters."

We prove that the ground state of our model is non-degenerate and exhibits a novel quantum phase transition from bounded entanglement entropy to a massively entangled state with volume entropy scaling. The ground state may be interpreted as a deformation away from the uniform superposition of colored Motzkin paths, showed by Movassagh and Shor to have a large (square-root) but sub-extensive scaling of entanglement into a state with an extensive entropy."
1765,1606.00446,2016,6,27,10,Measurement-Based Linear Optics,Rafael N Alexander;Natasha Gabay;Peter P Rohde;Nicolas C Menicucci,"A major challenge in optical quantum processing is implementing large, stable interferometers. Here we propose a virtual, measurement-based interferometer that is programmed on the fly solely by the choice of homodyne measurement angles. The effects of finite squeezing are captured as uniform amplitude damping. We compare our proposal to existing (physical) interferometers and consider its performance for BosonSampling, which could demonstrate post-classical computational power in the near future. We prove its efficiency in time and squeezing (energy) in this setting."
1766,1605.08177,2016,6,3,10,Quantum mechanics: The Bayesian theory generalised to the space of Hermitian matrices,Alessio Benavoli;Alessandro Facchini;Marco Zaffalon,"We consider the problem of gambling on a quantum experiment and enforce rational behaviour by a few rules. These rules yield, in the classical case, the Bayesian theory of probability via duality theorems. In our quantum setting, they yield the Bayesian theory generalised to the space of Hermitian matrices. This very theory is quantum mechanics: in fact, we derive all its four postulates from the generalised Bayesian theory. This implies that quantum mechanics is self-consistent. It also leads us to reinterpret the main operations in quantum mechanics as probability rules: Bayes' rule (measurement), marginalisation (partial tracing), independence (tensor product). To say it with a slogan, we obtain that quantum mechanics is the Bayesian theory in the complex numbers."
1767,1605.07541,2016,5,27,10,Inductive quantum learning: Why you are doing it almost right,Alex Monràs;Gael Sentís;Peter Wittek,"In supervised learning, an inductive learning algorithm extracts general rules from observed training instances, then the rules are applied to test instances. We show that this splitting of training and application arises naturally, in the classical setting, from a simple independence requirement with a physical interpretation of being non-signalling. Thus, two seemingly different definitions of inductive learning happen to coincide. This follows from very specific properties of classical information, which break down in the quantum setup. We prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for quantum channels, which shows that in the quantum case, the equivalence holds in the asymptotic setting (for large number of test instances). This reveals a natural analogy between classical learning protocols and their quantum counterparts, thus allowing to naturally enquire about standard elements in computational learning theory, such as structural risk minimization, model and sample complexity."
1768,1605.05709,2016,5,25,10,Performing Quantum Computing Experiments in the Cloud,Simon J Devitt,"Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past five years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined with extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this technology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many, the first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the cloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet. Recently IBM has released the \em Quantum Experience which allows users to access a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this online availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum information experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise the IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum Arithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by accessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject to significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This demonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a wider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in quantum information technology."
1769,1605.01828,2016,5,19,10,Two-sided Quantum Amplitude Amplification and Exact-Error Algorithms,Debajyoti Bera,"Amplitude amplification is a central tool used in Grover's quantum search algorithm and has been used in various forms in numerous quantum algorithms since then. It has been shown to completely eliminate one-sided error of quantum search algorithms where input is accessed in the form of black-box queries. We generalize amplitude amplification for two-sided error quantum algorithm for decision problems in the familiar form where input is accessed in the form of initial states of quantum circuits and where arbitrary projective measurements may be used to ascertain success or failure. This generalization allows us to derive interesting applications of amplitude amplification for distinguishing between two given distributions based on their samples, detection of faults in quantum circuits and eliminating error of one and two-sided quantum algorithms with exact errors."
1770,1604.08724,2016,5,9,10,Adaptive strategy for joint measurements,Roope Uola;Kimmo Luoma;Tobias Moroder;Teiko Heinosaari,We develop a technique to find simultaneous measurements for noisy quantum observables in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We use the method to derive lower bounds for the noise needed to make incompatible measurements jointly measurable. Using our strategy together with recent devel- opments in the field of one-sided quantum information processing we show that the attained lower bounds are tight for various symmetric sets of quantum measurements. We use this characterisation to prove the existence of so called 4-Specker sets in the qubit case.
1771,1604.05655,2016,5,2,10,Quantum computation and communication in strongly interacting systems,Bobby Antonio,"Each year, the gap between theoretical proposals and experimental endeavours to create quantum computers gets smaller, driven by the promise of fundamentally faster algorithms and quantum simulations. This occurs by the combination of experimental ingenuity and ever simpler theoretical schemes. This thesis comes from the latter perspective, aiming to find new, simpler ways in which components of a quantum computer could be built. We first search for ways to create quantum gates, the primitive building blocks of a quantum computer. We find a novel, low-control way of performing a two-qubit gate on qubits encoded in a decoherence-free subspace, making use of many-body interactions that may already be present. This includes an analysis of the effect of control errors and magnetic field fluctuations on the gate. We then present novel ways to create three-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates in a single step using linear arrays of qubits, including an assessment of how well these gates could perform, for quantum or classical computation, using state-of-the-art ion trap and silicon donor technology. We then focus on a very different model from the normal circuit model, combining ideas from measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation, showing that all MBQC patterns with a property called \emphgflow can be converted into a holonomic computation. The manifestation of the properties of MBQC in this adiabatically driven model is then explored. Finally, we investigate ways in which quantum information can be communicated between distant parties, using minimally engineered spin chains. The viability of using 1D Wigner crystals as a quantum channel is analysed, as well as schemes using ideal uniform spin chains with next-neighbour interactions, and edge-locking effects."
1772,1604.03749,2016,4,20,10,The thermodynamic cost of quantum operations,Daniel Bedingham;Owen J E Maroney,"The amount of heat generated by computers is rapidly becoming one of the main problems for developing new generations of information technology. The thermodynamics of computation sets the ultimate physical bounds on heat generation. A lower bound is set by the Landauer Limit, at which computation becomes thermodynamically reversible. For classical computation there is no physical principle which prevents this limit being reached, and approaches to it are already being experimentally tested. In this paper we show that for quantum computation there is an unavoidable excess heat generation that renders it inherently thermodynamically irreversible. The Landauer Limit cannot, in general, be reached by quantum computers. We show the existence of a lower bound to the heat generated by quantum computing that exceeds that given by the Landauer Limit, give the special conditions where this excess cost may be avoided, and show how classical computing falls within these special conditions."
1773,1604.02831,2016,4,14,10,Preservation of a quantum Renyi relative entropy implies existence of a recovery map,Anna Jencova,"It is known that a necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) for the quantum relative entropy is the existence of a recovery map. We show that equality in DPI for a sandwiched Rényi relative $\alpha$-entropy with $\alpha>1$ is also equivalent to this property. For the proof, we use an interpolating family of $L_p$-norms with respect to a state."
1774,1604.00775,2016,4,12,10,"Simultaneous Measurement of Two Quantum Observables: Compatibility, Broadcasting, and In-between",Teiko Heinosaari,"One of the central features of quantum theory is that there are pairs of quantum observables that cannot be measured simultaneously. This incompatibility of quantum observables is a necessary ingredient in several quantum phenomena, such as measurement uncertainty relations, violation of Bell inequalities and steering. Two quantum observables that admit a simultaneous measurement are, in this respect, classical. A finer classification of classicality can be made by formulating four symmetric relations on the set of observables that are stronger than compatibility; they are broadcastability, one-side broadcastability, mutual nondisturbance and nondisturbance. It is proven that the five relations form a hierarchy, and their differences in terms of the required devices needed in a simultaneous measurement is explained. All the four relations stronger than compatibility are completely characterized in the case of qubit observables."
1775,1603.07160,2016,4,5,10,Optimal amount of entanglement to distinguish quantum states instantaneously,Berry Groisman;Sergii Strelchuk,We introduce a new aspect of nonlocality which arises when the task of quantum states distinguishability is considered under local operations and shared entanglement in the absence of classical communication. We find the optimal amount of entanglement required to accomplish the task perfectly for sets of orthogonal states and argue that it quantifies information nonlocality.
1776,1603.05080,2016,3,24,10,EPR Steering inequalities with Communication Assistance,Sándor Nagy;Tamas Vértesi,"In this paper, we investigate the communication cost of reproducing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering correlations arising from bipartite quantum systems. We characterize the set of bipartite quantum states which admits a local hidden state model augmented with $c$ bits of classical communication from an untrusted party (Alice) to a trusted party (Bob). In case of one bit of information ($c=1$), we show that this set has a nontrivial intersection with the sets admitting a local hidden state and a local hidden variables model for projective measurements. On the other hand, we find that an infinite amount of classical communication is required from an untrusted Alice to a trusted Bob to simulate the EPR steering correlations produced by a two-qubit maximally entangled state. It is conjectured that a state-of-the-art quantum experiment would be able to falsify two bits of communication this way."

Here we discuss the possibility of simulating classically this effect, using classical communication instead of entanglement. We show that infinite communication is necessary for exactly simulating steering for any pure entangled state, as well as for a class of mixed entangled states. Moreover, we discuss the communication cost of steering for general entangled states, as well as approximate simulation. Our findings reveal striking differences between Bell nonlocality and steering, and provide a natural way of measuring the strength of the latter."

Distinguishing coherent and incoherent errors is extremely useful as they can be reduced in different ways. Coherent errors are generally easier to reduce at the hardware level, e.g. by improving calibration, whereas some sources of incoherent errors, e.g. T2* processes, can be reduced by engineering robust pulses. In this work, we illustrate how purity benchmarking and randomized benchmarking can be used together to distinguish between coherent and incoherent errors and to quantify the reduction in both of them due to using optimal control pulses and accounting for the transfer function in an electron spin resonance system. We also prove that purity benchmarking provides bounds on the optimal fidelity and diamond norm that can be achieved by correcting the coherent errors through improving calibration."
1779,1602.06261,2016,3,14,10,Dynamical decoupling sequences for multi-qubit dephasing suppression and long-time quantum memory,Gerardo A Paz-Silva;Seung-Woo Lee;Todd J Green;Lorenza Viola,"We consider a class of multi-qubit dephasing models that combine classical noise sources and linear coupling to a bosonic environment, and are controlled by arbitrary sequences of dynamical decoupling pulses. Building on a general transfer filter-function framework for open-loop control, we provide an exact representation of the controlled dynamics for arbitrary stationary non-Gaussian classical and quantum noise statistics, with analytical expressions emerging when all dephasing sources are Gaussian. This exact characterization is used to establish two main results. First, we construct multi-qubit sequences that ensure maximum high-order error suppression in both the time and frequency domain and that can be exponentially more efficient than existing ones in terms of total pulse number. Next, we show how long-time multi-qubit storage may be achieved by meeting appropriate conditions for the emergence of a fidelity plateau under sequence repetition, thereby generalizing recent results for single-qubit memory under Gaussian dephasing. In both scenarios, the key step is to endow multi-qubit sequences with a suitable displacement anti-symmetry property, which is of independent interest for applications ranging from environment-assisted entanglement generation to multi-qubit noise spectroscopy protocols."
1780,1602.05448,2016,2,22,10,Optimal measurements for nonlocal correlations,Sacha Schwarz;Andre Stefanov;Stefan Wolf;Alberto Montina,"A problem in quantum information theory is to find the experimental setup that maximizes the nonlocality of correlations with respect to some suitable measure such as the violation of Bell inequalities. The latter has however some drawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of Bell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find the experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation suffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the Bell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct information-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical communication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of many instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per instance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a convex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number of measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental setup. Focusing on the bipartite case, in this paper, we present a simple method for maximizing the nonlocal capacity over a given configuration space and, in particular, over a set of possible measurements, yielding the corresponding optimal setup. Furthermore, we show that there is a functional relationship between Bell violation and nonlocal capacity. The method is illustrated with numerical tests and compared with the maximization of the violation of CGLMP-type Bell inequalities on the basis of entangled two-qubit as well as two-qutrit states. Remarkably, the anomaly of nonlocality displayed by qutrits turns out to be even stronger if the nonlocal capacity is employed as a measure of nonlocality."

In the case of Ising non-Abelian anyons, twisted interferometry is shown to be able to generate a topologically protected $\pi/8$-phase gate, which cannot be generated from quasiparticle braiding."

We perform a number of single- and multi-node optimizations, including vectorization, multi-threading, cache blocking, as well as overlapping computation with communication. Using the TACC Stampede supercomputer, we simulate quantum circuits (""quantum software"") of up to 40 qubits. We carry out a detailed performance analysis to show that our simulator achieves both high performance and high hardware efficiency, limited only by the sustainable memory and network bandwidth of the machine."
1783,1601.04360,2016,1,28,10,On Participatory Realism,Christopher A Fuchs,"In the Philosophical Investigations, Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote, "" 'I' is not the name of a person, nor 'here' of a place, .... But they are connected with names. ... [And] it is characteristic of physics not to use these words."" This statement expresses the dominant way of thinking in physics: Physics is about the impersonal laws of nature; the ""I"" never makes an appearance in it. Since the advent of quantum theory, however, there has always been a nagging pressure to insert a first-person perspective into the heart of physics. In incarnations of lesser or greater strength, one may consider the ""Copenhagen"" views of Bohr, Heisenberg, and Pauli, the observer-participator view of John Wheeler, the informational interpretation of Anton Zeilinger and Caslav Brukner, the relational interpretation of Carlo Rovelli, and, most radically, the QBism of N. David Mermin, Ruediger Schack, and the present author, as acceding to the pressure. These views have lately been termed ""participatory realism"" to emphasize that rather than relinquishing the idea of reality (as they are often accused of), they are saying that reality is more than any third-person perspective can capture. Thus, far from instances of instrumentalism or antirealism, these views of quantum theory should be regarded as attempts to make a deep statement about the nature of reality. This paper explicates the idea for the case of QBism. As well, it highlights the influence of John Wheeler's ""law without law"" on QBism's formulation."
1784,1601.02544,2016,1,19,10,Spacetime replication of continuous variable quantum information,Patrick Hayden;Sepehr Nezami;Grant Salton;Barry C Sanders,"The theory of relativity requires that no information travel faster than light, whereas the unitarity of quantum mechanics ensures that quantum information cannot be cloned. These conditions provide the basic constraints that appear in information replication tasks, which formalize aspects of the behavior of information in relativistic quantum mechanics. In this article, we provide continuous variable (CV) strategies for spacetime quantum information replication that are directly amenable to optical or mechanical implementation. We use a new class of homologically-constructed CV quantum error correcting codes to provide efficient solutions for the general case of information replication. As compared to schemes encoding qubits, our CV solution requires half as many shares per encoded system. We also provide an optimized five-mode strategy for replicating quantum information in a particular configuration of four spacetime regions designed not to be reducible to previously performed experiments. For this optimized strategy, we provide detailed encoding and decoding procedures using standard optical apparatus and calculate the recovery fidelity when finite squeezing is used. As such we provide a scheme for experimentally realizing quantum information replication using quantum optics."
1785,1512.09047,2015,1,12,10,"Tight continuity bounds for the quantum conditional mutual information, for the Holevo quantity and for capacities of a channel",M E Shirokov,First we consider Fannes' type and Winter's type tight continuity bounds for the quantum conditional mutual information and their specifications for states of special types. Then we analyse continuity of the Holevo quantity with respect to two nonequivalent metrics on the set of discrete ensembles of quantum states. We show that the Holevo quantity is continuous on the set of all ensembles of m states with respect to both metrics if either m or the dimension of underlying Hilbert space is finite and obtain Fannes' type tight continuity bounds for the Holevo quantity in this case. Conditions for local continuity of the Holevo quantity for discrete and continuous ensembles are proved. Winter's type tight continuity bound for the Holevo quantity under the constraint on the average energy of ensembles is obtained and applied to the system of quantum oscillators. The above results are used to obtain tight and close-to-tight continuity bounds for basic capacities of finite-dimensional channels (refining the Leung-Smith continuity bounds) and for classical capacities of infinite-dimensional channels with energy constraints.

In discrete space, this is replaced by the discrete or graph Laplacian, which gives rise to a continuous-time quantum walk. Besides this natural definition, some quantum walk algorithms instead use the adjacency matrix to effect the walk. While this is equivalent to the Laplacian for regular graphs, it is different for non-regular graphs, and is thus an inequivalent quantum walk. We algorithmically explore this distinction by analyzing search on the complete bipartite graph with multiple marked vertices, using both the Laplacian and adjacency matrix. The two walks differ qualitatively and quantitatively in their required jumping rate, runtime, sampling of marked vertices, and in what constitutes a natural initial state. Thus the choice of the Laplacian or adjacency matrix to effect the walk has important algorithmic consequences."
1787,1511.08819,2015,12,18,10,Entanglement negativity in two-dimensional free lattice models,Viktor Eisler;Zoltán Zimborás,"We study the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement between finite subsystems of infinite two-dimensional free lattice models, as measured by the logarithmic negativity. For adjacent regions with a common boundary, we observe that the negativity follows a strict area law for a lattice of harmonic oscillators, whereas for fermionic hopping models the numerical results indicate a multiplicative logarithmic correction. In this latter case, we conjecture a formula for the prefactor of the area-law violating term, which is entirely determined by the geometries of the Fermi surface and the boundary between the subsystems. The conjecture is tested against numerical results and a good agreement is found."
1788,1511.04459,2015,12,1,10,Diagnosing Topological Edge States via Entanglement Monogamy,Konstantinos Meichanetzidis;Jens Eisert;Mauro Cirio;Ville Lahtinen;Jiannis K Pachos,"Topological phases of matter possess intricate correlation patterns typically probed by entanglement entropies or entanglement spectra. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to assessing topologically induced edge states in free and interacting fermionic systems. We do so by focussing on the fermionic covariance matrix. This matrix is often tractable either analytically or numerically and it precisely captures the relevant correlations of the system. By invoking the concept of monogamy of entanglement we show that highly entangled states supported across a system bi-partition are largely disentangled from the rest of the system, thus appearing usually as gapless edge states. We then define an entanglement qualifier that identifies the presence of topological edge states based purely on correlations present in the ground states. We demonstrate the versatility of this qualifier by applying it to various free and interacting fermionic topological systems."
1789,1511.00976,2015,11,17,10,Incompatibility of quantum testers,Michal Sedlak;Daniel Reitzner;Giulio Chiribella;Mario Ziman,"The existence of incompatible measurement setups is one of the distinctive features of quantum theory. Here we extend the notion of incompatibility from measurements that test preparations to measurements that test dynamical processes. Such measurements, known as testers, consist of the preparation of an input state, the application of the tested process, and a measurement on the output. Mathematically, testers are described by a suitable generalization of the notion of positive operator-valued measure (POVM). Unlike in the case of POVMs, however, testers that commute are not necessarily compatible, and testers that are compatible do not necessarily commute. Given a set of testers, we define the robustness of incompatibility as the minimum amount of mixing needed to make the testers compatible. We show that (i) the robustness is lower bounded by the distinguishability of the input states prepared by the different testers, and (ii) maximum robustness is attained when the input states are orthogonal. An extensive analysis of incompatibility is provided for factorized qubit testers with two outcomes. All our results can be extended to measurements that test quantum processes consisting of multiple time steps."
1790,1510.05655,2015,11,4,10,Characterization of decohering quantum systems: Machine learning approach,Markku P V Stenberg;Oliver Köhn;Frank K Wilhelm,"Adaptive data collection and analysis, where data are being fed back to update the measurement settings, can greatly increase speed, precision, and reliability of the characterization of quantum systems. However, decoherence tends to make adaptive characterization difficult. As an example, we consider two coupled discrete quantum systems. When one of the systems can be controlled and measured, the standard method to characterize another, with an unknown frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$, is swap spectroscopy. Here, adapting measurements can provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of measurement shots rather than as a power law in conventional swap spectroscopy. However, when the decoherence time is so short that an excitation oscillating between the two systems can only undergo less than a few tens of vacuum Rabi oscillations, this approach can be marred by a severe limit on accuracy unless carefully designed. We adopt machine learning techniques to search for efficient policies for the characterization of decohering quantum systems. We find, for instance, that when the system undergoes more than 2 Rabi oscillations during its relaxation time $T_1$, $O(10^3)$ measurement shots are sufficient to reduce the squared error of the Bayesian initial prior of the unknown frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$ by a factor $O(10^4)$ or larger. We also develop policies optimized for extreme initial parameter uncertainty and for the presence of imperfections in the readout."

Reducing these errors is critically important for quantum error correction to be viable. To quantify leakage errors, we use randomized benchmarking in conjunction with measurement of the leakage population. We characterize single qubit gates in a superconducting qubit, and by refining our use of Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulse shaping along with detuning of the pulses, we obtain gate errors consistently below $10^{-3}$ and leakage rates at the $10^{-5}$ level. With the control optimized, we find that a significant portion of the remaining leakage is due to incoherent heating of the qubit."
1792,1509.02921,2015,9,21,10,Introduction to Quantum Gate Set Tomography,Daniel Greenbaum,"Quantum gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a promising method for the full characterization of quantum logic gates. In contrast to quantum process tomography (QPT), GST self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than QPT as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of GST and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of GST as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of GST and QPT using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by QPT near quantum error correction thresholds, while GST is accurate in this regime."
1793,1509.01062,2015,9,11,10,Quantum conditional operations,Alessandro Bisio;Michele Dall'Arno;Paolo Perinotti,"An essential element of classical computation is the ""if-then"" construct, that accepts a control bit and an arbitrary gate, and provides conditional execution of the gate depending on the value of the controlling bit. On the other hand, quantum theory prevents the existence of an analogous universal construct accepting a control qubit and an arbitrary quantum gate as its input. Nevertheless, there are controllable sets of quantum gates for which such a construct exists. Here we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of unitary transformations to be controllable, and we give a complete characterization of controllable sets in the two dimensional case. This result reveals an interesting connection between the problem of controllability and the problem of extracting information from an unknown quantum gate while using it."

Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises security based on the laws of physics and has rapidly grown from proof-of-concept to robust demonstrations and even deployment of commercial systems. Despite these advances, QKD has not been widely adopted, and practical large-scale deployment will likely require integrated chip-based devices for improved performance, miniaturisation and enhanced functionality, fully integrated into classical communication networks. Here we report low error rate, GHz clocked QKD operation of an InP transmitter chip and a SiO$_x$N$_y$ receiver chip --- monolithically integrated devices that use state-of-the-art components and manufacturing processes from the telecom industry. We use the reconfigurability of these devices to demonstrate three important QKD protocols --- BB84, Coherent One Way (COW) and Differential Phase Shift (DPS) --- with performance comparable to state-of-the-art. These devices, when combined with integrated single photon detectors, satisfy the requirements at each of the levels of future QKD networks --- from point-of-use through to backbone --- and open the way to operation in existing and emerging classical communication networks."
1795,1508.04033,2015,9,3,10,Continuous error correction for Ising anyons,Adrian Hutter;James R Wootton,"Quantum gates in topological quantum computation are performed by braiding non-Abelian anyons. These braiding processes can presumably be performed with very low error rates. However, to make a topological quantum computation architecture truly scalable, even rare errors need to be corrected. Error correction for non-Abelian anyons is complicated by the fact that it needs to be performed on a continuous basis and further errors may occur while we are correcting existing ones. Here, we provide the first study of this problem and prove its feasibility, establishing non-Abelian anyons as a viable platform for scalable quantum computation. We thereby focus on Ising anyons as the most prominent example of non-Abelian anyons and show that for these a finite error rate can indeed be corrected continuously. There is a threshold error rate $p_c>0$ such that for all error rates $p<p_c$ the probability of a logical error per time-step can be made exponentially small in the distance of a logical qubit."
1796,1508.00897,2015,8,18,10,Canonical Energy is Quantum Fisher Information,Nima Lashkari;Mark Van Raamsdonk,"In quantum information theory, Fisher Information is a natural metric on the space of perturbations to a density matrix, defined by calculating the relative entropy with the unperturbed state at quadratic order in perturbations. In gravitational physics, Canonical Energy defines a natural metric on the space of perturbations to spacetimes with a Killing horizon. In this paper, we show that the Fisher information metric for perturbations to the vacuum density matrix of a ball-shaped region B in a holographic CFT is dual to the canonical energy metric for perturbations to a corresponding Rindler wedge R_B of Anti-de-Sitter space. Positivity of relative entropy at second order implies that the Fisher information metric is positive definite. Thus, for physical perturbations to anti-de-Sitter spacetime, the canonical energy associated to any Rindler wedge must be positive. This second-order constraint on the metric extends the first order result from relative entropy positivity that physical perturbations must satisfy the linearized Einstein's equations."

In this paper, we report on a special case in which this is possible. A spin chain can be engineered such that, in the absence of imperfections and noise, an unknown quantum state is transported from one end of the chain to the other, due only to the intrinsic dynamics of the system. We show that an encoding into a standard error correcting code (a Calderbank-Shor-Steane code) can be embedded into this simulation task such that a modified error correction procedure on read-out can recover from sufficiently low rates of noise during transport."
1799,1507.05255,2015,7,23,10,On the quantum measurement problem,Časlav Brukner,"In this paper, I attempt a personal account of my understanding of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, which has been largely in the tradition of the Copenhagen interpretation. I assume that (i) the quantum state is a representation of knowledge of a (real or hypothetical) observer relative to her experimental capabilities; (ii) measurements have definite outcomes in the sense that only one outcome occurs; (iii) quantum theory is universal and the irreversibility of the measurement process is only ""for all practical purposes"". These assumptions are analyzed within quantum theory and their consistency is tested in Deutsch's version of the Wigner's friend gedanken experiment, where the friend reveals to Wigner whether she observes a definite outcome without revealing which outcome she observes. The view that holds the coexistence of the ""facts of the world"" common both for Wigner and his friend runs into the problem of the hidden variable program. The solution lies in understanding that ""facts"" can only exist relative to the observer."
1800,1507.00240,2015,7,21,10,"On the Composition of Two-Prover Commitments, and Applications to Multi-Round Relativistic Commitments",Serge Fehr;Max Fillinger,"We consider the related notions of two-prover and of relativistic commitment schemes. In recent work, Lunghi et al. proposed a new relativistic commitment scheme with a multi-round sustain phase that enables to keep the binding property alive as long as the sustain phase is running. They prove security of their scheme against classical attacks; however, the proven bound on the error parameter is very weak: it blows up doubly exponentially in the number of rounds. In this work, we give a new analysis of the multi-round scheme of Lunghi et al., and we show a linear growth of the error parameter instead (also considering classical attacks only). Our analysis is based on a new and rather general composition theorem for two-prover commitment schemes. The proof of our composition theorem is based on a better understanding of the binding property of two-prover commitments that we provide in the form of new definitions and relations among them. These new insights are certainly of independent interest and are likely to be useful in other contexts as well. Finally, our work gives rise to several interesting open problems, for instance extending our results to the quantum setting, where the dishonest provers are allowed to perform measurements on an entangled quantum state in order to try to break the binding property."

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 2015] and present a new security analysis against classical attacks. In particular, while the initial complexity of the protocol scaled double-exponentially with the commitment time, our analysis shows that the correct dependence is only linear. This has dramatic implications in terms of implementation: in particular, the commitment time can easily be made arbitrarily long, by only requiring both parties to communicate classically and perform efficient classical computation."

This approach, which is based on exploiting the on-site symmetry of the model, has been shown to be surprisingly accurate for predicting some aspects of the critical behavior of the Ising model. Our investigation explores this approach in more generality, in a model where the critical behavior has a richer structure but which reduces to the simpler Ising case at a special point. We demonstrate that the correlation length critical exponent as predicted from this real-space renormalization group approach is in broad agreement with the corresponding results from conformal field theory along the line of criticality. Near the Ising special point, the error in the estimated critical exponent from this simple method is comparable to that of numerically-intensive simulations based on much more sophisticated methods, although the accuracy decreases away from the decoupled Ising model point."

The advertised merits of using weak measurements in this context are varied, but are generally represented by novelty, increased efficacy, and foundational significance. We critically evaluate two proposals that make such claims and find that weak measurements are not an essential ingredient for most of their advertised features."
1804,1506.03953,2015,7,1,10,Randomness in post-selected events,Le Phuc Thinh;Gonzalo de la Torre;Jean-Daniel Bancal;Stefano Pironio;Valerio Scarani,"Bell inequality violations can be used to certify private randomness for use in cryptographic applications. In photonic Bell experiments, a large amount of the data that is generated comes from no-detection events and presumably contains little randomness. This raises the question as to whether randomness can be extracted only from the smaller post-selected subset corresponding to proper detection events, instead of from the entire set of data. This could in principle be feasible without opening an analogue of the detection loophole as long as the min-entropy of the post-selected data is evaluated by taking all the information into account, including no-detection events. The possibility of extracting randomness from a short string has a practical advantage, because it reduces the computational time of the extraction. Here, we investigate the above idea in a simple scenario, where the devices and the adversary behave according to i.i.d. strategies. We show that indeed almost all the randomness is present in the pair of outcomes for which at least one detection happened. We further show that in some cases applying a pre-processing on the data can capture features that an analysis based on global frequencies only misses, thus resulting in the certification of more randomness. We then briefly consider non-i.i.d strategies and provide an explicit example of such a strategy that is more powerful than any i.i.d. one even in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many measurement rounds, something that was not reported before in the context of Bell inequalities."
1805,1506.03638,2015,6,15,10,Exploring complete positivity in hierarchy equations of motion,Björn Witt;Łukasz Rudnicki;Yoshitaka Tanimura;Florian Mintert,We derive a purely algebraic framework for the identification of hierarchy equations of motion that induce completely positive dynamics and demonstrate the applicability of our approach with several examples. We find bounds on the violation of complete positivity for microscopically derived hierarchy equations of motion and construct well-behaved phenomenological models with strongly non-Markovian revivals of quantum coherence.

The boundary states in conformal field theories play a crucial role in our formulation and the bulk diffeomorphism is naturally taken into account. We give an identification of bulk local operators which reproduces correct scalar field solutions on AdS3 and bulk scalar propagators. We also calculate the information metric for a locally excited state and show that it is given by that of 2d hyperbolic manifold, which is argued to describe the time slice of AdS3."
1807,1504.08295,2015,6,4,10,Spectral thresholding quantum tomography for low rank states,Cristina Butucea;Madalin Guta;Theodore Kypraios,"The estimation of high dimensional quantum states is an important statistical problem arising in current quantum technology applications. A key example is the tomography of multiple ions states, employed in the validation of state preparation in ion trap experiments \citeHaffner2005. Since full tomography becomes unfeasible even for a small number of ions, there is a need to investigate lower dimensional statistical models which capture prior information about the state, and to devise estimation methods tailored to such models. In this paper we propose several new methods aimed at the efficient estimation of low rank states in multiple ions tomography. All methods consist in first computing the least squares estimator, followed by its truncation to an appropriately chosen smaller rank. The latter is done by setting eigenvalues below a certain ""noise level"" to zero, while keeping the rest unchanged, or normalising them appropriately. We show that (up to logarithmic factors in the space dimension) the mean square error of the resulting estimators scales as $r\cdot d/N$ where $r$ is the rank, $d=2^k$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space, and $N$ is the number of quantum samples. Furthermore we establish a lower bound for the asymptotic minimax risk which shows that the above scaling is optimal. The performance of the estimators is analysed in an extensive simulations study, with emphasis on the dependence on the state rank, and the number of measurement repetitions. We find that all estimators perform significantly better that the least squares, with the ""physical estimator"" (which is a bona fide density matrix) slightly outperforming the other estimators."
1808,1504.04908,2015,5,1,10,On the Optimality of Square Root Measurements in Quantum State Discrimination,Nicola Dalla Pozza;Gianfranco Pierobon,"Distinguishing assigned quantum states with assigned probabilities via quantum measurements is a crucial problem for the transmission of classical information through quantum channels. Measurement operators maximizing the probability of correct discrimination have been characterized by Helstrom, Holevo and Yuen since 1970's. On the other hand, closed--form solutions are available only for particular situations enjoying high degrees of symmetry. As a suboptimal solution to the problem, measurement operators, directly determined from states and probabilities and known as square root measurements (SRM), were introduced by Hausladen and Wootters. These operators were also recognized to be optimal for pure states equipped with geometrical uniform symmetry (GUS). In this paper we discuss the optimality of the SRM and find necessary and sufficient conditions in order that SRM maximize the correct decision probabilities for set of states formed by several constellations of GUS states. The results are applied to some specific examples concerning double constellations of quantum phase shift keying (PSK) and pulse position modulation (PPM) states, with possible applications to practical systems of quantum communications."
1809,1504.04429,2015,4,21,10,Hierarchy of Bounds on Accessible Information and Informational Power,Michele Dall'Arno,"Quantum theory imposes fundamental limitations to the amount of information that can be carried by any quantum system. On the one hand, Holevo bound rules out the possibility to encode more information in a quantum system than in its classical counterpart, comprised of perfectly distinguishable states. On the other hand, when states are uniformly distributed in the state space, the so-called subentropy lower bound is saturated. How uniform quantum systems are can be naturally quantified by characterizing them as $t$-designs, with $t = \infty$ corresponding to the uniform distribution. Here we show the existence of a trade-off between the uniformity of a quantum system and the amount of information it can carry. To this aim, we derive a hierarchy of informational bounds as a function of $t$ and prove their tightness for qubits and qutrits. By deriving asymptotic formulae for large dimensions, we also show that the statistics generated by any $t$-design with $t > 1$ contains no more than a single bit of information, and this amount decreases with $t$. Holevo and subentropy bounds are recovered as particular cases for $t = 1$ and $t = \infty$, respectively."
1810,1504.02967,2015,4,20,10,Asymptotic Compatibility between LOCC Conversion and Recovery,Kosuke Ito;Wataru Kumagai;Masahito Hayashi,"Recently, entanglement concentration was explicitly shown to be irreversible. However, it is still not clear what kind of states can be reversibly converted in the asymptotic setting by LOCC when neither the initial nor the target state is maximally entangled. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the reversibility of LOCC conversions between two bipartite pure entangled states in the asymptotic setting. In addition, we show that conversion can be achieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition except for special cases. Interestingly, our result implies that an error-free reversible conversion is asymptotically possible even between states whose copies can never be locally unitarily equivalent with any finite numbers of copies, although such a conversion is impossible in the finite setting. In fact, we show such an example. Moreover, we establish how to overcome the irreversibility of LOCC conversion in two ways. As for the first method, we evaluate how many copies of the initial state is to be lost to overcome the irreversibility of LOCC conversion. The second method is to add a supplementary state appropriately, which also works for LU conversion unlike the first method. Especially, for the qubit system, any non-maximally pure entangled state can be a universal resource for the asymptotic reversibility when copies of the state is sufficiently many. More interestingly, our analysis implies that far-from-maximally entangled states can be better than nearly maximally entangled states as this type of resource. This fact brings new insight to the resource theory of state conversion."

Our main results are on applications to unitary error bases (UEBs), basic structures in quantum information which lie at the heart of procedures such as teleportation, dense coding and error correction. We present a new method for constructing a UEB from a quantum Latin square equipped with extra data. Developing construction techniques for UEBs has been a major activity in quantum computation, with three primary methods proposed: shift-and-multiply, Hadamard, and algebraic. We show that our new approach simultaneously generalizes the shift-and-multiply and Hadamard methods. Furthermore, we explicitly construct a UEB using our technique which we prove cannot be obtained from any of these existing methods."

However this very simplicity leads to limitations, such as the lack of deterministic entangling operations, which are compensated for by using substantial hardware overheads. Here we quantify the resource costs for full scale LOQC by proposing a specific protocol based on the surface code. With the caveat that our protocol can be further optimised, we report that the required number of physical components is at least five orders of magnitude greater than in comparable matter-based systems. Moreover the resource requirements grow higher if the per-component photon loss rate is worse than one in a thousand, or the per-component noise rate is worse than $10^{-5}$. We identify the performance of switches in the network as the single most influential factor influencing resource scaling."
1813,1504.01187,2015,4,10,10,Distinguishing Quantum and Classical Many-Body Systems,Dvir Kafri;Jacob M Taylor,"Controllable systems relying on quantum behavior to simulate distinctly quantum models so far rely on increasingly challenging classical computing to verify their results. We develop a general protocol for confirming that an arbitrary many-body system, such as a quantum simulator, can entangle distant objects. The protocol verifies that distant qubits interacting separately with the system can become mutually entangled, and therefore serves as a local test that excitations of the system can create non-local quantum correlations. We derive an inequality analogous to Bell's inequality which can only be violated through entanglement between distant sites of the many-body system. Although our protocol is applicable to general many-body systems, it requires finding system-dependent local operations to violate the inequality. A specific example in quantum magnetism is presented."

First we show that in general convex sets the boundariness essentially coincides with the question of the most distinguishable element, thus, providing an operational meaning for this concept. Unexpectedly, we discovered that for any interior point of the set of channels the optimal decomposition necessarily contains a unitary channel. In other words, for any given channel the best distinguishable one is some unitary channel. Further, we prove that boundariness is sub-multiplicative under composition of systems and explicitly evaluate its maximal value that is attained only for the most mixed elements of the considered convex structures."

We compute thresholds for the dimension of the system being traced out, so that the resulting bipartite quantum state satisfies the reduction criterion in different asymptotic regimes. We consider as well the basis-independent version of the reduction criterion (the absolute reduction criterion), computing thresholds for the corresponding eigenvalue sets. We do the same for other sets relevant in the study of absolute separability, using techniques from random matrix theory. Finally, we gather and compare the known values for the thresholds corresponding to different entanglement criteria, and conclude with a list of open questions."
1816,1503.02127,2015,3,30,10,Relation of classical non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum annealing,Hidetoshi Nishimori,"Non-equilibrium dynamics of the Ising model is a classical stochastic process whereas quantum mechanics has no stochastic elements in the classical sense. Nevertheless, it has been known that there exists a close formal relationship between these two processes. We reformulate this relationship and use it to compare the efficiency of simulated annealing that uses classical stochastic processes and quantum annealing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It is shown that classical dynamics can be efficiently simulated by quantum-mechanical processes whereas the converse is not necessarily true. This may imply that quantum annealing may be regarded as a more powerful tool than simulated annealing for optimization problems."
1817,1503.01369,2015,3,10,10,Beyond adiabatic elimination: Effective Hamiltonians and singular perturbation,Mikel Sanz;Enrique Solano;Íñigo L Egusquiza,"Adiabatic elimination is a standard tool in quantum optics, which produces an effective Hamiltonian for a relevant subspace of states, incorporating effects of its coupling to states with much higher unperturbed energy. It shares with techniques from other fields the emphasis on the existence of widely separated scales. Given this fact, the question arises whether it is feasible to improve on the adiabatic approximation, similarly to some of those other approaches. A number of authors have addressed the issue from the quantum optics/atomic physics perspective, and have run into the issue of non-hermiticity of the effective Hamiltonian improved beyond the adiabatic approximation, which poses conceptual and practical problems. Here, we first briefly survey methods present in the physics literature. Next, we rewrite the problems addressed by the adiabatic elimination technique to make apparent the fact that they are singular perturbation problems from the point of view of dynamical systems. We apply the invariant manifold method for singular perturbation problems to this case, and show that this method produces the equation named after Bloch in nuclear physics. Given the wide separation of scales, it becomes intuitive that the Bloch equation admits iterative/perturbative solutions. We show, using a fixed point theorem, that indeed the iteration converges to a perturbative solution that produces in turn an exact Hamiltonian for the relevant subspace. We propose thus several sequences of effective Hamiltonians, starting with the adiabatic elimination and improving on it. We show the origin of the non-hermiticity, and that it is inessential given the isospectrality of the effective non-hermitian operator and a corresponding effective hermitian operator, which we build. We propose an application of the introduced techniques to periodic Hamiltonians."
1818,1502.06618,2015,3,5,10,Holographic codes,Jose I Latorre;German Sierra,"There exists a remarkable four-qutrit state that carries absolute maximal entanglement in all its partitions. Employing this state, we construct a tensor network that delivers a holographic many body state, the H-code, where the physical properties of the boundary determine those of the bulk. This H-code is made of an even superposition of states whose relative Hamming distances are exponentially large with the size of the boundary. This property makes H-codes natural states for a quantum memory. H-codes exist on tori of definite sizes and get classified in three different sectors characterized by the sum of their qutrits on cycles wrapped through the boundaries of the system. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the H-code which is highly non local and finally we compute the topological entanglement entropy of the H-code."
1819,1502.06504,2015,2,25,10,Experimental access to higher-dimensional entangled quantum systems using integrated optics,Christoph Schaeff;Robert Polster;Marcus Huber;Sven Ramelow;Anton Zeilinger,"Integrated optics allow the generation and control of increasingly complex photonic states on chip based architectures. Here, we implement two entangled qutrits - a 9-dimensional quantum system - and demonstrate an exceptionally high degree of experimental control. The approach which is conceptually different to common bulk optical implementations is heavily based on methods of integrated in-fiber and on-chip technologies and further motivated by methods commonly used in today's telecommunication industry. The system is composed of an in-fiber source creating entangled qutrit states of any amplitude and phase and an on-chip integrated general Multiport enabling the realization of any desired local unitary transformation within the two qutrit 9-dimensional Hilbert space. The complete design is readily extendible towards higher-dimensions with moderate increase in complexity. Ultimately, our scheme allows for complete on-chip integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our system by realizing a complete characterization of the two qutrit space of higher-order Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations."
1820,1501.06950,2015,2,24,10,Continuous Limit of Discrete Quantum Walks,Dheeraj M N;Todd A Brun,"Quantum walks can be defined in two quite distinct ways: discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walks (DTQWs and CTQWs). For classical random walks, there is a natural sense in which continuous-time walks are a limit of discrete-time walks. Quantum mechanically, in the discrete-time case, an additional ""coin space"" must be appended for the walk to have nontrivial time evolution. Continuous-time quantum walks, however, have no such constraints. This means that there is no completely straightforward way to treat a CTQW as a limit of DTQW, as can be done in the classical case. Various approaches to this problem have been taken in the past. We give a construction for walks on $d$-regular, $d$-colorable graphs when the coin flip operator is Hermitian: from a standard DTQW we construct a family of discrete-time walks with a well-defined continuous-time limit on a related graph. One can think of this limit as a \it coined continuous-time walk. We show that these CTQWs share some properties with coined DTQWs. In particular, we look at spatial search by a DTQW over the 2-D torus (a grid with periodic boundary conditions) of size $\sqrt{N}\times\sqrt{N}$, where it was shown \nociteAAmbainis08 that a coined DTQW can search in time $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$, but a standard CTQW \nociteChilds2004 takes $\Omega(N)$ time to search for a marked element. The continuous limit of the DTQW search over the 2-D torus exhibits the $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$ scaling, like the coined walk it is derived from. We also look at the effects of graph symmetry on the limiting walk, and show that the properties are similar to those of the DTQW as shown in \citeHariKrovi2007."

At present, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been one of the most successful platforms amongst all current implementations. It has demonstrated universal controls on the largest number of qubits, and many advanced techniques developed in NMR have been adopted to other quantum systems successfully. In this review, we show how NMR quantum processors can satisfy the general requirements of a quantum computer, and describe advanced techniques developed towards this target. Additionally, we review some recent NMR quantum processor experiments. These experiments include benchmarking protocols, quantum error correction, demonstrations of algorithms exploiting quantum properties, exploring the foundations of quantum mechanics, and quantum simulations. Finally we summarize the concepts and comment on future prospects."
1822,1412.4126,2014,1,8,10,Characterization of Leakage Errors via Randomized Benchmarking,Joel J Wallman;Marie Barnhill;Joseph Emerson,"Leakage errors arise when the quantum state leaks out of some subspace of interest, for example, the two-level subspace of a multi-level system defining a computational `qubit' or the logical code space defined by some quantum error-correcting code or decoherence-free subspace. Leakage errors pose a distinct challenge to quantum control relative to the more well-studied decoherence errors and can be a limiting factor to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we present scalable and robust randomized benchmarking protocols for quickly estimating the rates of both coherent and incoherent leakage, allowing for practical minimization of the leakage rate by varying over control methods. We illustrate the reliability of the protocol through numerical simulations with physically-relevant error models."

In this work we study the probability of the nonlocal nature of these correlations as a function of $\alpha=\frac{m}{n}$, where the previous vectors are sampled according to the Haar measure in the unit sphere of $\mathbb R^m$. In particular, we prove the existence of an $\alpha_0>0$ such that if $\alpha\leq \alpha_0$, $\gamma$ is nonlocal with probability tending to $1$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$, while for $\alpha> 2$, $\gamma$ is local with probability tending to $1$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$."

A growing number of contributions try to use this advantage in order to improve or extend classical machine learning algorithms by methods of quantum information theory. This paper gives a brief introduction into quantum machine learning using the example of pattern classification. We introduce a quantum pattern classification algorithm that draws on Trugenberger's proposal for measuring the Hamming distance on a quantum computer (CA Trugenberger, Phys Rev Let 87, 2001) and discuss its advantages using handwritten digit recognition as from the MNIST database."
1825,1412.0750,2014,12,12,10,Multi-scale quantum simulation of quantum field theory using wavelets,Gavin K Brennen;Peter P Rohde;Barry C Sanders;Sukhwinder Singh,"A successful approach to understand field theories is to resolve the physics into different length or energy scales using the renormalization group framework. We propose a quantum simulation of quantum field theory which encodes field degrees of freedom in a wavelet basis---a multi-scale description of the theory. Since wavelets are compact wavefunctions, this encoding allows for quantum simulations to create particle excitations with compact support and provides a natural way to associate observables in the theory to finite resolution detectors. We show that the wavelet basis is well suited to compute subsystem entanglement entropy by dividing the field into contributions from short-range wavelet degrees of freedom and long-range scale degrees of freedom, of which the latter act as renormalized modes which capture the essential physics at a renormalization fixed point."
1826,1411.6702,2014,12,3,10,$d$ locally indistinguishable maximally entangled states in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^d$,Mao-Sheng Li;Yan-Ling Wang;Shao-Ming Fei;Zhu-Jun Zheng,We give a explicit construction of $d$ locally indistinguishable orthogonal maximally entangled states in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^d$ for any $d\geq 4$. This gives an answer to the conjecture proposed by S. Bandyopadhyay in 2009. Thus it reflects the nonlocality of the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics.
1827,1411.5907,2014,11,26,10,Smallest state spaces for which bipartite entangled quantum states are separable,Hussain Anwar;Sania Jevtic;Oliver Rudolph;Shashank Virmani,"According to usual definitions, entangled states cannot be given a separable decomposition in terms of products of local density operators. If we relax the requirement that the local density operators be positive, then an entangled quantum state may admit a separable decomposition in terms of more general sets of single-system operators. This form of separability can be used to construct classical models and simulation methods when only restricted set of measurements are available. With such motivations in mind, we ask what are the smallest such sets of local operators such that a pure bipartite entangled quantum state becomes separable? We find that in the case of maximally entangled states there are many inequivalent solutions, including for example the sets of phase point operators that arise in the study of discrete Wigner functions. We therefore provide a new way of interpreting these operators, and more generally, provide an alternative method for constructing local hidden variable models for entangled quantum states under subsets of quantum measurements."
1828,1411.3439,2014,11,24,10,Superactivation of quantum gyroscopes,Giulio Chiribella;Rui Chao;Yuxiang Yang,"Quantum particles with spin are the most elementary gyroscopes existing in nature. Can two such gyroscopes help two distant observers find out their relative orientation in space? Here we show that a single pair of gyroscopes in an EPR state gives little clue about the relative orientation, but when two or more EPR pairs are used in parallel, suddenly a common reference frame emerges, with an error that drops quickly with the size of the system, beating than the best classical scaling already for small number of copies. This activation phenomenon indicates the presence of a latent resource hidden into EPR correlations, which can be unlocked and turned into advantage when multiple copies are available."
1829,1411.3035,2014,11,14,10,Distinguishability and copiability of programs in general process theories,Giulio Chiribella,"We propose a notion of state distinguishability that does not refer to probabilities, but rather to the ability of a set of states to serve as programs for a desired set of gates. Using this notion, we reconstruct the structural features of the task of state discrimination, such as the equivalence with cloning and the impossibility to extract information from two non-distinguishable pure states without causing a disturbance. All these features express intrinsic links among operational tasks, which are valid independently of the particular theory under consideration."
1830,1411.2315,2014,11,13,10,"Multi-Source Randomness Extractors Against Quantum Side Information, and their Applications",Kai-Min Chung;Xin Li;Xiaodi Wu,"We study the problem of constructing multi-source extractors in the quantum setting, which extract almost uniform random bits against quantum side information collected from several initially independent classical random sources. This is a natural generalization of seeded randomness extraction against quantum side information and classical independent source extraction. With new challenges such as potential entanglement in the side information, it is not a prior clear under what conditions do quantum multi-source extractors exist; the only previous work is [KK12], where the classical inner-product two-source extractors of [CG88] and [DEOR04] are shown to be quantum secure in the restricted Independent Adversary (IA) Model and entangled Bounded Storage (BS) Model. In this paper we propose a new model called General Entangled (GE) Adversary Model, which allows arbitrary entanglement in the side information and subsumes both the IA model and the BS model. We proceed to show how to construct GE-secure quantum multi-source extractors. To that end, we propose another model called One-sided Adversary (OA) Model, which is weaker than all the above models. Somewhat surprisingly, we establish equivalence between strong OA-security and strong GE-security. As a result, all classical multi-source extractors can either directly work, or be modified to work in the GE model at the cost of one extra random source. Thus, our constructions essentially match the best known constructions of classical multi-source extractors. We also apply our techniques to two important problems in cryptography and distributed computing --- privacy amplification and network extractor. We show that as long as the sources have certain amounts of conditional min-entropy in our GE model (even with entangled quantum side information), we can design very efficient privacy amplification protocols and network extractors."
1831,1410.8019,2014,11,11,10,Bounding the seed length of Miller and Shi's unbounded randomness expansion protocol,Renan Gross;Scott Aaronson,"Recent randomness expansion protocols have been proposed which are able to generate an unbounded amount of randomness from a finite amount of truly random initial seed. One such protocol, given by Miller and Shi, uses a pair of non-signaling untrusted quantum mechanical devices. These play XOR games with inputs given by the user in order to generate an output. Here we present an analysis of the required seed size, giving explicit upper bounds for the number of initial random bits needed to jump-start the protocol. The bits output from such a protocol are $\varepsilon$-close to uniform even against quantum adversaries. Our analysis yields that for a statistical distance of $\varepsilon=10^{-1}$ and $\varepsilon=10^{-6}$ from uniformity, the number of required bits is smaller than 225,000 and 715,000, respectively; in general it grows as $O(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$."
1832,1410.6072,2014,10,30,10,Nuclear Norm of Higher-Order Tensors,Shmuel Friedland;Lek-Heng Lim,"We establish several mathematical and computational properties of the nuclear norm for higher-order tensors. We show that like tensor rank, tensor nuclear norm is dependent on the choice of base field --- the value of the nuclear norm of a real 3-tensor depends on whether we regard it as a real 3-tensor or a complex 3-tensor with real entries. We show that every tensor has a nuclear norm attaining decomposition and every symmetric tensor has a symmetric nuclear norm attaining decomposition. There is a corresponding notion of nuclear rank that, unlike tensor rank, is upper semicontinuous. We establish an analogue of Banach's theorem for tensor spectral norm and Comon's conjecture for tensor rank --- for a symmetric tensor, its symmetric nuclear norm always equals its nuclear norm. We show that computing tensor nuclear norm is NP-hard in several sense. Deciding weak membership in the nuclear norm unit ball of 3-tensors is NP-hard, as is finding an $\varepsilon$-approximation of nuclear norm for 3-tensors. In addition, the problem of computing spectral or nuclear norm of a 4-tensor is NP-hard, even if we restrict the 4-tensor to be bi-Hermitian, bisymmetric, positive semidefinite, nonnegative valued, or all of the above. We discuss some simple polynomial-time approximation bounds. As an aside, we show that the nuclear $(p,q)$-norm of a matrix is NP-hard in general but can be computed in polynomial-time if $p=1$, $q = 1$, or $p=q=2$, with closed-form expressions for the nuclear $(1,q)$- and $(p,1)$-norms."

Using a photonic qubit coupled to a simulated environment we tomographically reconstruct a superchannel---a generalised channel that treats preparation procedures as inputs---from measurement of the system alone, despite its coupling to the environment. We introduce novel quantitative measures for determining the strength of initial correlations, and to allow an experiment to be optimised in regards to its environment."

Borrowing ideas from percolation theory we numerically show that using unambiguous Bell measurements that succeed with 75% success probability, one could build a cluster state with an underlying pyrochlore geometry such that the probability of having a spanning cluster in a chosen direction approaches unity in the limit of an infinite lattice size. The initial resources required for the generation of a universal state in our protocol are 3-qubit cluster states that are within experimental reach and are a minimal resource for a Bell-measurement-based percolation proposal. Since single and multi-photon losses can be detected in Bell measurements, our protocol raises the prospect of a fully error-robust scheme."
1835,1410.2435,2014,10,15,10,Quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on universal quantum circuit,Min Liang,"Fully homomorphic encryption enables arbitrary computation on encrypted data without decrypting the data. Here it is studied in the context of quantum information processing. Based on universal quantum circuit, we present a quantum fully homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme, which permits arbitrary quantum transformation on an encrypted data. The QFHE scheme is proved to be perfectly secure. In the scheme, the decryption key is different from the encryption key, however, the encryption key cannot be public. Moreover, the evaluate algorithm of the scheme is independent of the encryption key, so it is very applicable in delegated quantum computing between two parties."
1836,1410.0947,2014,10,10,10,No quantum realization of extremal no-signaling boxes,Ravishankar Ramanathan;Jan Tuziemski;Michał Horodecki;Paweł Horodecki,"Pure states are very important in any theory since they represent states of maximal information about the system within the theory. Here, we show that no non-trivial (not local realistic) extremal states (boxes) of general no-signaling theories can be realized within quantum theory. We then explore three interesting consequences of this fact. Firstly, since the pure states are uncorrelated from the environment, the statement forms a no-go result against the most straightforward device-independent protocol for randomness or secure key generation against general no-signaling adversaries. It also leads to the interesting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local correlations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new information-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum correlations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on arbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the possibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling correlations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also forms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum winning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique non-signaling winning strategy. We illustrate each of these consequences with the example of generalized Popescu-Rohrlich boxes."
1837,1409.7358,2014,10,6,10,Compact wavefunctions from compressed imaginary time evolution,Jarrod R McClean;Alán Aspuru-Guzik,"Simulation of quantum systems promises to deliver physical and chemical predictions for the frontiers of technology. Unfortunately, the exact representation of these systems is plagued by the exponential growth of dimension with the number of particles, or colloquially, the curse of dimensionality. The success of approximation methods has hinged on the relative simplicity of physical systems with respect to the exponentially complex worst case. Exploiting this relative simplicity has required detailed knowledge of the physical system under study. In this work, we introduce a general and efficient black box method for many-body quantum systems that utilizes technology from compressed sensing to find the most compact wavefunction possible without detailed knowledge of the system. It is a Multicomponent Adaptive Greedy Iterative Compression (MAGIC) scheme. No knowledge is assumed in the structure of the problem other than correct particle statistics. This method can be applied to many quantum systems such as spins, qubits, oscillators, or electronic systems. As an application, we use this technique to compute ground state electronic wavefunctions of hydrogen fluoride and recover 98% of the basis set correlation energy or equivalently 99.996% of the total energy with $50$ configurations out of a possible $10^7$. Building from this compactness, we introduce the idea of nuclear union configuration interaction for improving the description of reaction coordinates and use it to study the dissociation of hydrogen fluoride and the helium dimer."
1838,1409.5804,2014,9,26,10,The resource theory of steering,Rodrigo Gallego;Leandro Aolita,"We present an operational framework for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering as a physical resource. To begin with, we characterize the set of steering non-increasing operations (SNIOs) --i.e., those that do not create steering-- on arbitrary-dimensional bipartite systems composed of a quantum subsystem and a black-box device. Next, we introduce the notion of convex steering monotones as the fundamental axiomatic quantifiers of steering. As a convenient example thereof, we present the relative entropy of steering. In addition, we prove that two previously proposed quantifiers, the steerable weight and the robustness of steering, are also convex steering monotones. To end up with, for minimal-dimensional systems, we establish, on the one hand, necessary and sufficient conditions for pure-state steering conversions under stochastic SNIOs and prove, on the other hand, the non-existence of steering bits, i.e., measure-independent maximally steerable states from which all states can be obtained by means of the free operations. Our findings reveal unexpected aspects of steering and lay foundations for further resource-theory approaches, with potential implications in Bell non-locality."

Paparo et al., Sci. Rep. 2, 444 (2012) and G.D. Paparo et al., Sci. Rep. 3, 2773 (2013)) applied to large complex networks. The algorithm has been shown to identify unambiguously the underlying topology of the network and to be capable of clearly highlighting the structure of secondary hubs of networks. Furthermore, it can resolve the degeneracy in importance of the low-lying part of the list of rankings. Examples of applications include real-world instances from the WWW, which typically display a scale-free network structure and models of hierarchical networks. The quantum algorithm has been shown to display an increased stability with respect to a variation of the damping parameter, present in the Google algorithm, and a more clearly pronounced power-law behaviour in the distribution of importance among the nodes, as compared to the classical algorithm."
1840,1409.3558,2014,9,15,10,A universal adiabatic quantum query algorithm,Mathieu Brandeho;Jérémie Roland,"Quantum query complexity is known to be characterized by the so-called quantum adversary bound. While this result has been proved in the standard discrete-time model of quantum computation, it also holds for continuous-time (or Hamiltonian-based) quantum computation, due to a known equivalence between these two query complexity models. In this work, we revisit this result by providing a direct proof in the continuous-time model. One originality of our proof is that it draws new connections between the adversary bound, a modern technique of theoretical computer science, and early theorems of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the proof of the lower bound is based on Ehrenfest's theorem, while the upper bound relies on the adiabatic theorem, as it goes by constructing a universal adiabatic quantum query algorithm. Another originality is that we use for the first time in the context of quantum computation a version of the adiabatic theorem that does not require a spectral gap."

Using this Lie algebraic formulation, we identify and construct highly symmetric states that admit Heisenberg scaling in precision in the absence of noise, and investigate their performance in the presence of noise. To this aim we perform a numerical scaling analysis, and derive upper bounds on the quantum Fisher information."

So-called spherical quantum 2-designs constitute a class of ensembles and measurements relevant in testing entropic uncertainty relations, quantum cryptography, and quantum tomography. We provide lower bounds on the entropy of 2-design ensembles and measurements, from which upper bounds on their accessible information and informational power follow, as a function of the dimension only. We show that the statistics generated by 2-designs, although optimal for the abovementioned protocols, never contains more than one bit of information. Finally, we specialize our results to the relevant cases of symmetric informationally complete (SIC) sets and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), and we generalize them to the arbitrary-rank case."

Given $n$ matrices $A_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, of the same size, let $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ be the block matrices $Z_1:=(A_jA_i^*)_{i,j=1}^n$ and $Z_2:=(A_j^*A_i)_{i,j=1}^n$. Then the conjectured inequality is \[ \left(||Z_1||_1-\trace Z_1\right)^2 + \left(||Z_2||_1-\trace Z_2\right)^2 \le \left(\sum_i≠j ||A_i||_2 ||A_j||_2\right)^2. \]We prove this inequality for the already challenging case $n=2$ with $A_1$ equal to the identity matrix."

Here, we show that the Renyi mutual information attains operational meaning in the context of composite hypothesis testing, when the null hypothesis is a fixed bipartite state and the alternate hypothesis consists of all product states that share one marginal with the null hypothesis. This hypothesis testing problem occurs naturally in channel coding, where it corresponds to testing whether a state is the output of a given quantum channel or of a 'useless' channel whose output is decoupled from the environment. Similarly, we establish an operational interpretation of Renyi conditional entropy by choosing an alternative hypothesis that consists of product states that are maximally mixed on one system. Specialized to classical probability distributions, our results also establish an operational interpretation of Renyi mutual information and Renyi conditional entropy."
1845,1408.5689,2014,9,1,10,Composable security proof for continuous-variable quantum key distribution with coherent states,Anthony Leverrier,"We give the first composable security proof for continuous-variable quantum key distribution with coherent states against collective attacks. Crucially, in the limit of large blocks the secret key rate converges to the usual value computed from the Holevo bound. Combining our proof with either the de Finetti theorem or the Postselection technique then shows the security of the protocol against general attacks, thereby confirming the long-standing conjecture that Gaussian attacks are optimal asymptotically in the composable security framework. We expect that our parameter estimation procedure, which does not rely on any assumption, will find applications elsewhere, for instance for the reliable quantification of continuous-variable entanglement in finite-size settings."
1846,1408.4382,2014,8,26,10,Quantum annealing correction for random Ising problems,Kristen L Pudenz;Tameem Albash;Daniel A Lidar,"We demonstrate that the performance of a quantum annealer on hard random Ising optimization problems can be substantially improved using quantum annealing correction (QAC). Our error correction strategy is tailored to the D-Wave Two device. We find that QAC provides a statistically significant enhancement in the performance of the device over a classical repetition code, improving as a function of problem size as well as hardness. Moreover, QAC provides a mechanism for overcoming the precision limit of the device, in addition to correcting calibration errors. Performance is robust even to missing qubits. We present evidence for a constructive role played by quantum effects in our experiments by contrasting the experimental results with the predictions of a classical model of the device. Our work demonstrates the importance of error correction in appropriately determining the performance of quantum annealers."
1847,1408.1395,2014,8,20,10,Acceleration-assisted entanglement harvesting and rangefinding,Grant Salton;Robert B Mann;Nicolas C Menicucci,"We study entanglement harvested from a quantum field through local interaction with Unruh-DeWitt detectors undergoing linear acceleration. The interactions allow entanglement to be swapped locally from the field to the detectors. We find an enhancement in the entanglement harvesting by two detectors with anti-parallel acceleration over those with inertial motion. This enhancement is characterized by the presence of entanglement between two detectors that would otherwise maintain a separable state in the absence of relativistic motion (with the same distance of closest approach in both cases). We also find that entanglement harvesting is degraded for two detectors undergoing parallel acceleration in the same way as for two static, comoving detectors in a de Sitter universe. This degradation is known to be different from that of two inertial detectors in a thermal bath. We comment on the physical origin of the harvested entanglement and present three methods for determining distance between two detectors using properties of the harvested entanglement. Information about the separation is stored nonlocally in the joint state of the accelerated detectors after the interaction; a single detector alone contains none. We also find an example of entanglement sudden death exhibited in parameter space."

Then, we use these estimates to study the classical capacity with restricted assisted entanglement of the quantum erasure channel and the quantum depolarizing channel. In particular, we exactly compute the capacity of the first one and we show that certain nonmultiplicative results hold for the second one."

The classical algorithm is constructed by decomposing a quantum channel into a convex combination of generalized extreme channels by optimization of a set of nonlinear coupled algebraic equations. The resultant circuit is a randomly chosen generalized extreme channel circuit whose run-time is logarithmic with respect to the error tolerance and quadratic with respect to Hilbert space dimension, which requires only a single ancillary qudit plus classical dits."

We prove that the problem of computation of the commuting quantum chromatic number of a graph is solvable by an SDP algorithm and describe an hierarchy of variants of the commuting quantum chromatic number which converge to it. We introduce the tracial rank of a graph, a parameter that gives a lower bound for the commuting quantum chromatic number and parallels the projective rank, and prove that it is multiplicative. We describe the tracial rank, the projective rank and the fractional chromatic numbers in a unified manner that clarifies their connection with the commuting quantum chromatic number, the quantum chromatic number and the classical chromatic number, respectively. Finally, we present a new SDP algorithm that yields a parameter larger than the Lovász number and is yet a lower bound for the tracial rank of the graph. We determine the precise value of the tracial rank of an odd cycle."

It has been shown that the precision of estimating an overall multiplicative factor of a Hamiltonian can be increased to exceed the classical limit, yet little is known about estimating a general Hamiltonian parameter. In this paper, we study this problem in detail. We find that the scaling of the estimation precision with the number of systems can always be optimized to the Heisenberg limit, while the time scaling can be quite different from that of estimating an overall multiplicative factor. We derive the generator of local parameter translation on the unitary evolution operator of the Hamiltonian, and use it to evaluate the estimation precision of the parameter and establish a general upper bound on the quantum Fisher information. The results indicate that the quantum Fisher information generally can be divided into two parts: one is quadratic in time, while the other oscillates with time. When the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian do not depend on the parameter, the quadratic term vanishes, and the quantum Fisher information will be bounded in this case. To illustrate the results, we give an example of estimating a parameter of a magnetic field by measuring a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle, and compare the results for estimating the amplitude and the direction of the magnetic field."
1852,1407.4419,2014,7,24,10,Irreversibility and Entanglement Spectrum Statistics in Quantum Circuits,Daniel Shaffer;Claudio Chamon;Alioscia Hamma;Eduardo R Mucciolo,"We show that in a quantum system evolving unitarily under a stochastic quantum circuit the notions of irreversibility, universality of computation, and entanglement are closely related. As the state evolves from an initial product state, it gets asymptotically maximally entangled. We define irreversibility as the failure of searching for a disentangling circuit using a Metropolis-like algorithm. We show that irreversibility corresponds to Wigner-Dyson statistics in the level spacing of the entanglement eigenvalues, and that this is obtained from a quantum circuit made from a set of universal gates for quantum computation. If, on the other hand, the system is evolved with a non-universal set of gates, the statistics of the entanglement level spacing deviates from Wigner-Dyson and the disentangling algorithm succeeds. These results open a new way to characterize irreversibility in quantum systems."
1853,1407.1858,2014,7,17,10,Trapped-ion quantum error-correcting protocols using only global operations,Joseph F Goodwin;Benjamin J Brown;Graham Stutter;Howard Dale;Richard C Thompson;Terry G Rudolph,"Quantum error-correcting codes are many-body entangled states that are prepared and measured using complex sequences of entangling operations. Each element of such an entangling sequence introduces noise to delicate quantum information during the encoding or reading out of the code. It is important therefore to find efficient entangling protocols to avoid the loss of information. Here we propose an experiment that uses only global entangling operations to encode an arbitrary logical qubit to either the five-qubit repetition code or the five-qubit code, with a six-ion Coulomb crystal architecture in a Penning trap. We show that the use of global operations enables us to prepare and read out these codes using only six and ten global entangling pulses, respectively. The proposed experiment also allows the acquisition of syndrome information during readout. We provide a noise analysis for the presented protocols, estimating that we can achieve a six-fold improvement in coherence time with noise as high as $\sim 1\%$ on each entangling operation."
1854,1406.7189,2014,7,9,10,Quantum Communication with Coherent States and Linear Optics,Juan Miguel Arrazola;Norbert Lütkenhaus,"We introduce a general mapping for encoding quantum communication protocols involving pure states of multiple qubits, unitary transformations, and projective measurements into another set of protocols that employ coherent states of light in a superposition of optical modes, linear optics transformations and measurements with single-photon threshold detectors. This provides a general framework for transforming protocols in quantum communication into a form in which they can be implemented with current technology. We explore the similarity between properties of the original qubit protocols and the coherent-state protocols obtained from the mapping and make use of the mapping to construct new protocols in the context of quantum communication complexity and quantum digital signatures. Our results have the potential of bringing a wide class of quantum communication protocols closer to their experimental demonstration."
1855,1406.5879,2014,6,30,10,Breaking information-thermodynamics link,Robert Alicki,"The information-thermodynamics link is revisited, going back to the analysis of Szilard's engine. It is argued that instead of equivalence rather complementarity of physical entropy and information theoretical one is a correct concept. Famous Landauer's formula for a minimal cost of information processing is replaced by a new one which takes into account accuracy and stability of information encoding. Two recent experiments illustrating the information-energy conversion are critically discussed."
1856,1406.5149,2014,6,24,10,A silicon-based surface code quantum computer,Joe O'Gorman;Naomi H Nickerson;Philipp Ross;John J L Morton;Simon C Benjamin,"Individual impurity atoms in silicon can make superb individual qubits, but it remains an immense challenge to build a multi-qubit processor: There is a basic conflict between nanometre separation desired for qubit-qubit interactions, and the much larger scales that would enable control and addressing in a manufacturable and fault tolerant architecture. Here we resolve this conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing using solid state spins, or `data qubits', that are widely separated from one another. We employ a second set of `probe' spins which are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin dipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path. We introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being imperfectly located during device fabrication. Detailed simulations show that the surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are substantial on the scale of the array, indicating that it is very robust. We conclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid state quantum computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems."
1857,1406.4418,2014,6,20,10,Quantum-locked key distribution at nearly the classical capacity rate,Cosmo Lupo;Seth Lloyd,"Quantum data locking is a protocol that allows for a small secret key to (un)lock an exponentially larger amount of information, hence yielding the strongest violation of the classical one-time pad encryption in the quantum setting. This violation mirrors a large gap existing between two security criteria for quantum cryptography quantified by two entropic quantities: the Holevo information and the accessible information. We show that the latter becomes a sensible security criterion if an upper bound on the coherence time of the eavesdropper's quantum memory is known. Under this condition we introduce a protocol for secret key generation through a memoryless qudit channel. For channels with enough symmetry, such as the d-dimensional erasure and depolarizing channels, this protocol allows secret key generation at an asymptotic rate as high as the classical capacity minus one bit."
1858,1406.3829,2014,6,18,10,Operational quantum theory without predefined time,Ognyan Oreshkov;Nicolas J Cerf,"The standard formulation of quantum theory assumes a predefined notion of time. This is a major obstacle in the search for a quantum theory of gravity, where the causal structure of space-time is expected to be dynamical and fundamentally probabilistic in character. Here, we propose a generalized formulation of quantum theory without predefined time or causal structure, building upon a recently introduced operationally time-symmetric approach to quantum theory. The key idea is a novel isomorphism between transformations and states which depends on the symmetry transformation of time reversal. This allows us to express the time-symmetric formulation in a time-neutral form with a clear physical interpretation, and ultimately drop the assumption of time. In the resultant generalized formulation, operations are associated with regions that can be connected in networks with no directionality assumed for the connections, generalizing the standard circuit framework and the process matrix framework for operations without global causal order. The possible events in a given region are described by positive semidefinite operators on a Hilbert space at the boundary, while the connections between regions are described by entangled states that encode a nontrivial symmetry and could be tested in principle. We discuss how the causal structure of space-time could be understood as emergent from properties of the operators on the boundaries of compact space-time regions. The framework is compatible with indefinite causal order, timelike loops, and other acausal structures."

The success of quantum approaches to related tasks in a delegated computation setting has raised the question of whether quantum mechanics may be used to achieve information theoretically secure fully homomorphic encryption. Here we show, via an information localisation argument, that deterministic fully homomorphic encryption necessarily incurs exponential overhead if perfect security is required."
1860,1405.7778,2014,6,11,10,Universal Quantum Computation with Metaplectic Anyons,Shawn X Cui;Zhenghan Wang,"We show that braidings of the metaplectic anyons $X_\epsilon$ in $SO(3)_2=SU(2)_4$ with their total charge equal to the metaplectic mode $Y$ supplemented with measurements of the total charge of two metaplectic anyons are universal for quantum computation. We conjecture that similar universal computing models can be constructed for all metaplectic anyon systems $SO(p)_2$ for any odd prime $p\geq 5$. In order to prove universality, we find new conceptually appealing universal gate sets for qutrits and qupits."
1861,1405.5563,2014,6,2,10,Constructor Theory of Information,David Deutsch;Chiara Marletto,"We present a theory of information expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible - i.e. in constructor-theoretic terms. Although it includes conjectured laws of physics that are directly about information, independently of the details of particular physical instantiations, it does not regard information as an a priori mathematical or logical concept, but as something whose nature and properties are determined by the laws of physics alone. It does not suffer from the circularity at the foundations of existing information theory (namely that information and distinguishability are each defined in terms of the other). It explains the relationship between classical and quantum information, and reveals the single, constructor-theoretic property underlying the most distinctive phenomena associated with the latter, including the lack of in-principle distinguishability of some states, the impossibility of cloning, the existence of pairs of variables that cannot simultaneously have sharp values, the fact that measurement processes can be both deterministic and unpredictable, the irreducible perturbation caused by measurement, and entanglement (locally inaccessible information)."
1862,1405.5185,2014,5,23,10,Quantum and Classical in Adiabatic Computation,P J D Crowley;T Duric;Walter Vinci;Paul A Warburton;A G Green,"Adiabatic transport provides a powerful way to manipulate quantum states. By preparing a system in a readily initialised state and then slowly changing its Hamiltonian, one may achieve quantum states that would otherwise be inaccessible. Moreover, a judicious choice of final Hamiltonian whose groundstate encodes the solution to a problem allows adiabatic transport to be used for universal quantum computation. However, the dephasing effects of the environment limit the quantum correlations that an open system can support and degrade the power of such adiabatic computation. We quantify this effect by allowing the system to evolve over a restricted set of quantum states, providing a link between physically inspired classical optimisation algorithms and quantum adiabatic optimisation. This new perspective allows us to develop benchmarks to bound the quantum correlations harnessed by an adiabatic computation. We apply these to the D-Wave Vesuvius machine with revealing - though inconclusive - results."
1863,1405.5029,2014,5,21,10,Towards fully quantum second laws of thermodynamics: limitations on the evolution of quantum coherences,Piotr Ćwikliński;Michał Studziński;Michał Horodecki;Jonathan Oppenheim,"The second law of thermodynamics places a limitation into which states a system can evolve into. For systems in contact with a heat bath, it can be combined with the law of energy conservation, and it says that a system can only evolve into another if the free energy goes down. Recently, it's been shown that there are actually many second laws, and that it is only for large macroscopic systems that they all become equivalent to the ordinary one. These additional second laws also hold for quantum systems, and are, in fact, often more relevant in this regime. They place a restriction on how the probabilities of energy levels can evolve. Here, we consider additional restrictions on how the coherences between energy levels can evolve. Coherences can only go down, and we provide a set of restrictions which limit the extent to which they can be maintained. We find that coherences over energy levels must decay at rates that are suitably adapted to the transition rates between energy levels. We show that the limitations are matched in the case of a single qubit, in which case we obtain the full characterization of state-to-state transformations. For higher dimensions, we conjecture that more severe constraints exist. We also introduce a new class of thermodynamical operations which allow for greater manipulation of coherences and study its power with respect to a class of operations known as thermal operations."
1864,1405.3211,2014,5,21,10,Bell Inequalities with Communication Assistance,Katherine Maxwell;Eric Chitambar,"In this paper we consider the possible correlations between two parties using local machines and shared randomness with an additional amount of classical communication. This is a continuation of the work initiated by Bacon and Toner in Ref. [\textitPhys. Rev. Lett. \textbf90, 157904 (2003)] who characterized the correlation polytope for $2\times 2$ measurement settings with binary outcomes plus one bit of communication. Here, we derive a complete set of Bell Inequalities for $3\times 2$ measurement settings and a shared bit of communication. When the communication direction is fixed, nine Bell Inequalities characterize the correlation polytope, whereas when the communication direction is bi-directional, 143 inequalities describe the correlations. We then prove a tight lower bound on the amount of communication needed to simulate all no-signaling correlations for a given number of measurement settings."
1865,1405.1945,2014,5,14,10,Operator space approach to steering inequality,Michał Horodecki;Marcin Marciniak;Zhi Yin,"In \citeJP2011,JPPVW2010 the operator space theory was applied to study bipartite Bell inequalities. The aim of the paper is to follow this line of research and use the operator space technique to analyze the steering scenario. We obtain a bipartite steering functional with unbounded largest violation of steering inequality, as well as we can construct all ingredients explicitly. It turns out that the unbounded largest violation is obtained by non maximally entangled state. Moreover, we focus on the bipartite dichotomic case where we construct a steering functional with unbounded largest violation of steering inequality. This phenomenon is different to the Bell scenario where only bounded largest violation can be obtained by any bipartite dichotomic Bell functional."
1866,1404.3774,2014,5,9,10,SIC-POVMs and Compatibility among Quantum States,Blake C Stacey,"An unexpected connection exists between compatibility criteria for quantum states and symmetric informationally complete POVMs. Beginning with Caves, Fuchs and Schack's ""Conditions for compatibility of quantum state assignments"" [Phys. Rev. A 66 (2002), 062111], I show that a qutrit SIC-POVM studied in other contexts enjoys additional interesting properties. Compatibility criteria provide a new way to understand the relationship between SIC-POVMs and mutually unbiased bases, as calculations in the SIC representation of quantum states make clear. This, in turn, illuminates the resources necessary for magic-state quantum computation, and why hidden-variable models fail to capture the vitality of quantum mechanics."
1867,1404.1444,2014,4,8,10,Entanglement Typicality,Oscar C O Dahlsten;Cosmo Lupo;Stefano Mancini;Alessio Serafini,"We provide a summary of both seminal and recent results on typical entanglement. By typical values of entanglement, we refer here to values of entanglement quantifiers that (given a reasonable measure on the manifold of states) appear with arbitrarily high probability for quantum systems of sufficiently high dimensionality. We work within the Haar measure framework for discrete quantum variables, where we report on results concerning the average von Neumann and linear entropies as well as arguments implying the typicality of such values in the asymptotic limit. We then proceed to discuss the generation of typical quantum states with random circuitry. Different phases of entanglement, and the connection between typical entanglement and thermodynamics are discussed. We also cover approaches to measures on the non-compact set of Gaussian states of continuous variable quantum systems."
1868,1403.5395,2014,3,24,10,"Entanglement, Tensor Networks and Black Hole Horizons",Javier Molina-Vilaplana;Javier Prior,"We elaborate on a previous proposal by Hartman and Maldacena on a tensor network which accounts for the scaling of the entanglement entropy in a system at a finite temperature. In this construction, the ordinary entanglement renormalization flow given by the class of tensor networks known as the Multi Scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), is supplemented by an additional entanglement structure at the length scale fixed by the temperature. The network comprises two copies of a MERA circuit with a fixed number of layers and a pure matrix product state which joins both copies by entangling the infrared degrees of freedom of both MERA networks. The entanglement distribution within this bridge state defines reduced density operators on both sides which cause analogous effects to the presence of a black hole horizon when computing the entanglement entropy at finite temperature in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The entanglement and correlations during the thermalization process of a system after a quantum quench are also analyzed. To this end, a full tensor network representation of the action of local unitary operations on the bridge state is proposed. This amounts to a tensor network which grows in size by adding succesive layers of bridge states. Finally, we discuss on the holographic interpretation of the tensor network through a notion of distance within the network which emerges from its entanglement distribution."
1869,1403.2228,2014,3,11,10,Global Symmetry is Unnecessary for Fast Quantum Search,Jonatan Janmark;David A Meyer;Thomas G Wong,"Grover's quantum search algorithm can be formulated as a quantum particle randomly walking on the (highly symmetric) complete graph, with one vertex marked by a nonzero potential. From an initial equal superposition, the state evolves in a two-dimensional subspace. Strongly regular graphs have a local symmetry that ensures that the state evolves in a \emphthree-dimensional subspace, but most have no \emphglobal symmetry. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that quantum random walk search on known families of strongly regular graphs nevertheless achieves the full quantum speedup of $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, disproving the intuition that fast quantum search requires global symmetry."
1870,1403.1658,2014,3,10,10,Highly-mixed measurement-based quantum computing and the one clean qubit model,Tomoyuki Morimae,"We show that a highly-mixed state in terms of a large min-entropy is useless as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation in the sense that if a classically efficiently verifiable problem is efficiently solved with such a highly-mixed measurement-based quantum computation then such a problem can also be classically efficiently solved. We derive a similar result also for the DQC1$_k$ model, which is a generalized version of the DQC1 model where $k$ output qubits are measured. We also show that the measurement-based quantum computing on a highly-mixed resource state in terms of the von Neumann entropy, and DQC1$_k$ model are useless in another sense that the mutual information between the computation results and inputs is very small."

Remarkably, this class of witnesses is parameterized by a torus being a maximal commutative subgroup of an orthogonal group SO(n-1). It is shown that a generic element from the class defines an indecomposable entanglement witness. The paper provides a geometric perspective for some aspects of the entanglement theory and an interesting interplay between group theory and block-positive operators."

There exists a finite region in the phase diagram such that the thermal equilibrium states are capable of providing a universal fault-tolerant resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Moreover, in such a region the thermal resource states on the 3D lattices can enable topological protection for quantum computation. The two models behave similarly in terms of quantum computational power. However, they have different properties in terms of the usual phase transitions. The first model has a first-order phase transition only at zero temperature whereas there is no transition at all in the second model. Interestingly, the transition in the quantum computational power does not coincide with the phase transition in the first model."
1873,1402.3037,2014,2,14,10,Efficient fault-tolerant decoding of topological color codes,Ashley M Stephens,"Topological color codes defined by the 4.8.8 semiregular lattice feature geometrically local check operators and admit transversal implementation of the entire Clifford group, making them promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Recently, several efficient algorithms for decoding the syndrome of color codes were proposed. Here, we modify one of these algorithms to account for errors affecting the syndrome, applying it to the family of triangular 4.8.8 color codes encoding one logical qubit. For a three-dimensional bit-flip channel, we report a threshold error rate of 0.0208(1), compared with 0.0305(4) previously reported for an integer-program-based decoding algorithm. When we account for circuit details, this threshold is reduced to 0.00143(1) per gate, compared with 0.00672(1) per gate for the surface code under an identical noise model."
1874,1402.0049,2014,2,4,10,Single-shot security for one-time memories in the isolated qubits model,Yi-Kai Liu,"One-time memories (OTM's) are simple, tamper-resistant cryptographic devices, which can be used to implement sophisticated functionalities such as one-time programs. Can one construct OTM's whose security follows from some physical principle? This is not possible in a fully-classical world, or in a fully-quantum world, but there is evidence that OTM's can be built using ""isolated qubits"" -- qubits that cannot be entangled, but can be accessed using adaptive sequences of single-qubit measurements. Here we present new constructions for OTM's using isolated qubits, which improve on previous work in several respects: they achieve a stronger ""single-shot"" security guarantee, which is stated in terms of the (smoothed) min-entropy; they are proven secure against adversaries who can perform arbitrary local operations and classical communication (LOCC); and they are efficiently implementable. These results use Wiesner's idea of conjugate coding, combined with error-correcting codes that approach the capacity of the q-ary symmetric channel, and a high-order entropic uncertainty relation, which was originally developed for cryptography in the bounded quantum storage model."
1875,1401.8127,2014,2,3,10,Computational advantage from quantum-controlled ordering of gates,Mateus Araújo;Fabio Costa;Časlav Brukner,"It is usually assumed that a quantum computation is performed by applying gates in a specific order. One can relax this assumption by allowing a control quantum system to switch the order in which the gates are applied. This provides a more general kind of quantum computing, that allows transformations on blackbox quantum gates that are impossible in a circuit with fixed order. Here we show that this model of quantum computing is physically realizable, by proposing an interferometric setup that can implement such a quantum control of the order between the gates. We show that this new resource provides a reduction in computational complexity: we propose a problem that can be solved using $O(n)$ blackbox queries, whereas the best known quantum algorithm with fixed order between the gates requires $O(n^2)$ queries. Furthermore, we conjecture that solving this problem in a classical computer takes exponential time, which may be of independent interest."

To do so, we first give two model independent definition of the dimension of physical systems, based on measurements and on the capacity of storing information. While both definitions are equivalent in classical and quantum mechanics, they are in general different in generalized probabilistic theories. We discuss in detail the case of a theory known as 'boxworld', and show that such a theory features systems with a dimension mismatch. This dimension mismatch can be made arbitrarily large by using an amplification procedure. Furthermore, we show that the dimension mismatch of boxworld has strong consequences on its power for performing information-theoretic tasks, leading to the collapse of communication complexity and to the violation of information causality. Finally, we discuss the consequences of a dimension mismatch from the perspective of thermodynamics, and ask whether this effect could break Landauer's erasure principle and thus the second law."

One such algorithm, quantum annealing (QA), provides a promising path to a practical quantum processor. We have built a series of scalable QA processors consisting of networks of manufactured interacting spins (qubits). Here, we use qubit tunneling spectroscopy to measure the energy eigenspectrum of two- and eight-qubit systems within one such processor, demonstrating quantum coherence in these systems. We present experimental evidence that, during a critical portion of QA, the qubits become entangled and that entanglement persists even as these systems reach equilibrium with a thermal environment. Our results provide an encouraging sign that QA is a viable technology for large-scale quantum computing."

We study this in the context of 3d topological quantum field theory, where we show that the formation of a wormhole is the same process as creating a particle-antiparticle pair. A key feature of the ER=EPR proposal is that certain apparently entangled degrees of freedom turn out to be the same. We name this phenomenon ""fake entanglement"", and show how it arises in our topological quantum field theory model."

This work gives the number $N_{\hat{m},\hat{n}}(U)$ as a function of $U$. Here a rotation means an element $D$ of the special orthogonal group ${\rm SO}(3)$ or an element of the special unitary group ${\rm SU}(2)$ that corresponds to $D$. Decompositions of $U$ attaining the minimum number $N_{\hat{m},\hat{n}}(U)$ are also given explicitly."

Thus, a natural measure of nonlocal correlations is provided by the minimal amount of communication required for classically simulating them. In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal communication cost, which we call nonlocal capacity, for any general nonsignaling correlations. This measure turns out to have an important role in communication complexity and can be used to discriminate between local and nonlocal correlations, as an alternative to the violation of Bell's inequalities."

They rely on the electromagnetic field associated with photons to carry information from one point to another in space. As a result, a complete physical model of these channels must necessarily take quantum effects into account in order to determine their ultimate performances. Specifically, Gaussian photonic (or bosonic) quantum channels have been extensively studied over the past decades given their importance for practical purposes. In spite of this, a longstanding conjecture on the optimality of Gaussian encodings has yet prevented finding their communication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the vacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of a generic Gaussian bosonic channel. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy constraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical capacity of these channels is additive. Beyond capacities, it also has broad consequences in quantum information sciences."
1882,1312.4431,2013,12,17,10,Maximally strong entropic uncertainty relations and gauge invariance,Cosmo Lupo;Seth Lloyd,"Uncertainty relations are among the unique fingerprints of quantum physics, being direct expression of non-commutativity and complementarity. Entropic uncertainty relations arise in quantum information theory as the most natural expression of the uncertainty principle and have proven themselves important tools for cryptographic security proofs. An open question has been how strong entropic uncertainty relations can be. Here we answer this question by showing that there exist observables that obey maximally strong entropic uncertainty relations in high dimensional Hilbert spaces. Actually, we show that maximally strong uncertainty relations are typically verified if the observables are distributed somehow uniformly. In particular, we show that phase randomness in a mutually unbiased basis is sufficient, providing a link between uncertainty relations and local gauge invariance. For quantum systems of finite dimensions our approach provides an explicit relation between the strength of the uncertainty and its probability."

The treatment assumes very little mathematical knowledge (mainly just vector analysis and some idea of what a group is). The SU(2)--SO(3) homomorphism is presented in detail. Lorentz transformation, chirality, and the spinor Minkowski metric are introduced. Applications to electromagnetism, parity violation, and to Dirac spinors are presented. A classical form of the Dirac equation is obtained, and the (quantum) prediction that $g=2$ for Dirac particles is presented."

The computational hardness of Boson-Sampling, however, complicates the certification that an experimental device yields correct results in the regime in which it outmatches classical computers. To certify a boson-sampler, one needs to verify quantum predictions and rule out models that yield these predictions without true many-boson interference. We show that a semiclassical model for many-boson propagation reproduces coarse-grained observables that were proposed as witnesses of Boson-Sampling. A test based on Fourier matrices is demonstrated to falsify physically plausible alternatives to coherent many-boson propagation."
1885,1312.1940,2013,12,9,10,Testing randomness with photons,Jonathan C F Matthews;Rebecca Whittaker;Jeremy L O'Brien;Peter S Turner,"Generating and characterising randomness is fundamentally important in both classical and quantum information science. Here we report the experimental demonstration of ensembles of pseudorandom optical processes comprising what are known as t-designs. We show that in practical scenarios, certain finite ensembles of two-mode transformations---1- and 2-designs---are indistinguishable from truly random operations for 1- and 2-photon quantum interference, but they fail to mimic randomness for 2- and 3-photon cases, respectively. This provides a novel optical test of pseudo randomness. We make use of the fact that t-photon behaviour is governed by degree-2t polynomials in the parameters of the optical process to experimentally verify the ensembles' behaviour for complete bases of polynomials. This ensures that outputs will be uniform for arbitrary configurations, satisfying the strict definition of pseudorandomness implicit in the mathematical definition."
1886,1311.2128,2013,11,12,10,Quantum Commuting Circuits and Complexity of Ising Partition Functions,Keisuke Fujii;Tomoyuki Morimae,"Instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) computation is a class of quantum computation consisting only of commuting two-qubit gates and is not universal in the sense of standard quantum computation. Nevertheless, it has been shown that if there is a classical algorithm that can simulate IQP efficiently, the polynomial hierarchy (PH) collapses at the third level, which is highly implausible. However, the origin of the classical intractability is still less understood. Here we establish a relationship between IQP and computational complexity of the partition functions of Ising models. We apply the established relationship in two opposite directions. One direction is to find subclasses of IQP that are classically efficiently simulatable in the strong sense, by using exact solvability of certain types of Ising models. Another direction is applying quantum computational complexity of IQP to investigate (im)possibility of efficient classical approximations of Ising models with imaginary coupling constants. Specifically, we show that there is no fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for Ising models with almost all imaginary coupling constants even on a planar graph of a bounded degree, unless the PH collapses at the third level. Furthermore, we also show a multiplicative approximation of such a class of Ising partition functions is at least as hard as a multiplicative approximation for the output distribution of an arbitrary quantum circuit."
1887,1310.8302,2013,10,31,10,No $\psi$-epistemic model can fully explain the indistinguishability of quantum states,Jonathan Barrett;Eric G Cavalcanti;Raymond Lal;Owen J E Maroney,"According to a recent no-go theorem (M. Pusey, J. Barrett and T. Rudolph, Nature Physics 8, 475 (2012)), models in which quantum states correspond to probability distributions over the values of some underlying physical variables must have the following feature: the distributions corresponding to distinct quantum states do not overlap. This is significant because if the distributions do not overlap, then the quantum state itself is encoded by the physical variables. In such a model, it cannot coherently be maintained that the quantum state merely encodes information about underlying physical variables. The theorem, however, considers only models in which the physical variables corresponding to independently prepared systems are independent. This work considers models that are defined for a single quantum system of dimension $d$, such that the independence condition does not arise. We prove a result in a similar spirit to the original no-go theorem, in the form of an upper bound on the extent to which the probability distributions can overlap, consistently with reproducing quantum predictions. In particular, models in which the quantum overlap between pure states is equal to the classical overlap between the corresponding probability distributions cannot reproduce the quantum predictions in any dimension $d \geq 3$. The result is noise tolerant, and an experiment is motivated to distinguish the class of models ruled out from quantum theory."

Our approach differs from previous ones in two points: First, it supports a reasoning inspired by the method of types. Second, the measurement scheme we propose to distinguish the two alternatives not only does that job asymptotically perfect, but also yields additional information about the null hypothesis. An example of that is given. The measurement is composed of projections onto permutation-invariant subspaces, thus providing a direct link between one of the most basic tasks in quantum information on the one hand side and fundamental objects in representation theory on the other. We additionally connect to representation theory by proving a relation between Kostka numbers and quantum states, and to state estimation via a generalization of a well-known spectral estimation theorem to non-i.i.d. sequences."

We show that by using tools from quantum error-correction this limitation can be overcome. This is demonstrated in two scenarios, including a many-body Hamiltonian with single-qubit dephasing or depolarizing noise, and a single-body Hamiltonian with transversal noise. In both cases we show that Heisenberg scaling, and hence a quadratic improvement over the classical case, can be retained. Moreover, for the case of frequency estimation we find that the inclusion of error-correction allows, in certain instances, for a finite optimal interrogation time even in the asymptotic limit."

We identify the conditions under which QEC allows one to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in quantum-limited measurements, and we demonstrate that it enables, in certain situations, Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. We discuss specific applications to nanoscale sensing using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond in which QEC can significantly improve the measurement sensitivity and bandwidth under realistic experimental conditions."

Results well-known in that field imply that GHZ states can be transformed into W states at rate 1 for any number of parties. As a generalization, we find that the asymptotic conversion rate from GHZ states to Dicke states is bounded as the number of subsystems increase and the number of excitations is fixed. By generalizing constructions of Coppersmith and Winograd and by using monotones introduced by Strassen we also compute the conversion rate from W to GHZ states."
1892,1310.2856,2013,10,11,10,Quantum Subdivision Capacities and Continuous-time Quantum Coding,Alexander Müller-Hermes;David Reeb;Michael M Wolf,"Quantum memories can be regarded as quantum channels that transmit information through time without moving it through space. Aiming at a reliable storage of information we may thus not only encode at the beginning and decode at the end, but also intervene during the transmission - a possibility not captured by the ordinary capacities in Quantum Shannon Theory. In this work we introduce capacities that take this possibility into account and study them in particular for the transmission of quantum information via dynamical semigroups of Lindblad form. When the evolution is subdivided and supplemented by additional continuous semigroups acting on arbitrary block sizes, we show that the capacity of the ideal channel can be obtained in all cases. If the supplementary evolution is reversible, however, this is no longer the case. Upper and lower bounds for this scenario are proven. Finally, we provide a continuous coding scheme and simple examples showing that adding a purely dissipative term to a Liouvillian can sometimes increase the quantum capacity."
1893,1310.0746,2013,10,3,10,Modulus of convexity for operator convex functions,Isaac H Kim,"Given an operator convex function $f(x)$, we obtain an operator-valued lower bound for $cf(x) + (1-c)f(y) - f(cx + (1-c)y)$, $c \in [0,1]$. The lower bound is expressed in terms of the matrix Bregman divergence. A similar inequality is shown to be false for functions that are convex but not operator convex."
1894,1310.0284,2013,10,2,10,Causal structures from entropic information: Geometry and novel scenarios,Rafael Chaves;Lukas Luft;David Gross,"The fields of quantum non-locality in physics, and causal discovery in machine learning, both face the problem of deciding whether observed data is compatible with a presumed causal relationship between the variables (for example a local hidden variable model). Traditionally, Bell inequalities have been used to describe the restrictions imposed by causal structures on marginal distributions. However, some structures give rise to non-convex constraints on the accessible data, and it has recently been noted that linear inequalities on the observable entropies capture these situations more naturally. In this paper, we show the versatility of the entropic approach by greatly expanding the set of scenarios for which entropic constraints are known. For the first time, we treat Bell scenarios involving multiple parties and multiple observables per party. Going beyond the usual Bell setup, we exhibit inequalities for scenarios with extra conditional independence assumptions, as well as a limited amount of shared randomness between the parties. Many of our results are based on a geometric observation: Bell polytopes for two-outcome measurements can be naturally imbedded into the convex cone of attainable marginal entropies. Thus, any entropic inequality can be translated into one valid for probabilities. In some situations the converse also holds, which provides us with a rich source of candidate entropic inequalities."

We introduce a stabilizer formalism for GCQCs, which is achieved by defining quantum coset codes. This formalism offers a new perspective for GCQCs and enables us to derive a lower bound on the code distance of stabilizer GCQCs from component codes parameters,for both non-degenerate and degenerate component codes. Our formalism also shows how to exploit the error-correcting capacity of component codes to design good GCQCs efficiently."

Firstly, we show that the entanglement transformation rate from $\ket{GHZ}=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{000}+\ket{111})$ to $\ket{W}=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\ket{100}+\ket{010}+\ket{001})$ is 1, that is, one can obtain 1 copy of $W$-state, from 1 copy of $GHZ$-state by SLOCC, asymptotically. We then generalize this result to a lower bound on the rate that from $N$-partite $GHZ$-state to Dicke states. For some special cases, the optimality of this bound is proved. We then discuss the tensor rank of matrix permanent by evaluating the the tensor rank of Dicke state."

We show that the effective low-energy model for any region acts on the entanglement degrees of freedom at the boundary, corresponding to physical excitations located at the edge. This allows us to determine the edge Hamiltonian in the vicinity of PEPS models, and we demonstrate that by choosing the appropriate bulk perturbation, the edge Hamiltonian can exhibit a rich phase diagram and phase transitions. While for models in the trivial phase any Hamiltonian can be realized at the edge, we show that for topological models, the edge Hamiltonian is constrained by the topological order in the bulk which can e.g. protect a ferromagnetic Ising chain at the edge against spontaneous symmetry breaking."
1898,1309.2643,2013,9,11,10,Noisy Interactive Quantum Communication,Gilles Brassard;Alain Tapp;Dave Touchette,"We study the problem of simulating protocols in a quantum communication setting over noisy channels. This problem falls at the intersection of quantum information theory and quantum communication complexity, and is of particular importance for real-world applications of interactive quantum protocols, which can be proved to have exponentially lower communication costs than their classical counterparts for some problems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results regarding the quantum version of this problem, first studied by Schulman in a classical setting (FOCS '92, STOC '93). We simulate a length N quantum communication protocol by a length O(N) protocol. Our simulation strategy has a far higher communication rate than the naive one that encodes each particular round of communication to achieve comparable success. In particular, such a strategy would have a communication rate going to 0 in the worst interaction case as the length of the protocols increases, in contrast to our strategy, which has a communication rate proportional to the capacity of the channel used. Under adversarial noise, our strategy can withstand error rates up to 1/2 when parties preshare perfect entanglement, and this even if they are only allowed noisy classical communication. We show that this is optimal. This is in contrast to the case of the naive strategy, which would not work for any constant fraction of errors in this model. When the parties do not preshare entanglement, we show how to tolerate adversarial error rates close to the maximum tolerable for one-way quantum data transmission. In a random noise setting with a quantum channel of capacity Q > 0, the communication rate is proportional to Q."
1899,1308.5884,2013,8,28,10,Smooth Max-Information as One-Shot Generalization for Mutual Information,Nikola Ciganović;Normand J Beaudry;Renato Renner,"We study formal properties of smooth max-information, a generalization of von Neumann mutual information derived from the max-relative entropy. Recent work suggests that it is a useful quantity in one-shot channel coding, quantum rate distortion theory and the physics of quantum many-body systems. Max-information can be defined in multiple ways. We demonstrate that different smoothed definitions are essentially equivalent (up to logarithmic terms in the smoothing parameters). These equivalence relations allow us to derive new chain rules for the max-information in terms of min- and max-entropies, thus extending the smooth entropy formalism to mutual information."
1900,1308.4776,2013,8,23,10,High-threshold topological quantum error correction against biased noise,Ashley M Stephens;William J Munro;Kae Nemoto,"Quantum information can be protected from decoherence and other errors, but only if these errors are sufficiently rare. For quantum computation to become a scalable technology, practical schemes for quantum error correction that can tolerate realistically high error rates will be necessary. In some physical systems, errors may exhibit a characteristic structure that can be carefully exploited to improve the efficacy of error correction. Here, we describe a scheme for topological quantum error correction to protect quantum information from a dephasing-biased error model, where we combine a repetition code with a topological cluster state. We find that the scheme tolerates error rates of up to 1.37%-1.83% per gate, requiring only short-range interactions in a two-dimensional array."
1901,1308.4283,2013,8,21,10,Entanglement-assisted zero-error source-channel coding,Jop Briët;Harry Buhrman;Monique Laurent;Teresa Piovesan;Giannicola Scarpa,"We study the use of quantum entanglement in the zero-error source-channel coding problem. Here, Alice and Bob are connected by a noisy classical one-way channel, and are given correlated inputs from a random source. Their goal is for Bob to learn Alice's input while using the channel as little as possible. In the zero-error regime, the optimal rates of source codes and channel codes are given by graph parameters known as the Witsenhausen rate and Shannon capacity, respectively. The Lovász theta number, a graph parameter defined by a semidefinite program, gives the best efficiently-computable upper bound on the Shannon capacity and it also upper bounds its entanglement-assisted counterpart. At the same time it was recently shown that the Shannon capacity can be increased if Alice and Bob may use entanglement. Here we partially extend these results to the source-coding problem and to the more general source-channel coding problem. We prove a lower bound on the rate of entanglement-assisted source-codes in terms Szegedy's number (a strengthening of the theta number). This result implies that the theta number lower bounds the entangled variant of the Witsenhausen rate. We also show that entanglement can allow for an unbounded improvement of the asymptotic rate of both classical source codes and classical source-channel codes. Our separation results use low-degree polynomials due to Barrington, Beigel and Rudich, Hadamard matrices due to Xia and Liu and a new application of remote state preparation."

We consider ensembles of random problems characterized by a fixed clause density, an order parameter which we tune through its critical value in our experiments. We demonstrate that the DW1 is sensitive to the critical value of the clause density. The DW1 results are verified and compared with akmaxsat, an exact, state-of-the-art algorithm. We study the relative performance of the two solvers and how they correlate in terms of problem hardness. We find that the DW1 performance scales more favorably with problem size and that problem hardness correlation is essentially non-existent. We discuss the relevance and limitations of such a comparison."

Specifically the quantum simulator would efficiently generate qubit-string states that closely approximate physical states obtained from a broad class of dynamical evolutions. I provide an overview of theoretical research into universal quantum simulators and the strategies for minimizing computational space and time costs. Applications to simulating many-body quantum simulation and solving linear equations are discussed.

Here, we propose to study how well m nodes in a quantum network can establish a common reference frame from scratch, even though t of them may be arbitrarily faulty. We present a protocol that allows all correctly functioning nodes to agree on a common reference frame as long as not more than t < m/3 nodes are faulty. Our protocol furthermore has the appealing property that it allows any existing two-party protocol for reference frame agreement to be lifted to a protocol for a quantum network."

The order parameter can be computed from the ground state entanglement entropy of some regions near one of the boundaries. Hence, it is well-defined even in the presence of arbitrary interaction and disorder. We also show that it is invariant under a finite-depth local quantum circuit, suggesting its stability against an arbitrary local perturbation that does not close the energy gap. Further, it can unambiguously distinguish Majorana chain from a trivial chain under a global fermion parity conservation. We argue that the order parameter can be in principle measured in an optical lattice system."

Using quasi-adiabatic evolution of the groundstate around a flux-torus, we prove, without any averaging assumption, that the Hall conductance of the groundstate is quantized in integer multiples of e^2/h, up to exponentially small corrections in the linear size of the system. In addition, we discuss extensions to the fractional quantization case under an additional topological order assumption on the degenerate groundstate subspace."

We prove an analog of Sabidussi's theorem for each of these parameters, i.e. that for each of the parameters, the value on the Cartesian product of graphs is equal to the maximum of the values on the factors. We also prove an analog of Hedetniemi's conjecture for Lovasz theta of the complement, i.e. that its value on the categorical product of graphs is equal to the minimum of its values on the factors. We conjecture that the analogous results hold for vector and quantum chromatic number, and we prove that this is the case for some special classes of graphs."

Our approach uses the decomposition of the single-qubit channel into a convex combination of ""quasiextreme"" channels. Previous techniques for simulating general single-qubit channels would require as many as 20 CNOT gates, whereas ours only needs one, bringing it within the range of current experiments."

We also showed that the set K_k,t is obtained, up to an intersection, as the unit ball of the dual of a free compression norm. In this paper, we identify the maximum of l^p norms on the set K_k,t and prove that the maximum is attained on a vector of shape (a,b,...,b) where a > b. In particular, we compute the precise limit value of the minimum output entropy of a single random quantum channel. As a corollary, we show that for any eps > 0, it is possible to obtain a violation for the additivity of the minimum output entropy for an output dimension as low as 183, and that for appropriate choice of parameters, the violation can be as large as log 2 - eps. Conversely, our result implies that, with probability one, one does not obtain a violation of additivity using conjugate random quantum channels and the Bell state, in dimension 182 and less."

The new approach yields an efficient quantum algorithm for the bivariate HPGP even when the input consists of several level set superpositions, a more difficult version of the problem than the one where the input is given by an oracle. For constant degree, the algorithm is polylogarithmic in the size of the base field. We also apply the results to give an efficient quantum algorithm for the oracle version of the HPP for an interesting family of bivariate hidden functions. This family includes diagonal quadratic forms and elliptic curves."

We provide an elementary construction of the ellipsoid for arbitrary states, calculate its volume, and explain how this geometric representation can be made faithful. The representation provides a range of new results, and uncovers new features, such as the existence of ""incomplete steering"" in separable states. We show that entanglement can be analysed in terms of three geometric features of the ellipsoid, and prove that a state is separable if and only if it obeys a ""nested tetrahedron"" condition."
1913,1303.1760,2013,3,8,10,Family of Finite Geometry Low-Density Parity-Check Codes for Quantum Key Expansion,Kung-Chuan Hsu;Todd A Brun,"We consider a quantum key expansion (QKE) protocol based on entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). In these protocols, a seed of a previously shared secret key is used in the post-processing stage of a standard quantum key distribution protocol like the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol, in order to produce a larger secret key. This protocol was proposed by Luo and Devetak, but codes leading to good performance have not been investigated. We look into a family of EAQECCs generated by classical finite geometry (FG) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, for which very efficient iterative decoders exist. A critical observation is that almost all errors in the resulting secret key result from uncorrectable block errors that can be detected by an additional syndrome check and an additional sampling step. Bad blocks can then be discarded. We make some changes to the original protocol to avoid the consumption of the preshared key when the protocol fails. This allows us to greatly reduce the bit error rate of the key at the cost of a minor reduction in the key production rate, but without increasing the consumption rate of the preshared key. We present numerical simulations for the family of FG LDPC codes, and show that this improved QKE protocol has a good net key production rate even at relatively high error rates, for appropriate choices of these codes."
1914,1302.6990,2013,2,28,10,Stabilizer information inequalities from phase space distributions,David Gross;Michael Walter,"The Shannon entropy of a collection of random variables is subject to a number of constraints, the best-known examples being monotonicity and strong subadditivity. It remains an open question to decide which of these ""laws of information theory"" are also respected by the von Neumann entropy of many-body quantum states. In this article, we consider a toy version of this difficult problem by analyzing the von Neumann entropy of stabilizer states. We find that the von Neumann entropy of stabilizer states satisfies all balanced information inequalities that hold in the classical case. Our argument is built on the fact that stabilizer states have a classical model, provided by the discrete Wigner function: The phase-space entropy of the Wigner function corresponds directly to the von Neumann entropy of the state, which allows us to reduce to the classical case. Our result has a natural counterpart for multi-mode Gaussian states, which sheds some light on the general properties of the construction. We also discuss the relation of our results to recent work by Linden, Ruskai, and Winter."

Each vertex of the graph represents a generic interaction between subsystems, described by a random unitary matrix distributed according to the Haar measure, while each edge of the graph represents a bi-partite, maximally entangled state. For any splitting of the graph into two parts we consider the corresponding partition of the quantum system and compute the average entropy of entanglement. First, in the special case where the partition does not ""cross"" any vertex of the graph, we show that the area law is satisfied exactly. In the general case, we show that the entropy of entanglement obeys an area law on average, this time with a correction term that depends on the topologies of the graph and of the partition. The results obtained are applied to the problem of distribution of quantum entanglement in a quantum network with prescribed topology."

The techniques employed work for bounded semigroups, in particular for classical as well as for quantum Markov chains and they do not require additional assumptions like detailed balance, irreducibility or aperiodicity. We use the method in order to derive convergence bounds that improve significantly upon known spectral bounds. The core technical observation is that power-boundedness of transition maps of Markov chains enables a Wiener algebra functional calculus in order to upper bound any norm of any holomorphic function of the transition map. Finally, we discuss how general detailed balance conditions for quantum Markov processes lead to spectral convergence bounds."

I show that the overhead for magic-state distillation can be reduced by merging distillation with the implementation of Toffoli gates. The resulting routine distills 8 one-qubit magic states directly to a Toffoli state, which can be used without further magic to perform a Toffoli gate."

This task is a crucial ingredient of any attempt to produce perfectly random numbers---required, for instance, by cryptographic protocols, numerical simulations, or randomised computations. Trevisan's extractor raised considerable theoretical interest not only because of its data parsimony compared to other constructions, but particularly because it is secure against quantum adversaries, making it applicable to quantum key distribution. We discuss a modular, extensible and high-performance implementation of the construction based on various building blocks that can be flexibly combined to satisfy the requirements of a wide range of scenarios. Besides quantitatively analysing the properties of many combinations in practical settings, we improve previous theoretical proofs, and give explicit results for non-asymptotic cases. The self-contained description does not assume familiarity with extractors."

As is often the case in quantum probability, there is not just one but several quantizations: we know at least two different concepts of identification of classical information via quantum channels, and three different identification capacities for quantum information. In the present summary overview we concentrate on conceptual points and open problems, referring the reader to the small set of original articles for details."
1921,1211.1400,2012,11,8,10,Fault-tolerant quantum computation with asymmetric Bacon-Shor codes,Peter Brooks;John Preskill,"We develop a scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation based on asymmetric Bacon-Shor codes, which works effectively against highly biased noise dominated by dephasing. We find the optimal Bacon-Shor block size as a function of the noise strength and the noise bias, and estimate the logical error rate and overhead cost achieved by this optimal code. Our fault-tolerant gadgets, based on gate teleportation, are well suited for hardware platforms with geometrically local gates in two dimensions."

We show that the standard approach of process tomography is grossly inaccurate in the case where the states and measurement operators used to interrogate the system are generated by gates that have some systematic error, a situation all but unavoidable in any practical setting. These errors in tomography can not be fully corrected through oversampling or by performing a larger set of experiments. We present an alternative method for tomography to reconstruct an entire library of gates in a self-consistent manner. The essential ingredient is to define a likelihood function that assumes nothing about the gates used for preparation and measurement. In order to make the resulting optimization tractable we linearize about the target, a reasonable approximation when benchmarking a quantum computer as opposed to probing a black-box function."
1923,1210.8412,2012,11,1,10,Hypercontractivity for semigroups of unital qubit channels,Christopher King,"Hypercontractivity is proved for products of qubit channels that belong to self-adjoint semigroups. The hypercontractive bound gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a product of the form e^- t_1 H_1 \ot ... \ot e^- t_n H_n to be a contraction from L^p to L^q, where L^p is the algebra of 2^n-dimensional matrices equipped with the normalized Schatten norm, and each generator H_j is a self-adjoint positive semidefinite operator on the algebra of 2-dimensional matrices. As a particular case the result establishes the hypercontractive bound for a product of qubit depolarizing channels."
1924,1210.7710,2012,10,30,10,"Geometry of Matrix Product States: metric, parallel transport and curvature",Jutho Haegeman;Michaël Mariën;Tobias J Osborne;Frank Verstraete,"We study the geometric properties of the manifold of states described as (uniform) matrix product states. Due to the parameter redundancy in the matrix product state representation, matrix product states have the mathematical structure of a (principal) fiber bundle. The total space or bundle space corresponds to the parameter space, i.e. the space of tensors associated to every physical site. The base manifold is embedded in Hilbert space and can be given the structure of a Kähler manifold by inducing the Hilbert space metric. Our main interest is in the states living in the tangent space to the base manifold, which have recently been shown to be interesting in relation to time dependence and elementary excitations. By lifting these tangent vectors to the (tangent space) of the bundle space using a well-chosen prescription (a principal bundle connection), we can define and efficiently compute an inverse metric, and introduce differential geometric concepts such as parallel transport (related to the Levi-Civita connection) and the Riemann curvature tensor."
1925,1210.5190,2012,10,19,10,Operator extension of strong subadditivity of entropy,Isaac H Kim,"We prove an operator inequality that extends strong subadditivity of entropy: after taking a trace, the operator inequality becomes the strong subadditivity of entropy."
1926,1209.3819,2012,9,19,10,Extending and Characterizing Quantum Magic Games,Alex Arkhipov,"The Mermin-Peres magic square game is a cooperative two-player nonlocal game in which shared quantum entanglement allows the players to win with certainty, while players limited to classical operations cannot do so, a phenomenon dubbed ""quantum pseudo-telepathy"". The game has a referee separately ask each player to color a subset of a 3x3 grid. The referee checks that their colorings satisfy certain parity constraints that can't all be simultaneously realized. We define a generalization of these games to be played on an arbitrary arrangement of intersecting sets of elements. We characterize exactly which of these games exhibit quantum pseudo-telepathy, and give quantum winning strategies for those that do. In doing so, we show that it suffices for the players to share three Bell pairs of entanglement even for games on arbitrarily large arrangements. Moreover, it suffices for Alice and Bob to use measurements from the three-qubit Pauli group. The proof technique uses a novel connection of Mermin-style games to graph planarity."
1927,1208.3660,2012,8,20,10,Positive Wigner functions render classical simulation of quantum computation efficient,Andrea Mari;Jens Eisert,"We show that quantum circuits where the initial state and all the following quantum operations can be represented by positive Wigner functions can be classically efficiently simulated. This is true both for continuous-variable as well as discrete variable systems in odd prime dimensions, two cases which will be treated on entirely the same footing. Noting the fact that Clifford and Gaussian operations preserve the positivity of the Wigner function, our result generalizes the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Our algorithm provides a way of sampling from the output distribution of a computation or a simulation, including the efficient sampling from an approximate output distribution in case of sampling imperfections for initial states, gates, or measurements. In this sense, this work highlights the role of the positive Wigner function as separating classically efficiently simulatable systems from those that are potentially universal for quantum computing and simulation, and it emphasizes the role of negativity of the Wigner function as a computational resource."
1928,1208.0041,2012,8,2,10,Quantum computation by local measurement,Robert Raussendorf;Tzu-Chieh Wei,"Quantum computation is a novel way of information processing which allows, for certain classes of problems, exponential speedups over classical computation. Various models of quantum computation exist, such as the adiabatic, circuit and measurement-based models. They have been proven equivalent in their computational power, but operate very differently. As such, they may be suitable for realization in different physical systems, and also offer different perspectives on open questions such as the precise origin of the quantum speedup. Here, we give an introduction to the one-way quantum computer, a scheme of measurement-based quantum computation. In this model, the computation is driven by local measurements on a carefully chosen, highly entangled state. We discuss various aspects of this computational scheme, such as the role of entanglement and quantum correlations. We also give examples for ground states of simple Hamiltonians which enable universal quantum computation by local measurements."
1929,1207.5846,2012,7,26,10,Fermionic Measurement-based Quantum Computation,Yu-Ju Chiu;Xie Chen;Isaac L Chuang,"Fermions, as a major class of quantum particles, provide platforms for quantum information processing beyond the possibilities of spins or bosons which have been studied more extensively. One particularly interesting model to study, in view of recent progress in manipulating ultracold fermion gases, is the fermionic version of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), which implements full quantum computation with only single site measurements on a proper fermionic many-body resource state. However, it is not known which fermionic states can be used as the resource states for MBQC and how to find them. In this paper, we generalize the framework of spin MBQC to fermions. In particular, we provide a general formalism to construct many-body entangled fermion resource states for MBQC based on the fermionic projected entangled pair state representation. We give a specific fermionic state which enables universal MBQC and demonstrate that the non-locality inherent in fermion systems can be properly taken care of with suitable measurement schemes. Such a framework opens up possibilities of finding MBQC resource states which can be more readily realized in the lab."
1930,1207.3261,2012,7,16,10,Quantum logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and rapid mixing,Michael J Kastoryano;Kristan Temme,"A family of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on finite dimensional quantum state spaces is introduced. The framework of non-commutative $\bL_p$-spaces is reviewed and the relationship between quantum logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and the hypercontractivity of quantum semigroups is discussed. This relationship is central for the derivation of lower bounds for the logarithmic Sobolev (LS) constants. Essential results for the family of inequalities are proved, and we show an upper bound to the generalized LS constant in terms of the spectral gap of the generator of the semigroup. These inequalities provide a framework for the derivation of improved bounds on the convergence time of quantum dynamical semigroups, when the LS constant and the spectral gap are of the same order. Convergence bounds on finite dimensional state spaces are particularly relevant for the field of quantum information theory. We provide a number of examples, where improved bounds on the mixing time of several semigroups are obtained; including the depolarizing semigroup and quantum expanders."
1931,1207.1779,2012,7,10,10,Violating the Shannon capacity of metric graphs with entanglement,Jop Briët;Harry Buhrman;Dion Gijswijt,"The Shannon capacity of a graph G is the maximum asymptotic rate at which messages can be sent with zero probability of error through a noisy channel with confusability graph G. This extensively studied graph parameter disregards the fact that on atomic scales, Nature behaves in line with quantum mechanics. Entanglement, arguably the most counterintuitive feature of the theory, turns out to be a useful resource for communication across noisy channels. Recently, Leung, Mancinska, Matthews, Ozols and Roy [Comm. Math. Phys. 311, 2012] presented two examples of graphs whose Shannon capacity is strictly less than the capacity attainable if the sender and receiver have entangled quantum systems. Here we give new, possibly infinite, families of graphs for which the entangled capacity exceeds the Shannon capacity."
